In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93/////// %–96/////// %), far ahead of Scopus (35/////// %–77/////// %) and WoS (27/////// %–73/////// %). GS found nearly all the WoS (95/////// %) and Scopus (92/////// %) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48/////// %–65/////// %), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19/////// %–38/////// %), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage.",

      "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become one of the most successful frameworks for unsupervised generative modeling. As GANs are difficult to train much research has focused on this. However, very little of this research has directly exploited gametheoretic techniques. We introduce Generative Adversarial Network Games (GANGs), which explicitly model a finite zero-sum game between a generator (G) and classifier (C) that use mixed strategies. The size of these games precludes exact solution methods, therefore we define resource-bounded best responses (RBBRs), and a resourcebounded Nash Equilibrium (RB-NE) as a pair of mixed strategies such that neither G or C can find a better RBBR. The RB-NE solution concept is richer than the notion of ‘local Nash equilibria’ in that it captures not only failures of escaping local optima of gradient descent, but applies to any approximate best response computations, including methods with random restarts. To validate our approach, we solve GANGs with the Parallel Nash Memory algorithm, which provably monotonically converges to an RB-NE. We compare our results to standard GAN setups, and demonstrate that our method deals well with typical GAN problems such as mode collapse, partial mode coverage and forgetting.",

Unfortunately, limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times; instead, we must optimize the use of limited security resources. To that end, we founded the \"security games\" framework to build decision-aids for security agencies. Security games is a novel area of research that is based on computational and behavioral game theory, while also incorporating elements of AI planning under uncertainty and machine learning. We have deployed securitygames based decision aids for infrastructure security such as at the ports and ferry trafﬁc with the US coast guard (in the ports of New York, Boston, Los Angeles/Long Beach, Houston and others), for security of airports and air trafﬁc with the US Federal Air Marshals and the Los Angeles World Airport (LAX) police, and tested this framework for security of metro trains with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department. Moreover, recent work on \"green security games\" has led to testing our decision aids for protection of ﬁsheries with the US Coast Guard and protection of wildlife at sites in multiple countries, and opportunistic crime security games have focused on suppressing urban crime. This chapter will discuss applications of security games, and outline research challenges in security games including algorithms for scaling up security games as well as for handling signiﬁcant adversarial uncertainty and learning models of human adversary behaviors.",

As the number of players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase their ﬁnal rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to ﬁnd a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov Games. In this paper, we introduce a new deﬁnition of ǫ-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy’s quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellmanlike residuals implies to learn such an ǫ-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the Lp norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium in generic multiplayer generalsum turn-based MGs.",

      "abstract": "Bibliometric methods are used in multiple ﬁelds for a variety of purposes, namely for research evaluation. Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier’s Scopus. The objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some ﬁeld, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. To do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in WoS (13,605 journals) and Scopus (20,346 journals) with Ulrich’s extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. These results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, WoS and Scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different ﬁelds, institutions, countries or languages. The bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientiﬁc output that are not covered in WoS or Scopus, such as ﬁeld-speciﬁc and national citation indexes.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we build on the concept of a repeated game discussed in Chap. Repeated Games and introduce the notion of a multistage game. In both types of games, several antagonistic agents interact with each other over time. The difference is that, in a multistage game, there is a dynamic system whose state keeps changing: the controls chosen by the agents in the current period affect the system’s future. In contrast with repeated games, the agents’ payoffs in multistage games depend directly on the state of this system. Examples of such settings range from a microeconomic dynamic model of a ﬁsh biomass exploited by several agents to a macroeconomic interaction between the government and the business sector. In some multistage games, physically different decisionmakers engage in simultaneous-move competition. In others, agents execute their actions sequentially rather than simultaneously. We also study hierarchical games, where a leader moves ahead of a follower. This chapter concludes with an example of memory-based strategies that can support Pareto-efﬁcient outcomes.",

Based on a sample of 146 senior academics in ﬁve broad disciplinary areas, we therefore provide both a longitudinal and a cross-disciplinary comparison of the three databases. Our longitudinal comparison of eight data points between 2013 and 2015 shows a consistent and reasonably stable quarterly growth for both publications and citations across the three databases. This suggests that all three databases provide sufﬁcient stability of coverage to be used for more detailed cross-disciplinary comparisons. Our cross-disciplinary comparison of the three databases includes four key research metrics (publications, citations, h-index, and hI, annual, an annualised individual h-index) and ﬁve major disciplines (Humanities, Social Sciences, Engineering, Sciences and Life Sciences). We show that both the data source and the speciﬁc metrics used change the conclusions that can be drawn from cross-disciplinary comparisons.",

      "abstract": "The assumption of game theory is that the players in game must be rational. In the game of incomplete information, participants are not completely clear about the game. Therefore, usually there is a probability distribution of strategy selection in game. It is very complicated to know the real game information of the social and economic problems. In fact, the actual situation for many problems is that game players are irrational, or the probability distribution of game players’ strategies cannot be gotten, even the strategy sets are not complete (infinite strategy sets).There are many limitations in application of the traditional game theory. In this paper, the concept of complex information game and its Nash equilibrium are presented. It is proved that the complex information game problem can be solved by artificial neural network. An example on how to solve the complex information game problem with artificial neural network is given as well. Researchers hope that more and more scholars can use artificial intelligence theory to analyze the game theory problem. Therefore, the complex information game problems can be dealt more efficiently."

      "abstract": "Frequency estimation from discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefﬁcients of a rectangular windowed signal under the inﬂuence of additive white noise is a well studied problem in signal processing. In its simplest form, the process involves ﬁnding the spectral peaks. When higher frequency resolution is required, a frequency offset can be found from the interpolation of DFT coefﬁcients. However, most of the past researches focus on monotonic cisoid signals. In practical situations where multiple harmonics are present, the sidelobes from other harmonics interfere with the estimation of the harmonic being considered. In this case, windows with smaller sidelobes such as Hanning window are preferred over rectangular window. Given the increased mathematical complexity of Hanning window, analytical solution has not yet been available for DFT interpolation. In this paper, we derive an exact analytical solution of the estimated frequency from DFT interpolation of Hanning windowed signal. In experiments, we show that the new analytical solution is accurate for monotonic cisoid signal and can considerably reduce the effect of interharmonic interference as compared to previous rectangular windowed methods.",

      "abstract": "Fourier transform methods are used to analyze functions and data sets to provide frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of underlying oscillatory components. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods oﬀer speed advantages over evaluation of explicit integrals (EI) that deﬁne Fourier transforms. This paper compares frequency, amplitude, and phase accuracy of the two methods for well resolved peaks over a wide array of data sets including cosine series with and without random noise and a variety of physical data sets, including atmospheric CO2 concentrations, tides, temperatures, sound waveforms, and atomic spectra. The FFT uses MIT’s FFTW3 library. The EI method uses the rectangle method to compute the areas under the curve via complex math. Results support the hypothesis that EI methods are more accurate than FFT methods. Errors range from 5 to 10 times higher when determining peak frequency by FFT, 1.4 to 60 times higher for peak amplitude, and 6 to 10 times higher for phase under a peak. The ability to compute more accurate Fourier transforms has promise for improved data analysis in many ﬁelds, including more sensitive assessment of hypotheses in the environmental sciences related to CO2 concentrations and temperature. Other methods are available to address diﬀerent weaknesses in FFTs; however, the EI method always produces the most accurate output possible for a given data set. On the 2011 Lenovo ThinkPad used in this study, an EI transform on a 10,000 point data set took 31 seconds to complete. Source code (C) and Windows executable for the EI method are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/.",

We show that the use of non-linear models provides a better ﬁt to the data. We use these estimated decay rates to parameterise the characteristic decay response (decay rates along frequencies) of the piano under investigation.

      "abstract": "In this paper an analysis of the presence and possibilities of altmetrics for bibliometric and performance analysis is carried out. Using the web based tool Impact Story, we collected metrics for 20,000 random publications from the Web of Science. We studied both the presence and distribution of altmetrics in the set of publications, across ﬁelds, document types and over publication years, as well as the extent to which altmetrics correlate with citation indicators. The main result of the study is that the altmetrics source that provides the most metrics is Mendeley, with metrics on readerships for 62.6 /////// % of all the publications studied, other sources only provide marginal information. In terms of relation with citations, a moderate spearman correlation (r = 0.49) has been found between Mendeley readership counts and citation indicators. Other possibilities and limitations of these indicators are discussed and future research lines are outlined.",

The train- ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D; a unique solution exists; with G recovering the training data distribution andD equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G andD are defined by multilayer perceptrons; the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. 1",

      "abstract": "Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) are prominent citation services with distinct indexing mechanisms. Comprehensive knowledge about the growth patterns of these two citation services is lacking. We analyzed the development of citation counts in WoS and GS for two classic articles and 56 articles from diverse research ﬁelds, making a distinction between retroactive growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in mid-2005 and citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013) and actual growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013 and citation counts up to April 2013 measured in April 2013). One of the classic articles was used for a citation-by-citation analysis. Results showed that GS has substantially grown in a retroactive manner (median of 170 /////// % across articles), especially for articles that initially had low citations counts in GS as compared to WoS. Retroactive growth of WoS was small, with a median of 2 /////// % across articles. Actual growth percentages were moderately higher for GS than for WoS (medians of 54 vs. 41 /////// %). The citation-by-citation analysis showed that the percentage of citations being unique in WoS was lower for more recent citations (6.8 /////// % for citations from 1995 and later vs. 41 /////// % for citations from before 1995), whereas the opposite was noted for GS (57 vs. 33 /////// %). It is concluded that, since its inception, GS has shown substantial expansion, and that the majority of recent works indexed in WoS are now also retrievable via GS. A discussion is provided on quantity versus quality of citations, threats for WoS, weaknesses of GS, and implications for literature research and research evaluation."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is the time domain modeling of a piano. We aim at explaining the vibratory and acoustical behavior of the piano, by taking into account the main elements that contribute to sound production. The soundboard is modeled as a bidimensional thick, orthotropic, heterogeneous, frequency dependant damped plate, using Reissner Mindlin equations. The vibroacoustics equations allow the soundboard to radiate into the surrounding air, in which we wish to compute the complete acoustical ﬁeld around the perfectly rigid rim. The soundboard is also coupled to the strings at the bridge, where they form a slight angle from the horizontal plane. Each string is modeled by a one dimensional damped system of equations, taking into account not only the transversal waves excited by the hammer, but also the stiﬀness thanks to shear waves, as well as the longitudinal waves arising from geometric nonlinearities. The hammer is given an initial velocity that projects it towards a choir of strings, before being repelled. The interacting force is a nonlinear function of the hammer compression. The ﬁnal piano model is a coupled system of partial diﬀerential equations, each of them exhibiting speciﬁc diﬃculties (nonlinear nature of the string system of equations, frequency dependant damping of the soundboard, great number of unknowns required for the acoustic propagation), in addition to couplings’ inherent diﬃculties.",

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientiﬁc papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag \"good for teaching\" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag – if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is speciﬁcally scientiﬁcally oriented (\"new ﬁnding\"). The ﬁndings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact.",

      "abstract": "Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.",

      "abstract": "Humans and animals face decision tasks in an uncertain multi-agent environment where an agent’s strategy may change in time due to the co-adaptation of others strategies. The neuronal substrate and the computational algorithms underlying such adaptive decision making, however, is largely unknown. We propose a population coding model of spiking neurons with a policy gradient procedure that successfully acquires optimal strategies for classical game-theoretical tasks. The suggested population reinforcement learning reproduces data from human behavioral experiments for the blackjack and the inspector game. It performs optimally according to a pure (deterministic) and mixed (stochastic) Nash equilibrium, respectively. In contrast, temporal-difference(TD)-learning, covariance-learning, and basic reinforcement learning fail to perform optimally for the stochastic strategy. Spike-based population reinforcement learning, shown to follow the stochastic reward gradient, is therefore a viable candidate to explain automated decision learning of a Nash equilibrium in two-player games.",

      "abstract": "The main result of this thesis is an eﬀective method to extend Karr’s symbolic summation framework to algebraic extensions. These arise, for example, when working with expressions involving (−1)n. An implementation of this method, including a modernised version of Karr’s algorithm is also presented. Karr’s algorithm is the summation analogue of the Risch algorithm for indeﬁnite integration. In the summation case, towers of specialized diﬀerence ﬁelds called ΠΣ-ﬁelds are used to model nested sums and products. This is similar to the way elementary functions involving nested logarithms and exponentials are represented in diﬀerential ﬁelds in the integration case. In contrast to the integration framework, only transcendental extensions are allowed in Karr’s construction. Algebraic extensions of ΠΣ-ﬁelds can even be rings with zero divisors. Karr’s methods rely heavily on the ability to solve ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerence equations and they are no longer applicable over these rings. Based on Bronstein’s formulation of a method used by Singer for the solution of diﬀerential equations over algebraic extensions, we transform a ﬁrst-order linear equation over an algebraic extension to a system of ﬁrst-order equations over a purely transcendental extension ﬁeld. However, this domain is not necessarily a ΠΣ-ﬁeld. Using a structure theorem by Singer and van der Put, we reduce this system to a single ﬁrst-order equation over a ΠΣ-ﬁeld, which can be solved by Karr’s algorithm. We also describe how to construct towers of diﬀerence ring extensions on an algebraic extension, where the same reduction methods can be used. A common bottleneck for symbolic summation algorithms is the computation of nullspaces of matrices over rational function ﬁelds. We present a fast algorithm for matrices over Q(x) which uses fast arithmetic at the hardware level with calls to BLAS subroutines after modular reduction. This part is joint work with Arne Storjohann.",

      "abstract": "In this work the effect of two different bridge conﬁgurations on the vibrations of the top plate of a classical guitar is presented. Experimental harmonic analysis and visualization techniques, in addition to detailed damped simulations using the ﬁnite element method, were used to obtain mobility functions and operating deﬂection shapes of a top plate. The mobility functions were obtained in the following sequence. First the mobility functions were obtained on the top plate without a bridge attached. Then a bridge was glued to the top plate and new measurements were made. Finally the already attached bridge was cross-cut in situ without detaching it from the top plate, and the measurements were repeated. Those speciﬁc designs were chosen on the grounds of simplicity of construction both experimentally and in FEM simulations (no particular preference for those designs is implied). The assembly and the speciﬁc design of the bridge have shown to have considerable inﬂuence on the response of the top plate regarding the mode shapes above 300 Hz. Depending on the geometry of the bridge, its deﬂections can either be comparable to the maximum deﬂections of the top plate or can have amplitudes so small that the bridge effectively creates a nodal zone on the plate vibrations. This suggests that the shape, the stiffness, and the mass properties of the bridge may play a role in the sound quality of the instrument. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Existing research suggests learning to …nd a Nash equilibrium in a new game is too di¢ cult a task for a neural network, but says little about what it will do instead. We observe that a neural network trained to …nd Nash equilibria in a known subset of games, will use self-taught rules developed endogenously when facing new games. These rules are close to payo¤ dominance and its best response. Our …ndings are consistent with existing experimental results, both in terms of subject’s methodology and success rates.",

      "abstract": "Background: Researchers turn to citation tracking to find the most influential articles for a particular topic and to see how often their own published papers are cited. For years researchers looking for this type of information had only one resource to consult: the Web of Science from Thomson Scientific. In 2004 two competitors emerged – Scopus from Elsevier and Google Scholar from Google. The research reported here uses citation analysis in an observational study examining these three databases; comparing citation counts for articles from two disciplines (oncology and condensed matter physics) and two years (1993 and 2003) to test the hypothesis that the different scholarly publication coverage provided by the three search tools will lead to different citation counts from each. Methods: Eleven journal titles with varying impact factors were selected from each discipline (oncology and condensed matter physics) using the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). All articles published in the selected titles were retrieved for the years 1993 and 2003, and a stratified random sample of articles was chosen, resulting in four sets of articles. During the week of November 7–12, 2005, the citation counts for each research article were extracted from the three sources. The actual citing references for a subset of the articles published in 2003 were also gathered from each of the three sources. Results: For oncology 1993 Web of Science returned the highest average number of citations, 45.3. Scopus returned the highest average number of citations (8.9) for oncology 2003. Web of Science returned the highest number of citations for condensed matter physics 1993 and 2003 (22.5 and 3.9 respectively). The data showed a significant difference in the mean citation rates between all pairs of resources except between Google Scholar and Scopus for condensed matter physics 2003. For articles published in 2003 Google Scholar returned the largest amount of unique citing material for oncology and Web of Science returned the most for condensed matter physics. Conclusion: This study did not identify any one of these three resources as the answer to all citation tracking needs. Scopus showed strength in providing citing literature for current (2003) oncology articles, while Web of Science produced more citing material for 2003 and 1993 condensed matter physics, and 1993 oncology articles. All three tools returned some unique material. Our data indicate that the question of which tool provides the most complete set of citing literature may depend on the subject and publication year of a given article."

In this paper, we apply this issue to a search-theoretic framework (posted-price market) where sellers are confronted with a population of imperfectly informed buyers and take one decision per period (posted prices) with no direct interactions between sellers. We focus on three different scenarios with varying buyers’ characteristics. For each of these scenarios, we quantitatively and qualitatively test whether the learned variable (price strategy) converges to the Nash equilibrium. We also study the impact of the temperature parameter (deﬁning the exploitation/exploration trade off) on these results.",

Using numerical analysis we show that it performs strictly better than the tit-for-tat algorithm and many other adaptive and non-adaptive strategies. Second, we study the same problem from the aspect of zero-sum games. We discuss how AI and Machine Learning techniques work closely to give our agent a ’mind-reading’ capability.",

      "abstract": "Multiagent learning is a key problem in AI. In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-conﬂicting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the ﬁrst algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm’s parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.",

First we formulate theoretically a unified way of constructing physical interaction models which include elements that use both wave variables and Kirchhoff variables. These elements can be applied to build 1-D and multidimensional structures as well as lumped element models. In addition, typical signal processing algorithms are supported. A software environment (Block Compiler) has been developed, allowing for high-level object-based specification of physical models and their compilation to efficient code for execution.",

The results of all these measurements show that high frequency vibrations and radiation occurs signiﬁcantly from 1 to 14 kHz, but that the sound radiation has harmonics at frequencies up to 20 kHz. This report does not produce any experimental evidence as to the importance of the high frequency region from the subjective point of view, or to the correlation of the subjective impression of reverberation of the plates with measured data of early decay times, as these aspects were not addressed at this point.",

      "abstract": "Functional polynomials composed of sinusoidal functions are introduced as basis functions to construct an interpolatory spline. An interpolant constructed in this way does not require solving a system of linear equations as many approaches do. However there are vanishing tangent vectors at the interpolating points. By blending with a Bezier curve using the data points as the control points, the blended curve is a proper smooth interpolant. The blending factor has the effect similar to the \"tension\" control of tension splines. Piecewise interpolants can be constructed in an analogous way as a connection of Bezier curve segments to achieve C 1 continuity at the connecting points. Smooth interpolating surface patches can also be defined by blending sinusoidal polynomial tensor surfaces and Bezier tensor surfaces. The interpolant can very efficiently be evaluated by tabulating the sinusoidal function.",

The resulting instruments exhibit interesting natural vibration mode and sound radiation physics. The tone qualities of the new instruments suggest relations between the guitar response envelope and human sound perception. Translating the principle natural modes of the guitar up or down with string frequencies does not necessarily produce pleasing tone qualities nor optimal playing dynamics. However, designing bracing configurations for both classical and folk baritone and bass guitars to maximise low frequency radiation eficiency does seem to produce new instruments of musical appeal, Frequency response records of standard and guitar family variants illustrate the physical behaviour of the difierent designs. Experience of musicians with the guitar family instruments indicates that creative new guitar territory is available.",

It is shown here how their numerical approach and the underlying physical model can be improved in order to simulate the motion of the piano string with a high d e g e e of realism. Starting from the fundamental equations of a damped, stlff string interacting with a nonlinear hammer, a numericalfinite difference scheme is derived,from which the time and spatial dependence of string displacement, velocity, and interactingforce between hammer and string, as well as theforce acting on the bridge, are computed in the time-domain. The strength of the model is illustrated by comparisons between measured and simulated piano tones. After this verification of the accuracy of the method, the model is used as a tool for systematically exploring the influence of string stiffness, relative strikin, position, and hammer-string mass ratio on string waveforms and spectra.",

      "abstract": "Two algorithms are presented for smoothing arbitrary sets of data. They are the explicit variable algorithm and the parametric variable algorithm. The former would be used where large gradients are not encountered because of the smaller amount of calculation required. The latter would be used if the data being smoothed were double valued or experienced large gradients. Both algorithms use a least-squares technique to obtain a cubic spline fit to the data. The advantage of the spline fit is that the first and second derivatives are continuous. This method is best used in an interactive graphics environment so that the junction values for the spline curve can be manipulated to improve the fit.",
