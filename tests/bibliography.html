  {key: `year_zappi_etal`,type: `article`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,author: `Victor Zappi and Andrew Allen and Sidney Fels`,abstract: `Physical modelling is a sophisticated synthesis technique, often used in the design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Diﬀerence TimeDomain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of oﬀ-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a ﬁrst interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.`,langid: `english`,pages: `6`,title: `Shader-based Physical Modelling for the Design of Massive Digital Musical Instruments`,tags: `tesse`},

In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-conﬂicting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the ﬁrst algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm's parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.`,journal: `Advances in neural information processing systems`,keywords: `game theory`,pages: `1603--1610`,title: `Reinforcement learning to play an optimal Nash equilibrium in team Markov games`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Game Theory/2003 Reinforcement Learning to Play an Optimal Nash Equilibrium in Team Markov Games  2003WangReinforcement.pdf`,tags: `game theory`},

Thus, it has a higher mode density than the traditional kanteles.

Consequently, the modiﬁed kantele has a higher radiation eﬃciency than the traditional kanteles when the size of the air gap is small (1-3 mm).`,langid: `english`,pages: `73`,title: `Modelling body vibration and sound radiation of a modiﬁed kantele`},

  {key: `year_spiliopoulos`,type: `article`,author: `Leonidas Spiliopoulos`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `This paper addresses the question of whether neural networks (NNs), a realistic cognitive model of human information processing, can learn to backward induce in a two-stage game with a unique subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. The NNs were found to predict the Nash equilibrium approximately 70 ///% of the time in new games. Similarly to humans, the neural network agents are also found to suffer from subgame and truncation inconsistency, supporting the contention that they are appropriate models of general learning in humans. The agents were found to behave in a bounded rational manner as a result of the endogenous emergence of decision heuristics. In particular a very simple heuristic socialmax, that chooses the cell with the highest social payoff explains their behavior approximately 60 ///% of the time, whereas the ownmax heuristic that simply chooses the cell with the maximum payoff for that agent fares worse explaining behavior roughly 38 ///%, albeit still signiﬁcantly better than chance. These two heuristics were found to be ecologically valid for the backward induction problem as they predicted the Nash equilibrium in 67 ///% and 50 ///% of the games respectively. Compared to various standard classiﬁcation algorithms, the NNs were found to be only slightly more accurate than standard discriminant analyses. However, the latter do not model the dynamic learning process and have an ad hoc postulated functional form. In contrast, a NN agent’s behavior evolves with experience and is capable of taking on any functional form according to the universal approximation theorem.`,langid: `english`,pages: `10`,title: `Learning backward induction: a neural network agent approach`,tags: `tesse`},

The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language model. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony or the number or type of instruments. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and compare their performance to two popular state-of-the-art acoustic models. We also present an efﬁcient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate the model’s performance on the MAPS dataset and show that the proposed model outperforms state-ofthe-art transcription systems.`,langid: `english`,pages: `14`,title: `An End-to-End Neural Network for Polyphonic Music Transcription`},

Although the causative role of the paraproteinaemia is supposed, the pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown. We report a 65-year-old woman with a 28-year history of disseminated indurated plaques involving her face, trunk and extremities. Since 1994 an IgG kappa paraproteinaemia was present. Current biopsies showed typical histological features of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. We treated this extraordinary widespread condition with melphalan and prednisolone. Although the serum levels of IgG kappa light chains and gamma globulins decreased, the cutaneous plaques extended rapidly in size and number, which casts doubt on the causative significance of the paraproteinaemia in the pathogenesis of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. The paraproteinaemia in patients with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma may rather reflect a secondary phenomenon than the originating cause.

Using citations to the work of 25 library and information science faculty members as a case study, this paper examines the effects of using Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) on the citation counts and rankings of scholars as measured by WoS. Overall, more than 10,000 citing and purportedly citing documents were examined. Results show that Scopus significantly alters the relative ranking of those scholars that appear in the middle of the rankings and that GS stands out in its coverage of conference proceedings as well as international, non-English language journals. The use of Scopus and GS, in addition to WoS, helps reveal a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the scholarly impact of authors.

Our general approach is based on measuring the directivity of an acoustic violin, and designing a digital filter structure that mimics the observed directivity while allowing interactive operation. The digital filter structure is fed by the electrical signal coming from a silent electric violin as played by a musician. In a hemi-anechoic chamber, we use a microphone array to characterize the frequency-dependent directivity transfer function of a real violin by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the acoustic pressure at 4320 points on a sphere surrounding the instrument. From the input force and output pressure signals obtained from the real violin measurements, we use deconvolution to estimate 4320 impulse responses each corresponding to a radiation direction. With such impulse responses, we use State Wave Synthesis to model the observed directivity in time-varying conditions and efficiently render directional wavefronts in a virtual environment. We characterize the silent violin transfer function by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the electrical signal at its output, leading to an impulse response that we use to design an inverse filter to recover the force excitation at the bridge.`,keywords: `Directivity,Electric Violin,Radiation,Replica,Silent Violin,Violin,Virtual`,pages: `7`,title: `Creating virtual acoustic replicas of real violins`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/2019 Creating Virtual Acoustic Replicas of Real Violins - Maestre and Scavone.pdf`},

The most common technique for this is called Word2Vec, but I’ll show you how recurrent neural networks can also be used for creating word vectors.In the section after, we’ll look at the very popular LSTM, or long short-term memory unit, and the more modern and efficient GRU, or gated recurrent unit, which has been proven to yield comparable performance.We’ll apply these to some more practical problems, such as learning a language model from Wikipedia data and visualizing the word embeddings we get as a result.All of the materials required for this course can be downloaded and installed for FREE. We will do most of our work in Numpy, Matplotlib, and Theano.

The search space of Go is much larger than that of chess, meaning that existing techniques for playing games with artificial intelligence were infeasible. Deep learning was the technique that enabled AlphaGo to correctly predict the outcome of its moves and defeat the world champion.Deep learning progress has accelerated in recent years due to more processing power (see: Tensor Processing Unit or TPU), larger datasets, and new algorithms like the ones discussed in this book.`,pagetotal: `56`,shorttitle: `Deep Learning`,title: `Deep Learning: Recurrent Neural Networks in Python: LSTM, GRU, and more RNN machine learning architectures in Python and Theano`,tags: `#merged`},

Several CRMs and real geological samples were digested using HF, HNO3 and HClO4 in closed vessels prior to sequential chemical purifications and then Sr isotopic ratios were determined by MC-ICP-MS or TIMS. Because HREEs reside in the Sr fraction when common cation-exhange resin is used, this purification technique is unsuitable prior to MC-ICP-MS analysis, as doubly loaded HREE interfere on Sr masses. We observe an obviously positive relationship between the radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratio and the content of HREEs in the Sr fractions, as well as a negative relationship between un-radiogenic 84Sr/86Sr or 84Sr/88Sr ratios and the content of HREEs in the Sr fractions during MC-ICP-MS Sr isotopic measurement. Such effects are insignificant for TIMS measurement, because ionization temperatures are generally lower and can be well controlled during the analyses. In contrast to the traditional Sr purification method (cation exchange resin), Sr-specific extraction chromatographic resin produces high purity Sr fractions, making it feasible for both MC-ICP-MS and TIMS.`,isbn: `9780471794110`,journal: `Production`,title: `DUMmIES 2`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Music/2006 Drums for Dummies - Jeff Strong.pdf`},

  {key: `year_hu_etal`,type: `article`,translator: ` `,author: `Junling Hu and Michael P Wellman`,editor: ` `,abstract: `We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of generalsum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (deﬁned by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the ﬁrst grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of ofﬂine learning performance in both games, we ﬁnd agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.`,pages: `31`,title: `Nash Q-Learning for General-Sum Stochastic Games`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Game Theory/Nash Q-Learning for General-Sum Stochastic Games - Hu and Wellman.pdf`,tags: `game theory,#merged,tesse`},

  {key: `year_erkut_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Cumhur Erkut and Matti Karjalainen`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `The one-dimensional digital waveguides, combined with the commuted synthesis method, allow modeling and high-quality synthesis of plucked string instrument tones in a very eﬃcient manner. However, the increasing computational power of the modern processors makes it feasible to experiment with more complex algorithms also for real-time sound synthesis purposes. By certain simpliﬁcations, time-domain methods based on ﬁnite diﬀerences (FDTD) are eﬃcient enough to run in real time on modern processors and yet they are more ﬂexible than the computationally less expensive commuted synthesis. The resulting structures, which are called 1-D FDTD waveguides, have previously been shown to be equal to or to approximate many properties of digital waveguides, including lossless and lossy propagation, input and output ports, terminations, and scattering junctions. The numerical stability of the 1-D FDTD waveguides, as well as their initialization and formation of the traveling waves are well understood. However, a careful comparison between 1-D FDTD waveguides and conventional digital waveguides in terms of their limitations, computational eﬃciency, accuracy, and interaction has not been carried out. The aim of this paper is to ﬁll this gap by highlighting important properties of both methods side by side in string instrument modeling and synthesis. We then try to combine the best properties of both methods and discuss the interaction of the two model structures. Synthetic tones and short musical phrases obtained by both synthesis models will be demonstrated during the presentation. These sound examples will also be available at http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/demos/.`,langid: `english`,pages: `8`,title: `Finite difference method vs. digital waveguide method in string instrument modeling and synthesis`},

Items are placed in the knapsack sequentially, and the act of placing an item in the knapsack instantiates its size. Our goal is to compute a solution "policy" that maximizes the expected value of items placed in the knapsack, and we consider both non-adaptive policies (that designate a priori a ﬁxed sequence of items to insert) and adaptive policies (that can make dynamic choices based on the instantiated sizes of items placed in the knapsack thus far). We show that adaptivity provides only a constant-factor improvement by demonstrating a greedy non-adaptive algorithm that approximates the optimal adaptive policy within a factor of 7. We also design an adaptive polynomial-time algorithm which approximates the optimal adaptive policy within a factor of 5 + , for any constant > 0.`,langid: `english`,pages: `10`,title: `Approximating the Stochastic Knapsack Problem: The Beneﬁt of Adaptivity`,tags: `tesse`},

The central problem is how to evaluate a set of alternatives in terms of a number of criteria. Although this problem is very relevant in practice, there are few methods available and their quality is hard to determine. Thus, the question Which is the best method for a given problem?' has become one of the most important and challenging ones. This is exactly what this book has as its focus and why it is important. The author extensively compares, both theoretically and empirically, real-life MCDM issues and makes the reader aware of quite a number of surprising abnormalities' with some of these methods. What makes this book so valuable and different is that even though the analyses are rigorous, the results can be understood even by the non-specialist. Audience: Researchers, practitioners, and students; it can be used as a textbook for senior undergraduate or graduate courses in business and engineering.`,isbn: `9781441948380`,title: `A Comparative Study Applied Optimization`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis/2000 Multi-criteria Decision Making Methods - A Comparative Study - Triantaphyllou.pdf`},

  {key: `year_cost_etal`,type: `book`,author: ` Cost and Moheb I`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `The real story of how our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes―with or without "brain training."Fifty years ago, neuroscientists thought that a mature brain was fixed like a fly in amber, unable to change. Today, we know that our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes. This concept of neuroplasticity has captured the imagination of a public eager for self-improvement―and has inspired countless Internet entrepreneurs who peddle dubious "brain training" games and apps. In this book, Moheb Costandi offers a concise and engaging overview of neuroplasticity for the general reader, describing how our brains change continuously in response to our actions and experiences.Costandi discusses key experimental findings, and describes how our thinking about the brain has evolved over time. He explains how the brain changes during development, and the "synaptic pruning" that takes place before brain maturity. He shows that adult brains can grow new cells (citing, among many other studies, research showing that sexually mature male canaries learn a new song every year). He describes the kind of brain training that can bring about improvement in brain function. It's not gadgets and games that promise to "rewire your brain" but such sustained cognitive tasks as learning a musical instrument or a new language. (Costandi also notes that London cabbies increase their gray matter after rigorous training in their city's complicated streets.) He tells how brains compensate after stroke or injury; describes addiction and pain as maladaptive forms of neuroplasticity; and considers brain changes that accompany childhood, adolescence, parenthood, and aging. Each of our brains is custom-built. Neuroplasticity is at the heart of what makes us human.`,isbn: `9780262529334`,publisher: `The MIT Press`,title: `Neuroplasticity`},

Hello, Android has been updated to Android 2.3.3, with revised code throughout to reflect this updated version. That means that the book is now up-to-date for tablets such as the Kindle Fire. All examples were tested for forwards and backwards compatibility on a variety of devices and versions of Android from 1.5 to 4.0. (Note: the Kindle Fire does not support home screen widgets or wallpaper, so those samples couldn't be tested on the Fire.)Android is an operating system for mobile phones and tablets. It's inside millions of cell phones and other devices, including the hugely popular Amazon Kindle Fire, making Android the foremost platform for mobile application developers. That could be your own program running on all those devices.Within minutes, Hello, Android will get you started creating your first working application: Android's version of "Hello, World." From there, you'll build up a more substantial example: an Android Sudoku game. By gradually adding features to the game, you'll learn the basics of Android programming. You'll also see how to build in audio and video support, add graphics using 2D and 3D OpenGL, network with web pages and web services, and store data with SQLite. You'll also learn how to publish your applications to the Android Market.The /////////#1 book for learning Android is now in its third edition. Every page and example was reviewed and updated for compatibility with the latest versions. Freshly added material covers installing applications to the SD card, supporting multi-touch, and creating live wallpaper.

Whether you are a skeptic, a veteran astral projector, a newbie, or an armchair traveler, there's treasure here. It's in a class by itself. What he says here rings true. In fact, it does a lot more than ring true. It opens doors. Astral Dynamics provides the intelligent and motivated reader with everything needed to put theory into practice. The book's six parts may be read each on their own, but they have been placed to build nicely one upon the other. Part One, "Elements of Projection", presents Robert's theory of what actually goes on when the projectable astral double leaves the physical body. This in itself, right out of the gate, is fascinating terrain. His theory of the consequences of the mind-split that results from projection is itself worth the price of the book. Part Two, "NEW Energy Ways", presents his stunningly practical method of raising energy and awareness by using touch, which he calls Tactile Imaging. I have tried this method on half a dozen people, selected more or less at random, each of whom obtained the desired awareness within seconds! And then, as if the new method of visualization weren't enough, Robert proceeds to describe the nature and anatomy of our energy bodies, a description firmly rooted in his own personal explorations. Part Three, "Core Skills", builds on this foundation, demonstrating how to succeed at the three tasks that are essential to success in astral projection: deep physical relaxation, taming the mind, and attaining the trance state. Part Four, "Projection Exit and Technique", tells you what you need to know to stop reading about astral projection and actually do it. Part Five, "The Akashic Connection", proceeds into the realm of the theoretical, not for the sake of getting lost in theory, but in order to make sense of things seen and heard. Particularly interesting is Robert's description of the nature and meaning of what he calls the Akashic Pulse. As to his description and analysis of the astral planes, the silver cord, the etheric body, and the Akashic record — I doubt that these have been equaled anywhere in the subject's extensive modern literature. I am confident that they have not been excelled. Part Six, "Strange Astral Phenomena", takes on a few conundrums that are worth exploring. Projection into higher realms; reality fluctuations; astral noise; what Robert calls astral wildlife, and astral combat... he covers the turf as it hasn't been covered to date. And he does it so casually, in so unpretentious a manner, his mood ranging from deepest awe to casually joking, with all the range between. If you have any interest at all in the subject of astral projection, lucid dreaming — higher consciousness in general — you're going to love this book. I predict that it will become a classic, read and valued for many years to come.

We focus our study on the latter. Our model captures not only the temporal relations along time but the structure relations between keys. Experimental results show that our model has a better performance than baseline MusicVAE in capturing notes in a chord. Besides, our method accords with music theory since it maintains the configuration of the circle of fifths, distinguishes major and minor keys from interval vectors, and manifests meaningful structures between music phrases.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `2011.09078`,eprint: `2011.09078`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,title: `Vertical-horizontal structured attention for generating music with chords`,year: `2020`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Music/Vertical-Horizontal Structured Attention for Generating Music with Chords - Zhao et al..pdf`},

In the first step, the SWDFT sequence in frequency-domain varied with time instant is obtained by performing the SWDFT on the input signal, where the coarse frequency is estimated. It has been proved that the SWDFT of a multi-frequency signal possesses the same linear relationship as the original time-domain signal and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each frequency component is enhanced by the SWDFT. In the second step, the parameters are estimated with high accuracy by a linear prediction from the SWDFT sequence, where the complex-valued least squares (CLS) framework is used. Computer simulation and practical measurement results show that the proposed algorithm can estimate parameters of a multi-frequency signal distorted by noise with high accuracy.`,doi: `10.1016/j.dsp.2019.102617`,issn: `1051-2004`,journal: `Digital Signal Processing`,keywords: `Complex-valued least squares (CLS),Linear prediction,Multi-frequency signal,Parameter estimation,Sliding-window discrete Fourier transform (SWDFT)`,langid: `en`,pages: `102617`,publisher: `Elsevier BV`,title: `A sliding-window DFT based algorithm for parameter estimation of multi-frequency signal`,url: `https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S105120041930171X?httpAccept=text/xml`,volume: `97`,year: `2020`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2020 A sliding-window DFT based algorithm for parameter estimation of multi-frequency signal - Wang et al.pdf`,tags: `#retrieved`},

However, some studies conducted in Europe (Wogram), Japan (Suzuki) and the United States (Giordano) underlined a very weak correlation between sound radiation and modal analysis. This mismatch required further research. The acoustic parameter intensity of acoustic radiation (IAR) is highly related to the mechanical vibration of the sound source. IAR was able to quantify the sound efficiency of musical instruments, and to relate sound radiation with modal analysis. This paper investigates IAR measured on three Persian stringed musical Instruments, namely the thar, si-thar and santoor.

Envelope detection techniques have applications in areas like health, sound classification and synthesis, seismology and speech recognition. Nevertheless, a general method to digital envelope detection of signals with rich spectral content doesn't exist, as most methods involve manual intervention, in the form of filter design, smoothing, as well as other specific design choices, based on a priori knowledge about the nature of the specific waves under investigation. To address this problem, we propose a framework that uses intrinsic characteristics of a signal to estimate its envelope, completely eliminating the necessity of parameter tuning. The approach here described draws inspiration from geometric concepts to isolate the frontiers and thus estimate the temporal envelope of an arbitrary signal; to that end, alpha-shapes, concave hulls, and discrete curvature are explored. We also define entities, such as a pulse and frontiers, in the context of an arbitrary digital signal, as a means to reduce dimensionality and the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, a new measure of discrete curvature is used to obtain the average radius of curvature of a discrete wave, serving as a threshold to identify the wave's frontier points. We find the algorithm accurate in the identification of the frontiers of a wide range of digital sound waves with very diverse characteristics, while localizing each pseudo-cycle of the wave in the time domain. The algorithm also compares favourably with classic envelope detection techniques based on filtering and the Hilbert Transform.`,eprint: `2009.02860`,eprintclass: `cs.SD`,eprinttype: `arXiv`,keywords: `cs.SD, eess.AS, eess.SP`,title: `Robust Digital Envelope Estimation Via Geometric Properties of an Arbitrary Real Signal`,year: `2020`,tags: `representation`},

Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.`,issn: `2220-4806`,journal: `Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression`,number: `July`,pages: `484--490`,title: `What Makes a Good Musical Instrument?

Sophisticated branch-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithms for some of the most classical VRP variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a BCP solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of VRPs. It incorporates the key elements found in the best existing VRP algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, path enumeration, and rounded capacity cuts; all generalized through the new concepts of "packing set" and "elementarity set". The concepts are also used to derive a branching rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branching rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best specific algorithms. Even some non-VRPs, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.`,doi: `10.1007/s10107-020-01523-z`,isbn: `9783030179533`,issn: `0025-5610,1436-4646`,journal: `Mathematical Programming`,keywords: `Column generation,Integer programming,Routing`,langid: `en`,number: `1-2`,pages: `483--523`,publisher: `Springer Science and Business Media LLC`,title: `A generic exact solver for vehicle routing and related problems`,url: `http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-020-01523-z.pdf`,volume: `183`,year: `2020`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Linear Programming/2019 A Generic Exact Solver for Vehicle Routing and Related Problems.pdf`,tags: `#retrieved`},

In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two humans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as hesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate acoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and language context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only reach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%). Neural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have considerably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an integral fashion. However, processing such contexts requires an entire utterance presentation and thus introduces unwanted delays before a recognition result can be output. In this paper, we address performance as well as latency. We present results for a system that can achieve super-human performance (at a WER of 5.0%, over the Switchboard conversational benchmark) at a word based latency of only 1 second behind a speaker's speech.

IMR processes are meant to provide protection for patients whose doctors prescribe treatments that are denied by their health insurance (either private insurance or the insurance that is part of their worker comp; we focus on private insurance here). Laws requiring IMR were established in California and other states because patients and their doctors were concerned that health insurance plans deny coverage for medically necessary services. We analyze the text of the reviews and compare them closely with a sample of 50000 Yelp reviews [19] and the corpus of 50000 IMDB movie reviews [10]. Despite the fact that the IMDB corpus is twice as large as the IMR corpus, and the Yelp sample contains almost twice as many reviews, we can construct a very good language model for the IMR corpus using inductive sequential transfer learning, specifically ULMFiT [8], as measured by the quality of text generation, as well as low perplexity (11.86) and high categorical accuracy (0.53) on unseen test data, compared to the larger Yelp and IMDB corpora (perplexity: 40.3 and 37, respectively; accuracy: 0.29 and 0.39). We see similar trends in topic models [17] and classification models predicting binary IMR outcomes and binarized sentiment for Yelp and IMDB reviews. We also examine four other corpora (drug reviews [6], data science job postings [9], legal case summaries [5] and cooking recipes [11]) to show that the IMR results are not typical for specialized-register corpora. These results indicate that movie and restaurant reviews exhibit a much larger variety, more contentful discussion, and greater attention to detail compared to IMR reviews, which points to the possibility that a crucial consumer protection mandated by law fails a sizeable class of highly vulnerable patients.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1705.09864v1`,doi: `10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn`,eprint: `1705.09864v1`,issn: `16130073`,journal: `CEUR Workshop Proceedings`,keywords: `AI for social good,Language models,Sentiment classification,State-managed medical review processes,Topic models`,pages: `1--9`,title: `Textual evidence for the perfunctoriness of independent medical reviews`,volume: `2657`,year: `2020`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/binary nns/2017 BMXNet An Open-Source Binary Neural Network Implementation Based on MXNet.pdf`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1011.1669v3`,eprint: `1011.1669v3`,isbn: `9788578110796`,issn: `1098-6596`,journal: `Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling`,keywords: `icle`,number: `9`,pages: `1689--1699`,pmid: `25246403`,title: `済無No Title No Title`,volume: `53`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Management/1998 Strategy Safari_ A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Stratenagement - Henry Mintzberg & Bruce W.

In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the proposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D and 2D human poses in a type of 'free' self-supervision for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate 3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose projection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining geometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated 2D poses. Therefore, these two dual learning tasks enable our model to adaptively learn from 3D human pose data and external large-scale 2D human pose data. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop a 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship, temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our framework over all the compared competing methods.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1901.03798`,doi: `10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2892452`,eprint: `1901.03798`,issn: `0162-8828,2160-9292,1939-3539`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence`,keywords: `Human pose estimation,convolutional neural networks,geometric deep learning,self-supervised learning,spatio-temporal modeling`,number: `5`,pages: `1--1`,pmid: `30640601`,publisher: `Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)`,title: `3D Human Pose Machines with Self-supervised Learning`,url: `http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/34/4359286/08611195.pdf?arnumber=8611195`,volume: `42`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/2019 3D Human Pose Machines with Self-supervised Learning - Wang et al..pdf`,tags: `#retrieved`},

Here, we experimentally investigated whether the TAE of speech affects the perception of para-linguistic information, particularly urgency. We compared NVS in which the TAEs were identical to those of the original speech and NVS in which the TAEs had undergone low-pass or high-pass filtering. Urgency scales were derived from a paired comparison of the results and used to investigate the relationship between the temporal modulation components and urgency perception. Our findings were (1) the degree of urgency of the NVS stimuli was perceived as being similar to that of the original; (2) temporal modulation components of NVS upwards of 6 Hz were significant cues for urgency perception; and (3) temporal modulation components of NVS downwards of 8 Hz were significant cues for urgency perception.

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1906.02243`,doi: `10.18653/v1/p19-1355`,eprint: `1906.02243`,isbn: `9781950737482`,journal: `Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics`,number: `1`,pages: `3645--3650`,publisher: `Association for Computational Linguistics`,title: `Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/ANNs&Sustainability/2019 Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP.pdf`,tags: `#retrieved`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1011.1669v3`,eprint: `1011.1669v3`,isbn: `9788578110796`,issn: `1098-6596`,journal: `Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling`,keywords: `icle`,number: `9`,pages: `1689--1699`,pmid: `25246403`,title: `済無No Title No Title`,volume: `53`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Harmonic Analysis/2007 A First Course in Fourier Analysis - Kammler, David W.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

In this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by building a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure. To do so, we learn composable module operations which are able to either add or remove a particular ingredient. Each operator is designed as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Given only weak image-level supervision, the operators are trained to generate a visual layer that needs to be added to or removed from the existing image. The proposed model is able to decompose an image into an ordered sequence of layers by applying sequentially in the right order the corresponding removing modules. Experimental results on synthetic and real pizza images demonstrate that our proposed model is able to: (1) segment pizza toppings in a weakly-supervised fashion, (2) remove them by revealing what is occluded underneath them (i.e., inpainting), and (3) infer the ordering of the toppings without any depth ordering supervision.

In cymbal making, taper refers to the gradual change in thickness from the centre to the rim and is known to be a key feature that determines the tone of the instrument. It is generally used in conjunction with shape variations in order to enable the cymbal to play a bell-like sound when hit near its centre, or a crash sound when struck close to the edge. The von K/'arm/'an equations for thin plates with thickness and shape variations are derived, and a numerical method combining a Rayleigh-Ritz approach together with a St/"ormer-Verlet scheme for advancing the problem in time is detailed. One main advantage of the method is its ability to implement easily any frequency-dependent loss mechanism which is a key property for sound synthesis.

Then, an acoustic feature sequence of an arbitrary musical score is output in units of frames by the trained DNNs, and a natural trajectory of a singing voice is obtained by using a parameter generation algorithm. As singing voices contain rich expression, a powerful technique to model them accurately is required. In the proposed technique, long-term dependencies of singing voices are modeled by CNNs.

This paper describes the role of ENV and TFS information in pitch perception, binaural processing, and the perception of speech in the presence of background sounds. The paper also describes the effects of hearing loss and age on the processing of TFS and ENV information. The monaural and binaural processing of TFS information is adversely affected by both hearing loss and increasing age. The monaural processing of ENV information is little affected by hearing loss or by increasing age. The binaural processing of ENV information deteriorates somewhat with increasing age but is not markedly affected by hearing loss. The reduced TFS processing abilities found for older/hearing-impaired subjects may partially account for the difficulties that such subjects experience in complex listening situations.`,doi: `10.1250/ast.40.61`,issn: `13475177`,journal: `Acoustical Science and Technology`,keywords: `Age,Binaural processing,Hearing loss,Pitch,Sound localisation,Temporal envelope,Temporal fine structure`,number: `2`,pages: `61--83`,title: `The roles of temporal envelope and fine structure information in auditory perception`,volume: `40`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/unused/40_E192001.pdf`,tags: `temporal envelope`},

Emblematic of this feature is Bohr's 1913 proposal of quantum jumps between two discrete energy levels of an atom1. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement2–4. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Despite the non-deterministic character of quantum physics, is it possible to know if a quantum jump is about to occur? Here we answer this question affirmatively: we experimentally demonstrate that the jump from the ground state to an excited state of a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a predictable ‘flight', by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level coupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the evolution of each completed jump is continuous, coherent and deterministic. We exploit these features, using real-time monitoring and feedback, to catch and reverse quantum jumps mid-flight—thus deterministically preventing their completion. Our findings, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory5–9 and should provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as the early detection of error syndromes in quantum error correction.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1803.00545`,doi: `10.1038/s41586-019-1287-z`,eprint: `1803.00545`,issn: `14764687`,journal: `Nature`,number: `7760`,pages: `200--204`,pmid: `31160725`,title: `To catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight`,volume: `570`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/misc/2019 To catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight.pdf`},

Our general approach is based on measuring the directivity of an acoustic violin, and designing a digital ﬁlter structure that mimics the observed directivity while allowing interactive operation. The digital ﬁlter structure is fed by the electrical signal coming from a silent electric violin as played by a musician. In a hemi-anechoic chamber, we use a microphone array to characterize the frequency-dependent directivity transfer function of a real violin by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the acoustic pressure at 4320 points on a sphere surrounding the instrument. From the input force and output pressure signals obtained from the real violin measurements, we use deconvolution to estimate 4320 impulse responses each corresponding to a radiation direction. With such impulse responses, we use State Wave Synthesis to model the observed directivity in time-varying conditions and efﬁciently render directional wavefronts in a virtual environment. We characterize the silent violin transfer function by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the electrical signal at its output, leading to an impulse response that we use to design an inverse ﬁlter to recover the force excitation at the bridge.`,langid: `english`,pages: `7`,title: `Creating Virtual Acoustic Replicas of Real Violins`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/2019 Creating Virtual Acoustic Replicas of Real Violins - Maestre and Scavone.pdf`,tags: `digital musical instruments`},

However, the ADMM and its numerical variants (e.g., inexact, proximal or linearized) are awkward to obtain state-of-The-Art performance when dealing with complex learning and vision tasks due to their weak task-Adaption ability. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in incorporating task-specific computational modules (e.g., designed filters or learned architectures) into ADMM iterations. Unfortunately, these task-related modules introduce uncontrolled and unstable iterative flows, they also break the structures of the original optimization model. Therefore, existing theoretical investigations are invalid for these resulted task-specific iterations. In this paper, we develop a simple and generic proximal ADMM framework to incorporate flexible task-specific module for learning and vision problems. We rigorously prove the convergence both in objective function values and the constraint violation and provide the worst-case convergence rate measured by the iteration complexity. Our investigations not only develop new perspectives for analyzing task-Adaptive ADMM but also supply meaningful guidelines on designing practical optimization methods for real-world applications. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithmic framework.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1909.10819`,eprint: `1909.10819`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,keywords: `Computer vision.,Global convergence,Proximal ADMM,Task-Adapted optimization`,title: `On the convergence of ADMM with task adaption and beyond`,url: `https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQu7f-RZ`,year: `2019`,tags: `#merged`},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular.

Consequently, there is no up-to-date comparative information on the sizes of popular ASEBDs. This study aims to fill this blind spot by providing a comparative picture of 12 of the most commonly used ASEBDs. In doing so, we build on and refine previous scientometric research by counting query hit data as an indicator of the number of accessible records. Iterative query optimization makes it possible to identify a maximum number of hits for most ASEBDs. The results were validated in terms of their capacity to assess database size by comparing them with official information on database sizes or previous scientometric studies. The queries used here are replicable, so size information can be updated quickly.

The present study examined macroalgae-derived carbohydrates, as carbon sources for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) by Haloferax mediterranei. Simulants of the hydrolysates of seven different macroalgal biomasses were prepared and the PHA production was studied. A maximum biomass concentration with maximum PHA content was detected in medium prepared from green macroalgae. The highest cell dry weight and PHA concentrations were 3.8 ± 0.2 g/textperiodcenteredL −1 and 2.2 ± 0.12 g/textperiodcenteredL −1 respectively when Haloferax mediterranei was grown in 25% (w/w) of Ulva sp. hydrolysate, at 42 °C temperature and initial pH of 7.2.

Whenever such models are used for commercial applications, an additional constraint is the time to market, making automation of the sound design process desirable. In previous works, a computational sound design approach has been proposed for the parameter estimation problem involving timbre matching by deep learning, which was applied to the synthesis of pipe organ tones. In this paper, we refine previous results by introducing the former approach in a multi-stage algorithm that also adds heuristics and a stochastic optimization method operating on perceptually motivated objective cost functions. The optimization method shows to be able to refine the first estimate given by the deep learning approach and substantially improve the objective metrics, with the additional benefit of reducing the sound design process time. Subjective listening tests are also conducted to gather additional insights on the results.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1809.05483`,doi: `10.1109/TASLP.2019.2914530`,eprint: `1809.05483`,issn: `23299304`,journal: `IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing`,keywords: `Physics-based acoustic modeling,computational sound design,iterative optimization,neural networks`,number: `8`,pages: `1229--1240`,title: `A multi-stage algorithm for acoustic physical model parameters estimation`,volume: `27`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Physical Modeling/2019 A Multi-Stage Algorithm for Acoustic Physical Model Parameters Estimation - Gabrielli et al..pdf`},

We propose a novel method to edit talking-head video based on its transcript to produce a realistic output video in which the dialogue of the speaker has been modified, while maintaining a seamless audio-visual flow (i.e. no jump cuts). Our method automatically annotates an input talking-head video with phonemes, visemes, 3D face pose and geometry, reflectance, expression and scene illumination per frame. To edit a video, the user has to only edit the transcript, and an optimization strategy then chooses segments of the input corpus as base material. The annotated parameters corresponding to the selected segments are seamlessly stitched together and used to produce an intermediate video representation in which the lower half of the face is rendered with a parametric face model. Finally, a recurrent video generation network transforms this representation to a photorealistic video that matches the edited transcript. We demonstrate a large variety of edits, such as the addition, removal, and alteration of words, as well as convincing language translation and full sentence synthesis.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1906.01524`,eprint: `1906.01524`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,keywords: `Dubbing,Face parameterization,Face tracking,Neural rendering,Talking heads,Text-based video editing,Visemes`,number: `4`,title: `Text-based editing of talking-head video`,volume: `38`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2019 Text-based editing of talking-head video - Fried et al.pdf`},

  {key: `2019_cunningham_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Stuart Cunningham and Iain McGregor`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Audio data compression has revolutionised the way in which the music industry and musicians sell and distribute their products. Our previous research presented a novel codec named ACER (Audio Compression Exploiting Repetition), which achieves data reduction by exploiting irrelevancy and redundancy in musical structure whilst generally maintaining acceptable levels of noise and distortion in objective evaluations. However, previous work did not evaluate ACER using subjective listening tests, leaving a gap to demonstrate its applicability under human audio perception tests. In this paper, we present a double-blind listening test that was conducted with a range of listeners (N=100). The aim was to determine the efficacy of the ACER codec, in terms of perceptible noise and spatial distortion artefacts, against de facto standards for audio data compression and an uncompressed reference. Results show that participants reported no perceived differences between the uncompressed, MP3, AAC, ACER high quality, and ACER medium quality compressed audio in terms of noise and distortions but that the ACER low quality format was perceived as being of lower quality. However, in terms of participants' perceptions of the stereo field, all formats under test performed as well as each other, with no statistically significant differences. A qualitative, thematic analysis of listeners' feedback revealed that the noise artefacts that produced the ACER technique are different from those of comparator codecs, reflecting its novel approach. Results show that the quality of contemporary audio compression systems has reached a stage where their performance is perceived to be as good as uncompressed audio. The ACER format is able to compete as an alternative, with results showing a preference for the ACER medium quality versions over WAV, MP3, and AAC. The ACER process itself is viable on its own or in conjunction with techniques such as MP3 and AAC.`,doi: `10.1155/2019/8265301`,issn: `16877586`,journal: `International Journal of Digital Multimedia Broadcasting`,title: `Subjective Evaluation of Music Compressed with the ACER Codec Compared to AAC, MP3, and Uncompressed PCM`,volume: `2019`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/2019 Subjective Evaluation of Music Compressed with the ACER Codec Compared to AAC, MP3, and Uncompressed PCM - Cunningham and McGregor.pdf`},

Backpropagation, while highly effective on von Neumann architectures, becomes inefficient when scaling to large networks. Commonly referred to as the weight transport problem, each neuron's dependence on the weights and errors located deeper in the network require exhaustive data movement which presents a key problem in enhancing the performance and energy-efficiency of machine-learning hardware. In this work, we propose a bio-plausible alternative to backpropagation drawing from advances in feedback alignment algorithms in which the error computation at a single synapse reduces to the product of three scalar values. Using a sparse feedback matrix, we show that a neuron needs only a fraction of the information previously used by the feedback alignment algorithms. Consequently, memory and compute can be partitioned and distributed whichever way produces the most efficient forward pass so long as a single error can be delivered to each neuron. We evaluate our algorithm using standard datasets, including ImageNet, to address the concern of scaling to challenging problems. Our results show orders of magnitude improvement in data movement and 2× improvement in multiply-and-accumulate operations over backpropagation. Like previous work, we observe that any variant of feedback alignment suffers significant losses in classification accuracy on deep convolutional neural networks. By transferring trained convolutional layers and training the fully connected layers using direct feedback alignment, we demonstrate that direct feedback alignment can obtain results competitive with backpropagation. Furthermore, we observe that using an extremely sparse feedback matrix, rather than a dense one, results in a small accuracy drop while yielding hardware advantages.

They usually fall into one of two classes: strong but irreversible (e.g., superglues) or reversible/reusable but weak (e.g., pressure-sensitive adhesives and biological and biomimetic surfaces). Achieving both superstrong adhesion and reversibility has been challenging. This task is particularly difficult for hydrogels that, because their major constituent is liquid water, typically do not adhere strongly to any material. Here, we report a snail epiphragm-inspired adhesion mechanism where a polymer gel system demonstrates superglue-like adhesion strength (up to 892 N/textperiodcenteredcm−2) that is also reversible. It is applicable to both flat and rough target surfaces. In its hydrated state, the softened gel conformally adapts to the target surface by low-energy deformation, which is locked upon drying as the elastic modulus is raised from hundreds of kilopascals to ∼2.3 GPa, analogous to the action of the epiphragm of snails. We show that in this system adhesion strength is based on the material's intrinsic, especially near-surface, properties and not on any near-surface structure, providing reversibility and ease of scaling up for practical applications.`,doi: `10.1073/pnas.1818534116`,issn: `10916490`,journal: `Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America`,keywords: `Intrinsically reversible,Polymer gels,Shape adaptation,Snail epiphragm,Superstrong adhesion`,number: `28`,pages: `13774--13779`,pmid: `31209044`,title: `Intrinsically reversible superglues via shape adaptation inspired by snail epiphragm`,volume: `116`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/misc/2019 Intrinsically reversible superglues via shape adaptation inspired by snail epiphragm.pdf`},

We approach this problem as video-to-video translation using pose as an intermediate representation. To transfer the motion, we extract poses from the source subject and apply the learned pose-to-appearance mapping to generate the target subject. We predict two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results and introduce a separate pipeline for realistic face synthesis.

A spatial registrar of traffic infrastructure is currently a required component of local government councils' mandatory road management plans. Recent advancements of object detection technology in machine learning have presented an automated approach for the detection and classification of street signage captured by Google's Street View (GSV) imagery. This paper explores the possibility of using deep learning to produce an autonomous system for detecting traffic signs on GSV images to assist in traffic assets monitoring and maintenance. By leveraging Google's Street View API, this research offers an economic approach of building purposeful street sign computer vision datasets. A custom object detection model was trained to detect and classify Stop and Give Way signs from images captured at intersection approaches. Considering the output detected bounding box coordinates, photogrammetry approach was applied to calculate the approximate location of each detected sign in two-dimensional geographical space. The newly located and classified street signs can be combined with relevant spatial data for implementation into an asset management system. By combining GIS and the GSV API, the process is completely scalable to any level of street sign classification scope. The experiments conducted on the road network of study area recorded a detection accuracy of 95.63% and classification accuracy of 97.82%. Our proposed automated approach to the detection and localisation of street sign infrastructure has displayed a promising potential for its use by local government authorities. Our workflow can be used to detect other traffic signs and applied to other road sections and other cities. Of primary importance, this approach takes an entirely free and open-source approach throughout. The continuation of Google's Street View program will account for the spatiotemporal representation of street sign infrastructure for the ongoing maintenance and renewal programs of this valuable asset.`,doi: `10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101350`,issn: `01989715`,journal: `Computers, Environment and Urban Systems`,keywords: `Deep learning,GIS,Google street view (GSV) images,Object detection,Traffic asset management`,number: `May`,pages: `101350`,publisher: `Elsevier`,title: `Detecting and mapping traffic signs from Google Street View images using deep learning and GIS`,url: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101350`,volume: `77`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Deep Learning/2019 Detecting and mapping traffic signs from Google Street View images using deep learning and GIS - Campbell et al..pdf`},

This lack of understanding is linked to a lack of learning algorithms for recurrent networks of spiking neurons (RSNNs) that are both functionally powerful and can be implemented by known biological mechanisms. Since RSNNs are simultaneously a primary target for implementations of brain-inspired circuits in neuromorphic hardware, this lack of algorithmic insight also hinders technological progress in that area. The gold standard for learning in recurrent neural networks in machine learning is back-propagation through time (BPTT), which implements stochastic gradient descent with regard to a given loss function. But BPTT is unrealistic from a biological perspective, since it requires a transmission of error signals backwards in time and in space, i.e., from post- to presynaptic neurons. We show that an online merging of locally available information during a computation with suitable top-down learning signals in real-time provides highly capable approximations to BPTT. For tasks where information on errors arises only late during a network computation, we enrich locally available information through feedforward eligibility traces of synapses that can easily be computed in an online manner. The resulting new generation of learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks provides a new understanding of network learning in the brain that can be tested experimentally. In addition, these algorithms provide efficient methods for on-chip training of RSNNs in neuromorphic hardware. We changed in this version 2 of the paper the name of the new learning algorithms to e-prop, corrected minor errors, added details – especially for resulting new rules for synaptic plasticity, edited the notation, and included new results for TIMIT.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1901.09049`,eprint: `1901.09049`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,pages: `1--37`,title: `Biologically inspired alternatives to backpropagation through time for learning in recurrent neural nets`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2019 Biologically inspired alternatives to backpropagation through time for learning in recurrent neural nets.pdf`},

Brenner`,abstract: `The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is challenging because of the need to resolve spatiotemporal features over wide length- and timescales. Often, it is computationally intractable to resolve the finest features in the solution. The only recourse is to use approximate coarse-grained representations, which aim to accurately represent long-wavelength dynamics while properly accounting for unresolved small-scale physics. Deriving such coarse-grained equations is notoriously difficult and often ad hoc. Here we introduce data-driven discretization, a method for learning optimized approximations to PDEs based on actual solutions to the known underlying equations. Our approach uses neural networks to estimate spatial derivatives, which are optimized end to end to best satisfy the equations on a low-resolution grid. The resulting numerical methods are remarkably accurate, allowing us to integrate in time a collection of nonlinear equations in 1 spatial dimension at resolutions 4× to 8× coarser than is possible with standard finite-difference methods.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1808.04930`,doi: `10.1073/pnas.1814058116`,eprint: `1808.04930`,issn: `10916490`,journal: `Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America`,keywords: `Coarse graining,Computational physics,Machine learning`,number: `31`,pages: `15344--15349`,pmid: `31311866`,title: `Learning data-driven discretizations for partial differential equations`,volume: `116`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2019 Learning data-driven discretizations for partial differential equations - Bar-Sinai et al.pdf`},

Lane and Yarin Gal`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `Neural networks with deterministic binary weights using the Straight-Through-Estimator (STE) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results, but their training process is not well-founded. This is due to the discrepancy between the evaluated function in the forward path, and the weight updates in the back-propagation, updates which do not correspond to gradients of the forward path. Efficient convergence and accuracy of binary models often rely on careful fine-tuning and various ad-hoc techniques. In this work, we empirically identify and study the effectiveness of the various ad-hoc techniques commonly used in the literature, providing best-practices for efficient training of binary models. We show that adapting learning rates using second-moment methods is crucial for the successful use of the STE, and that other optimisers can easily get stuck in local minima. We also find that many of the commonly employed tricks are only effective towards the end of the training, with these methods making early stages of the training considerably slower. Our analysis disambiguates necessary from unnecessary ad-hoc techniques for the training of binary neural networks, paving the way for future development of solid theoretical foundations for these. Our newly-found insights further lead to new procedures which make training of existing binary neural networks notably faster.`,journal: `7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019`,number: `2016`,pages: `1--11`,title: `An empirical study of binary neural networks' optimisation`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/binary nns/2018 An Empirical study of Binary Neural Networks' Optimisation.pdf`},

From an acoustical point of view, the directivity of musical instruments is relevant both for the loudness and timbre of an instrument at a certain position in the audience, as well as for the spatial characteristics of the generated sound field. Musical instruments, however, are dynamic sound sources always moved by musicians as an element of their performance on stage. This work aims at assessing the acoustical effect and the perceptual relevance of these movements. For this purpose, we have recorded solo musical performances with all standard orchestral instruments with an optical motion tracking system, as well as the corresponding audio signals. The effect of the movements was evaluated by analysing the spectral fluctuation and the time-dependence of room acoustical parameters in a virtual acoustic environment in anechoic and reverberant conditions. In a subsequent listening test, an auralization of the static and dynamic musical performance was presented to listeners by binaural synthesis, showing that the signal-related fluctuations are clearly audible both in anechoic and reverberant situations. We discuss different approaches how to consider these effects for the simulation of natural acoustic sources in virtual acoustic reality.`,doi: `10.3813/AAA.919319`,issn: `18619959`,journal: `Acta Acustica united with Acustica`,number: `2`,pages: `356--367`,title: `the Acoustical Effect of Musicians' Movements During Musical Performances`,volume: `105`,year: `2019`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Musical/2019 The Acoustical Effect of Musicians' Movements During Musical Performances - Ackermann et al..pdf`},

In this paper, we propose to use the rate at which the Kirchhoff index changes with respect to the change of resistance of an edge as a measure of importance for this edge in weighted networks. For an arbitrary edge, we explicitly determine the change of the Kirchhoff index and express it in terms of the biharmonic distance between its end nodes, and thus call this centrality as biharmonic distance related centrality (BDRC). We show that BDRC has a better discriminating power than those commonly used metrics, such as edge betweenness and spanning edge centrality. We give an efficient algorithm that provides an approximation of biharmonic distance for all edges in nearly linear time of the number of edges, with a high probability.

Specifically, we show how an asymmetric bimatrix game (A,B) can be decomposed into its symmetric counterparts by envisioning and investigating the payoff tables (A and B) that constitute the asymmetric game, as two independent, single population, symmetric games. We reveal several surprising formal relationships between an asymmetric two-population game and its symmetric single population counterparts, which facilitate a convenient analysis of the original asymmetric game due to the dimensionality reduction of the decomposition. The main finding reveals that if (x,y) is a Nash equilibrium of an asymmetric game (A,B), this implies that y is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table A, and x is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table B. Also the reverse holds and combinations of Nash equilibria of the counterpart games form Nash equilibria of the asymmetric game. We illustrate how these formal relationships aid in identifying and analysing the Nash structure of asymmetric games, by examining the evolutionary dynamics of the simpler counterpart games in several canonical examples.`,doi: `10.1038/s41598-018-19194-4`,issn: `20452322`,journal: `Scientific Reports`,number: `1`,pages: `1015`,pmid: `29343692`,title: `Symmetric Decomposition of Asymmetric Games`,url: `http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19194-4`,volume: `8`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2018 Symmetric Decomposition of Asymmetric Games - Tuyls et al.pdf`,tags: `#corrupted author,#merged`},

Choosing a proper network architecture is a critical decision for a network's success, usually done in a manual manner. As a straightforward strategy, large, mostly fully connected architectures are selected, thereby relying on a good optimization strategy to find proper weights while at the same time avoiding overfitting. However, large parts of the final network are redundant. In the best case, large parts of the network become simply irrelevant for later inferencing. In the worst case, highly parameterized architectures hinder proper optimization and allow the easy creation of adverserial examples fooling the network. A first step in removing irrelevant architectural parts lies in identifying those parts, which requires measuring the contribution of individual components such as neuronS. In previous work, heuristics based on using the weight distribution of a neuron as contribution measure have shown some success, but do not provide a proper theoretical understanding. Therefore, in our work we investigate game theoretic measures, namely the shapley value (sV), in order to separate relevant from irrelevant parts of an artificial neural network. We begin by designing a coalitional game for an artificial neural network, where neurons form coalitions and the average contributions of neurons to coalitions yield to the shapley value. In order to measure how well the shapley value measures the contribution of individual neurons, we remove low-contributing neurons and measure its impact on the network performance. In our experiments we show that the shapley value outperforms other heuristics for measuring the contribution of neuronS.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1904.08166`,doi: `10.1016/j.procS.2018.07.257`,eprint: `1904.08166`,issn: `18770509`,journal: `Procedia Computer Science`,keywords: `Neural network pruning,Neural networks,Shapley value,Topology optimization`,pages: `234--243`,publisher: `Elsevier B.V.`,title: `Analysing Neural Network Topologies: A Game Theoretic Approach`,url: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2018.07.257`,volume: `126`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2018 Analysing Neural Network Topologies a Game Theoretic Approach - Stier et al..pdf`},

Bharath`,abstract: `Humans gain an implicit understanding of physical laws through observing and interacting with the world. Endowing an autonomous agent with an understanding of physical laws through experience and observation is seldom practical: we should seek alternatives. Fortunately, many of the laws of behaviour of the physical world can be derived from prior knowledge of dynamical systems, expressed through the use of partial differential equations. In this work, we suggest a neural network capable of understanding a specific physical phenomenon: wave propagation in a two-dimensional medium. We define "understanding" in this context as the ability to predict the future evolution of the spatial patterns of rendered wave amplitude from a relatively small set of initial observations. The inherent complexity of the wave equations – together with the existence of reflections and interference – makes the prediction problem non-trivial. A network capable of making approximate predictions also unlocks the opportunity to speed-up numerical simulations for wave propagation. To this aim, we created a novel dataset of simulated wave motion and built a predictive deep neural network comprising of three main blocks: an encoder, a propagator made by 3 LSTMs, and a decoder. Results show reasonable predictions for as long as 80 time steps into the future on a dataset not seen during training. Furthermore, the network is able to generalize to an initial condition that is qualitatively different from those seen during training1.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1812.01609`,eprint: `1812.01609`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,number: `Nips`,pages: `5--7`,title: `Approximating the solution to wave propagation using deep neural networks`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2018 Approximating the solution to wave propagation using deep neural networks.pdf`},

We accomplish the goal by applying the proposed Min-Max objective to a layer below the output layer of a CNN model in the course of training. The Min-Max objective explicitly ensures that the feature maps learned by a CNN model have the minimum within-manifold distance for each object manifold and the maximum between-manifold distances among different object manifolds. The Min-Max objective is general and able to be applied to different CNNs with insignificant increases in computation cost. Moreover, an incremental minibatch training procedure is also proposed in conjunction with the Min-Max objective to enable the handling of large-scale training data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on several benchmark data sets with both the image classification and face verification tasks reveal that employing the proposed Min-Max objective in the training process can remarkably improve performance accuracies of a CNN model in comparison with the same model trained without using this objective.`,doi: `10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2705682`,issn: `21622388`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems`,keywords: `Convolutional neural network (CNN),face verification,image classification,incremental minibatch training procedure,min-max objective`,number: `7`,pages: `2872--2885`,pmid: `28613185`,title: `Improving CNN performance accuracies with min-max objective`,volume: `29`,year: `2018`},

Natarajan`,editor: ` `,abstract: `The backpropagation algorithm, which had been originally introduced in the 1970s, is the workhorse of learning in neural networks. This backpropagation algorithm makes use of the famous machine learning algorithm known as Gradient Descent, which is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or of the approximate gradient) of the function at the current point. In this paper, we develop an alternative to the backpropagation without the use of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, but instead we are going to devise a new algorithm to find the error in the weights and biases of an artificial neuron using Moore-Penrose Pseudo Inverse. The numerical studies and the experiments performed on various datasets are used to verify the working of this alternative algorithm.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1802.00027`,eprint: `1802.00027`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,keywords: `Artificial Neural Network (ANN),Backpropagation,Machine Learning,Moore-Penrose Pseudo Inverse`,pages: `1--15`,title: `A new backpropagation algorithm without gradient descent`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2018 A New Backpropagation Algorithm without Gradient Descent.pdf`},

  {key: `2018_pfeiffer_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Michael Pfeiffer and Thomas Pfeil`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inspired by information processing in biology, where sparse and asynchronous binary signals are communicated and processed in a massively parallel fashion. SNNs on neuromorphic hardware exhibit favorable properties such as low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven information processing. This makes them interesting candidates for the efficient implementation of deep neural networks, the method of choice for many machine learning tasks. In this review, we address the opportunities that deep spiking networks offer and investigate in detail the challenges associated with training SNNs in a way that makes them competitive with conventional deep learning, but simultaneously allows for efficient mapping to hardware. A wide range of training methods for SNNs is presented, ranging from the conversion of conventional deep networks into SNNs, constrained training before conversion, spiking variants of backpropagation, and biologically motivated variants of STDP. The goal of our review is to define a categorization of SNN training methods, and summarize their advantages and drawbacks. We further discuss relationships between SNNs and binary networks, which are becoming popular for efficient digital hardware implementation. Neuromorphic hardware platforms have great potential to enable deep spiking networks in real-world applications. We compare the suitability of various neuromorphic systems that have been developed over the past years, and investigate potential use cases. Neuromorphic approaches and conventional machine learning should not be considered simply two solutions to the same classes of problems, instead it is possible to identify and exploit their task-specific advantages. Deep SNNs offer great opportunities to work with new types of event-based sensors, exploit temporal codes and local on-chip learning, and we have so far just scratched the surface of realizing these advantages in practical applications.`,doi: `10.3389/fnins.2018.00774`,issn: `1662-4548`,journal: `Frontiers in Neuroscience`,keywords: `deep learning,event-based computing,neural networks,neural networks, spiking neurons, neuromorphic engineering, event-based computing, deep learning, binary networks,neuromorphic engineering,spiking neurons`,number: `October`,title: `Deep Learning With Spiking Neurons: Opportunities and Challenges`,volume: `12`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Spiking Neural Networks/2018 Deep Learning With Spiking Neurons Opportunities and Challenges.pdf`},

Moreover, it allows for anytime ensemble predictions for improved performance and uncertainty estimates by sampling from the weight distribution.

We show that well-known reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be adapted to learn robust control policies capable of imitating a broad range of example motion clips, while also learning complex recoveries, adapting to changes in morphology, and accomplishing userspecified goals. Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills.

With considerable effort and wide scale of sensitivity, studies could enable optimized well completion design parameters such as optimal cluster spacing, optimal proppant loading, optimal well spacing, etc. Yet, today, less than 5% of the wells fractured in North America are designed using advanced simulation due to the required level of data, skillset, and long computing times.

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

However, the space of graph neural network architectures remains highly fragmented impeding the development of optimized implementations similar to what is available for convolutional neural networks. In this work, we present BiGraphNet, a graph neural network architecture that generalizes many popular graph neural network models and enables new efficient operations similar to those supported by ConvNets. By explicitly separating the input and output nodes, BiGraphNet: (i) generalizes the graph convolution to support new efficient operations such as coarsened graph convolutions (similar to strided convolution in convnets), multiple input graphs convolution and graph expansions (unpooling) which can be used to implement various graph architectures such as graph autoencoders, and graph residual nets; and (ii) accelerates and scales the computations and memory requirements in hierarchical networks by performing computations only at specified output nodes.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1812.03813`,eprint: `1812.03813`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,pages: `1--6`,title: `Hierarchical bipartite graph convolution networks`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/graph theory and neural networks/2018 Hierarchical Bipartite Graph Convolution Networks.pdf`},

In this context, a recent algorithm called CapsNet that implements an approach based on activity vectors and dynamic routing between capsules may overcome some of the limitations of the current state of the art artificial neural networks (ANN) classifiers, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the CapsNet algorithm in comparison with three well-known classifiers (Fisher-faces, LeNet, and ResNet). We tested the classification accuracy on four datasets with a different number of instances and classes, including images of faces, traffic signs, and everyday objects. The evaluation results show that even for simple architectures, training the CapsNet algorithm requires significant computational resources and its classification performance falls below the average accuracy values of the other three classifiers. However, we argue that CapsNet seems to be a promising new technique for image classification, and further experiments using more robust computation resources and re-fined CapsNet architectures may produce better outcomes.`,eprint: `1805.11195`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1805.11195 [cs, stat]`,title: `CapsNet comparative performance evaluation for image classification`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11195`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/CapsNet comparative performance evaluation for image classification - Mukhometzianov and Carrillo.pdf`,tags: `#merged,tesse`},

Taking inspiration from the network properties of biological neural networks (e.g. sparsity, scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice) artificial neural networks, too, should not have fully-connected layers. Here we propose sparse evolutionary training of artificial neural networks, an algorithm which evolves an initial sparse topology (Erdos-R/'enyi random graph) of two consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during learning. Our method replaces artificial neural networks fully-connected layers with sparse ones before training, reducing quadratically the number of parameters, with no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on restricted Boltzmann machines, multi-layer perceptrons, and convolutional neural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning on 15 datasets. Our approach has the potential to enable artificial neural networks to scale up beyond what is currently possible.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1707.04780`,doi: `10.1038/s41467-018-04316-3`,eprint: `1707.04780`,issn: `20411723`,journal: `Nature Communications`,number: `1`,pages: `1--12`,pmid: `29921910`,publisher: `Springer US`,title: `Scalable training of artificial neural networks with adaptive sparse connectivity inspired by network science`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04316-3`,volume: `9`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2018 Scalable training of artificial neural networks with adaptive sparse connectivity inspired by network science.pdf`},

  {key: `2018_li_etal`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,author: `Huan Li and Zhongzhi Zhang`,translator: ` `,abstract: `Estimating the relative importance of vertices and edges is a fundamental issue in the analysis of complex networks, and has found vast applications in various aspects, such as social networks, power grids, and biological networks. Most previous work focuses on metrics of vertex importance and methods for identifying powerful vertices, while related work for edges is much lesser, especially for weighted networks, due to the computational challenge. In this paper, we propose to use the well-known Kirchhoff index as the measure of edge centrality in weighted networks, called \$/theta\$-Kirchhoff edge centrality. The Kirchhoff index of a network is defined as the sum of effective resistances over all vertex pairs. The centrality of an edge e is reected in the increase of Kirchhoff index of the network when the edge e is partially deactivated, characterized by a parameter \$/theta\$. We define two equivalent measures for \$/theta\$-Kirchhoff edge centrality. Both are global metrics and have a better discriminating power than commonly used measures, based on local or partial structural information of networks, e.g. edge betweenness and spanning edge centrality. Despite the strong advantages of Kirchhoff index as a centrality measure and its wide applications, computing the exact value of Kirchhoff edge centrality for each edge in a graph is computationally demanding. To solve this problem, for each of the \$/theta\$-Kirchhoff edge centrality metrics, we present an efficient algorithm to compute its \$/theta\$-approximation for all the m edges in nearly linear time in m. The proposed \$/theta\$-Kirchhoff edge centrality is the first global metric of edge importance that can be provably approximated in nearly-linear time. Moreover, according to the \$/theta\$-Kirchhoff edge centrality, we present a \$/theta\$-Kirchhoff vertex centrality measure, as well as a fast algorithm that can compute \$/theta\$-approximate Kirchhoff vertex centrality for all the n vertices in nearly linear time in m.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1708.05959`,doi: `10.1137/1.9781611975031.153`,eprint: `1708.05959`,isbn: `9781611975031`,journal: `Proceedings of the Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms`,pages: `2377--2396`,title: `Kirchhoff index as a measure of edge centrality in weighted networks: Nearly linear time algorithms`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2018 Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms - Czumaj.pdf`},

We pursue a careful exploration of approaches to allow pooling to learn and to adapt to complex and variable patterns. The two primary directions lie in: (1) learning a pooling function via (two strategies of) combining of max and average pooling, and (2) learning a pooling function in the form of a tree-structured fusion of pooling filters that are themselves learned. In our experiments every generalized pooling operation we explore improves performance when used in place of average or max pooling. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pooling operations provide a boost in invariance properties relative to conventional pooling and set the state of the art on several widely adopted benchmark datasets. These benefits come with only a light increase in computational overhead during training (ranging from additional 5 to 15 percent in time complexity) and a very modest increase in the number of model parameters (e.g., additional 1, 9, and 27 parameters for mixed, gated, and 2-level tree pooling operators, respectively). To gain more insights about our proposed pooling methods, we also visualize the learned pooling masks and the embeddings of the internal feature responses for different pooling operations. Our proposed pooling operations are easy to implement and can be applied within various deep neural network architectures.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1509.08985`,doi: `10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2703082`,eprint: `1509.08985`,issn: `01628828`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence`,keywords: `Convolutional neural networks,deep learning,optimization,pooling functions,supervised classification`,number: `4`,pages: `863--875`,pmid: `28504932`,title: `Generalizing Pooling Functions in CNNs: Mixed, Gated, and Tree`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08985`,volume: `40`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Optimizers/generalizing pooling functions in convolutional neural networks - mixed, gated, - lee et al.pdf`,tags: `optimization,#merged`},

Here we characterise and quantify a major ocean plastic accumulation zone formed in subtropical waters between California and Hawaii: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). Our model, calibrated with data from multi-vessel and aircraft surveys, predicted at least 79 (45-129) thousand tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million km2; a figure four to sixteen times higher than previously reported. We explain this difference through the use of more robust methods to quantify larger debris. Over three-quarters of the GPGP mass was carried by debris larger than 5 cm and at least 46% was comprised of fishing nets. Microplastics accounted for 8% of the total mass but 94% of the estimated 1.8 (1.1-3.6) trillion pieces floating in the area. Plastic collected during our study has specific characteristics such as small surface-to-volume ratio, indicating that only certain types of debris have the capacity to persist and accumulate at the surface of the GPGP. Finally, our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.`,doi: `10.1038/s41598-018-22939-w`,issn: `20452322`,journal: `Scientific Reports`,number: `1`,pmid: `29568057`,title: `Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic`,url: `http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w`,volume: `8`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/2018 Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic - Lebreton et al..pdf`,tags: `tesse,#merged,#corrupted author`},

We present several insights from extensive numerical experiments regarding optimization of learning parameters and network configuration to improve its accuracy. We also describe a number of strategies to optimize the SNN for implementation in memory and energy constrained hardware, including approximations in computing the neuronal dynamics and reduced precision in storing the synaptic weights. Experiments reveal that even with 3-bit synaptic weights, the classification accuracy of the designed SNN does not degrade beyond 1% as compared to the floating-point baseline. Further, the proposed SNN, which is trained based on the precise spike timing information outperforms an equivalent non-spiking artificial neural network (ANN) trained using back propagation, especially at low bit precision.

Contemporary computational theories propose that these two contrasting functions can be accomplished by big-loop recurrence, whereby the output of the system is recirculated back into the hippocampus. We use ultra-high-resolution fMRI to provide support for this hypothesis, by showing that retrieved information is presented as a new input on the superficial entorhinal cortex—driven by functional connectivity between the deep and superficial entorhinal layers. Further, the magnitude of this laminar connectivity correlated with inferential performance, demonstrating its importance for behavior. Our findings offer a novel perspective on information processing within the hippocampus and support a unifying framework in which the hippocampus captures higher-order structure across experiences, by creating a dynamic memory space from separate episodic codes for individual experiences. The hippocampus is central for storing distinct episodes, while also supporting integration across related episodes. Using ultra-high-resolution fMRI, Koster et al. provide evidence for a core computational principle (big-loop recurrence) that can account for these apparently conflicting hippocampal roles.`,doi: `10.1016/j.neuron.2018.08.009`,issn: `10974199`,journal: `Neuron`,keywords: `7 Tesla,MVPA,fMRI,hippocampus,paired-associate inference task`,number: `6`,pages: `1342--1354.e6`,pmid: `30236285`,title: `Big-Loop Recurrence within the Hippocampal System Supports Integration of Information across Episodes`,volume: `99`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2018 Big-Loop Recurrence within the Hippocampal System Supports Integration of Information across Episodes - Koster et al.pdf`},

These studies, however, used relatively shallow architectures, and only one layer was trainable. Another line of research has demonstrated – using rate-based neural networks trained with back-propagation – that having many layers increases the recognition robustness, an approach known as deep learning. We thus designed a deep SNN, comprising several convolutional (trainable with STDP) and pooling layers. We used a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, and less activated neurons fire later or not at all. The network was exposed to natural images. Thanks to STDP, neurons progressively learned features corresponding to prototypical patterns that were both salient and frequent. Only a few tens of examples per category were required and no label was needed. After learning, the complexity of the extracted features increased along the hierarchy, from edge detectors in the first layer to object prototypes in the last layer. Coding was very sparse, with only a few thousands spikes per image, and in some cases the object category could be reasonably well inferred from the activity of a single higher-order neuron. More generally, the activity of a few hundreds of such neurons contained robust category information, as demonstrated using a classifier on Caltech 101, ETH-80, and MNIST databases. We also demonstrate the superiority of STDP over other unsupervised techniques such as random crops (HMAX) or auto-encoders. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of STDP with latency coding may be a key to understanding the way that the primate visual system learns, its remarkable processing speed and its low energy consumption. These mechanisms are also interesting for artificial vision systems, particularly for hardware solutions.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1611.01421`,doi: `10.1016/j.neunet.2017.12.005`,eprint: `1611.01421`,issn: `18792782`,journal: `Neural Networks`,keywords: `Deep learning,Object recognition,STDP,Spiking neural network,Temporal coding`,pages: `56--67`,pmid: `29328958`,publisher: `Elsevier Ltd`,title: `STDP-based spiking deep convolutional neural networks for object recognition`,url: `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2017.12.005`,volume: `99`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Spiking Neural Networks/2018 STDP-based spiking deep convolutional neural networks for object recognition.pdf`},

Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator.

In doing so, we build on and refine previous scientometric research by counting query hit data as an indicator of the number of accessible records. Iterative query optimization makes it possible to identify a maximum number of hits for most ASEBDs. The results were validated in terms of their capacity to assess database size by comparing them with official information on database sizes or previous scientometric studies. The queries used here are replicable, so size information can be updated quickly.

This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of three lossy, i.e. AAC, Ogg Vorbis, and Opus, and three lossless compression, i.e. FLAC, TrueAudio, and WavPack, for multichannel audio signals, including stereo, 5.1 and 7.1 channels. Experiments were conducted on the same three audio files but with different channel configurations. The performance of each encoder was evaluated based on its encoding time (averaged over 100 times), data reduction, and audio quality. Usually, there is always a trade-off between the three metrics. To simplify the evaluation, a new integrated performance metric was proposed that combines all the three performance metrics. Using the new measure, FLAC was found to be the best lossless compression, while Ogg Vorbis and Opus were found to be the best for lossy compression depends on the channel configuration. This result could be used in determining the proper audio format for multichannel audio systems.`,doi: `10.11591/ijeecs.v10.i1.pp146-153`,issn: `25024760`,journal: `Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science`,keywords: `Compression Ratio,Encoding Time,Lossless Compression,Lossy Compression,Multichannel Audio,PEAQ`,number: `1`,pages: `146--153`,title: `Performance evaluation of multichannel audio compression`,volume: `10`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/2018 Performance Evaluation of Multichannel Audio Compression - Gunawan and Kartiwi.pdf`},

This paper investigates the analogous problem in the audio domain: How to transfer the style of a reference audio signal to a target audio content? We propose a flexible framework for the task, which uses a sound texture model to extract statistics characterizing the reference audio style, followed by an optimization-based audio texture synthesis to modify the target content. In contrast to mainstream optimization-based visual transfer method, the proposed process is initialized by the target content instead of random noise and the optimized loss is only about texture, not structure. These differences proved key for audio style transfer in our experiments. In order to extract features of interest, we investigate different architectures, whether pre-trained on other tasks, as done in image style transfer, or engineered based on the human auditory system. Experimental results on different types of audio signal confirm the potential of the proposed approach.`,annote: `From Duplicate 2 (Audio Style Transfer - Grinstein, Eric; Duong, Ngoc Q.K.; Ozerov, Alexey; Perez, Patrick)preprint`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1710.11385`,doi: `10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461711`,eprint: `1710.11385`,isbn: `9781538646588`,issn: `15206149`,journal: `ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings`,keywords: `Audio style transfer,Auditory system,Deep neural network,Sound texture model,Texture synthesis`,pages: `586--590`,title: `Audio Style Transfer`,volume: `2018-April`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2018 Audio Style Transfer - Grinstein et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Centrality measures are an important analysis mechanism to uncover vital elements of complex networks.

In this tutorial, we explain how the use of neural network learning algorithms can render the application of the metrics in complex networks of arbitrary size. Moreover, the tutorial describes how to identify the best configuration for neural network training and learning such for tasks, besides presenting an easy way to generate and acquire training data. We do so by means of a general methodology, using complex network models adaptable to any application. We show that a regression model generated by the neural network successfully approximates the metric values and therefore are a robust, effective alternative in real-world applications. The methodology and proposed machine learning model use only a fraction of time with respect to other approximation algorithms, which is crucial in complex network applications.`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,keywords: `Artificial intelligence and complex networks,Machine learning in complex networks,Network metrics and centralities`,number: `5`,title: `Machine learning in network centrality measures: Tutorial and outlook`,volume: `51`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/graph theory and neural networks/2018 Machine Learning in Network Centrality Measures Tutorial and Outlook.pdf`},

DAG-CNNs not only fuse the feature extraction and classification stages of the ECG classification into a single automated learning procedure, but also utilized multi-scale features and perform score-level fusion of multiple classifiers automatically. Therefore, DAG-CNN negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted features. In most of the current approaches, only the high level features which extracted by the last layer of CNN are used. Instead of performing feature level fusion manually and feeding the results into a classifier, the proposed multi-scale system can automatically learn different level of features, combine them and predict the output label.

There are very few constraints on DMI design as such systems can be easily reconfigured, offering near limitless flexibility for music-making. Given that new acoustic musical instruments have in many cases been created in response to the limitations of available technologies, what motivates the development of new DMIs? We conducted an interview study with ten designers of new DMIs, in order to explore (a) the motivations electronic musicians may have for wanting to build their own instruments; and (b) the extent to which these motivations relate to the context in which the artist works and performs (academic vs club settings). We found that four categories of motivation were mentioned most often: M1 – wanting to bring greater embodiment to the activity of performing and producing electronic music; M2 – wanting to improve audience experiences of DMI performances; M3 – wanting to develop new sounds, and M4 – wanting to build responsive systems for improvisation. There were also some detectable trends in motivation according to the context in which the artists work and perform.

The concept is evaluated on three datasets (PAMAP2, SVHN, CIFAR-10). Our results show that this approach is in particular beneficial for multimodal datasets (PAMAP2) where it outperforms networks using full precision weights in the first layer by 1.92 percentage points (pp) while consuming only 2 % of the chip area.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1812.03410`,eprint: `1812.03410`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,number: `Nips`,pages: `2--5`,title: `Binary input layer: Training of cnn models with binary input data`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/binary nns/2018 Binary Input Layer Training of CNN models with binary input data.pdf`},

Incorporating this in deep learning frameworks would allow us to explicitly encode known notions of geometry, instead of having the network implicitly learn them from data. However, performing eigendecomposition within a network requires the ability to differentiate this operation. Unfortunately, while theoretically doable, this introduces numerical instability in the optimization process in practice. In this paper, we introduce an eigendecomposition-free approach to training a deep network whose loss depends on the eigenvector corresponding to a zero eigenvalue of a matrix predicted by the network. We demonstrate on several tasks, including keypoint matching and 3D pose estimation, that our approach is much more robust than explicit differentiation of the eigendecomposition, It has better convergence properties and yields state-of-the-art results on both tasks.`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,keywords: `Eigendecomposition,End-to-end learning,Geometric vision,Singular value decomposition`,pages: `1--16`,title: `Eigendecomposition-free training of deep networks with zero eigenvalue-based losses`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2018 Eigendecomposition-Free Training of Deep Networks with Zero Eigenvalue-Based Losses - Dang et al..pdf`},

Accompanying this recognition of the central role of knowledge in today's economies has been an added focus on information, technology, learning and the accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance that results therefrom. Closely connected to these developments has been the advent of big data; and as information becomes available at greater volumes and higher speed, the focus is shifting from quantity to the quality of the information collected and the manner in which it is used. In this respect, Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques constitute valuable tools for structuring and evaluating complex decision situations, and can allow for more informed, potentially better decisions. MCDA techniques are able to build on the knowledge of expert participants in a given field, and produce assessment systems based on values and experience. Constructivist in nature, this approach has grown exponentially over the past few decades, causing a change in the decision-making arena in general, and in the field of decision support systems (DSS) in particular. The objective of this special issue is to bring together recent developments and methodological contributions within MCDA, with the challenges which characterize the knowledge-based economy, as they pertain to the themes of technological forecasting and social change.`,doi: `10.1016/j.techfore.2018.01.028`,issn: `00401625`,journal: `Technological Forecasting and Social Change`,number: `xxxx`,pages: `1--3`,publisher: `Elsevier`,title: `MCDA in knowledge-based economies: Methodological developments and real world applications`,volume: `131`,year: `2018`,tags: `#corrupted author,#merged`},
  {key: `2018_cao_etal1`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Weipeng Cao and Xizhao Wang and Zhong Ming and Jinzhu Gao`,abstract: `In big data fields, with increasing computing capability, artificial neural networks have shown great strength in solving data classification and regression problems. The traditional training of neural networks depends generally on the error back propagation method to iteratively tune all the parameters. When the number of hidden layers increases, this kind of training has many problems such as slow convergence, time consuming, and local minima.

  {key: `2018_broughton_etal1`,type: `book`,author: `S Allen Broughton and Kurt Bryan`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `A thorough guide to the classical and contemporary mathematical methods of modern signal and image processing. Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets presents a thorough introduction to the mathematical foundations of signal and image processing. Key concepts and applications are addressed in a thought-provoking manner and are implemented using vector, matrix, and linear algebra methods. With a balanced focus on mathematical theory and computational techniques, this self-contained book equips readers with the essential knowledge needed to transition smoothly from mathematical models to practical digital data applications. The book first establishes a complete vector space and matrix framework for analyzing signals and images. Classical methods such as the discrete Fourier transform, the discrete cosine transform, and their application to JPEG compression are outlined followed by coverage of the Fourier series and the general theory of inner product spaces and orthogonal bases. The book then addresses convolution, filtering, and windowing techniques for signals and images. Finally, modern approaches are introduced, including wavelets and the theory of filter banks as a means of understanding the multiscale localized analysis underlying the JPEG 2000 compression standard.. Throughout the book, examples using image compression demonstrate how mathematical theory translates into application. Additional applications such as progressive transmission of images, image denoising, spectrographic analysis, and edge detection are discussed. Each chapter provides a series of exercises as well as a MATLAB project that allows readers to apply mathematical concepts to solving real problems. Additional MATLAB routines are available via the book's related Web site. With its insightful treatment of the underlying mathematics in image compression and signal processing, Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets is an ideal book for mathematics, engineering, and computer science courses at the upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for mathematicians, engineers, and other practitioners who would like to learn more about the relevance of mathematics in digital data processing.`,annote: `OCLC: 1030990110`,doi: `10.1002/9781118032442`,edition: `2`,isbn: `9781119473329`,journal: `Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets: Applications to Signal and Image Processing: Second Edition`,pages: `1--442`,publisher: `John Wiley`,shorttitle: `Discrete fourier analysis and wavelets`,title: `Discrete fourier analysis and wavelets: Applications to signal and image processing: Second edition`,year: `2018`,tags: `#merged`},

In several emerging fields, for example, computer vision and quantum control, there is a growing need for spline interpolation on curved, non-Euclidean space. The generalization of cubic splines to manifolds is not self-evident, with several distinct approaches. One possibility is to mimic the acceleration minimizing property, which leads to Riemannian cubics. This, however, requires the solution of a coupled set of nonlinear boundary value problems that cannot be integrated explicitly, even if formulae for geodesics are available. Another possibility is to mimic De Casteljau's algorithm, which leads to generalized B/'ezier curves. To construct C2-splines from such curves is a complicated nonlinear problem, until now lacking numerical methods. Here we provide an iterative algorithm for C2-splines on Riemannian symmetric spaces, and we prove convergence of linear order. In terms of numerical tractability and computational efficiency, the new method surpasses those based on Riemannian cubics. Each iteration is parallel and thus suitable for multicore implementation. We demonstrate the algorithm for three geometries of interest: the n-sphere, complex projective space, and the real Grassmannian.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1703.09589`,doi: `10.1137/17M1123353`,eprint: `1703.09589`,issn: `00361429`,journal: `SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis`,keywords: `B/'ezier curve,Cubic spline,De Casteljau,Riemannian symmetric space`,number: `4`,pages: `2623--2647`,title: `A numerical algorithm for C2-splines on symmetric spaces`,volume: `56`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Computer Graphics/Splines/2018 A Numerical Algorithm for \$C^2\$-Splines on Symmetric Spaces - Bogfjellmo et al..pdf`},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

An automorphism T of (X, \$/mu\$) has the weak Pinsker property if for every \$/epsilon\$> 0 it has a splitting into a direct product of a Bernoulli shift and an automorphism of entropy less than \$/epsilon\$. This property was introduced by Thouvenot, who asked whether it holds for all ergodic automorphisms. This paper proves that it does. The proof actually gives a more general result. Firstly, it gives a relative version: any factor map from one ergodic automorphism to another can be enlarged by arbitrarily little entropy to become relatively Bernoulli. Secondly, using some facts about relative orbit equivalence, the analogous result holds for all free and ergodic measure-preserving actions of a countable amenable group. The key to this work is a new result about measure concentration. Suppose now that \$/mu\$ is a probability measure on a finite product space An, and endow this space with its Hamming metric. We prove that \$/mu\$ may be represented as a mixture of other measures in which (i) most of the weight in the mixture is on measures that exhibit a strong kind of concentration, and (ii) the number of summands is bounded in terms of the difference between the Shannon entropy of \$/mu\$ and the combined Shannon entropies of its marginals.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1705.00302`,doi: `10.1007/s10240-018-0098-3`,eprint: `1705.00302`,issn: `16181913`,journal: `Publications Mathematiques de l'Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques`,number: `1`,title: `Measure concentration and the weak Pinsker property`,volume: `128`,year: `2018`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/misc/2018 Measure concentration and the weak Pinsker property - Austin.pdf`},

It illustrates how to build a system network of neurons to perform spike-based information processing, computing, and high-level cognitive tasks. It is beneficial to a wide spectrum of readers, including undergraduate and postgraduate students and researchers who are interested in neuromorphic computing and neuromorphic engineering, as well as engineers and professionals in industry who are involved in the design and applications of neuromorphic cognitive systems, neuromorphic sensors and processors, and cognitive robotics. The book formulates a systematic framework, from the basic mathematical and computational methods in spike-based neural encoding, learning in both single and multi-layered networks, to a near cognitive level composed of memory and cognition. Since the mechanisms for integrating spiking neurons integrate to formulate cognitive functions as in the brain are little understood, studies of neuromorphic cognitive systems are urgently needed. The topics covered in this book range from the neuronal level to the system level. In the neuronal level, synaptic adaptation plays an important role in learning patterns. In order to perform higher-level cognitive functions such as recognition and memory, spiking neurons with learning abilities are consistently integrated, building a system with encoding, learning and memory functionalities.

Despite their promise, many recurrent models have to read the whole text word by word, making it slow to handle long documents. For example, it is difficult to use a recurrent network to read a book and answer questions about it. In this paper, we present an approach of reading text while skipping irrelevant information if needed. The underlying model is a recurrent network that learns how far to jump after reading a few words of the input text. We employ a standard policy gradient method to train the model to make discrete jumping decisions. In our benchmarks on four different tasks, including number prediction, sentiment analysis, news article classification and automatic Q&A, our proposed model, a modified LSTM with jumping, is up to 6 times faster than the standard sequential LSTM, while maintaining the same or even better accuracy.`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,title: `Learning to skim text`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06877`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/Carnegie Mellon University - Yu et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extractors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by factorizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained simultaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets and achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art models, even though our model architecture is orders of magnitude less complex.

Given <text, audio> pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequenceto-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than samplelevel autoregressive methods.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1703.10135`,doi: `10.21437/Interspeech.2017-1452`,eprint: `1703.10135`,issn: `19909772`,journal: `Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH`,keywords: `Sequence-To-sequence,Text-To-speech synthesis,end-To-end model.,speech synthesis,state of the art`,pages: `4006--4010`,title: `Tacotron: Towards end-To-end speech synthesis`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135`,volume: `2017-Augus`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2017 Tacotron Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis - Wang et al.pdf`,tags: `speech synthesis,#corrupted author,state of the art`},

In this paper, we compute time-dependent probability density functions (PDFs) in order to investigate stochastic logistic and Gompertz models, which are two of the most popular growth models. We consider different types of short-correlated multiplicative and additive noise sources and compare the time-dependent PDFs in the two models, elucidating the effects of the additive and multiplicative noises on the form of PDFs. We demonstrate an interesting transition from a unimodal to a bimodal PDF as the multiplicative noise increases for a fixed value of the additive noise. A much weaker (leaky) attractor in the Gompertz model leads to a significant (singular) growth of the population of a very small size. We point out the limitation of using stationary PDFs, mean value and variance in understanding statistical properties of the growth in non-stationary states, highlighting the importance of time-dependent PDFs. We further compare these two models from the perspective of information change that occurs during the growth process. Specifically, we define an infinitesimal distance at any time by comparing two PDFs at times infinitesimally apart and sum these distances in time. The total distance along the trajectory quantifies the total number of different states that the system undergoes in time, and is called the information length. We show that the time-evolution of the two models become more similar when measured in units of the information length and point out the merit of using the information length in unifying and understanding the dynamic evolution of different growth processes.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1708.02789`,doi: `10.1088/1742-5468/aa9a66`,eprint: `1708.02789`,issn: `17425468`,journal: `Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment`,keywords: `population dynamics,stochastic processes`,number: `12`,pages: `1--33`,title: `Time-dependent probability density functions and information geometry in stochastic logistic and Gompertz models`,volume: `2017`,year: `2017`},

We answer this question through a careful analysis of previous work on BinaryNets, in terms of training strategies, regularization, and activation approximation. Our findings first reveal that a low learning rate is highly preferred to avoid frequent sign changes of the weights, which often makes the learning of BinaryNets unstable. Secondly, we propose to use PReLU instead of ReLU in a BinaryNet to conveniently absorb the scale factor for weights to the activation function, which enjoys high computation efficiency for binarized layers while maintains high approximation accuracy. Thirdly, we reveal that instead of imposing L2 regularization, driving all weights to zero which contradicts with the setting of BinaryNets, we introduce a regularization term that encourages the weights to be bipolar. Fourthly, we discover that the failure of binarizing the last layer, which is essential for high compression rate, is due to the improper output range. We propose to use a scale layer to bring it to normal. Last but not least, we propose multiple binarizations to improve the approximation of the activations. The composition of all these enables us to train BinaryNets with both high compression rate and high accuracy, which is strongly supported by our extensive empirical study.`,journal: `31st AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2017`,keywords: `Machine Learning Methods`,pages: `2625--2631`,title: `How to train a compact binary neural network with high accuracy`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/binary nns/2017 How to Train a Compact Binary Neural Network with High Accuracy.pdf`},

Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate 'reasonable bounds' - linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures.

To address the huge computational challenge in deep learning, many tools exploit hardware features such as multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs to shorten the training and inference time. However, different tools exhibit different features and running performance when they train different types of deep networks on different hardware platforms, making it difficult for end users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we present our attempt to benchmark several state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated deep learning software tools, including Caffe, CNTK, TensorFlow, and Torch. We focus on evaluating the running time performance (i.e., speed) of these tools with three popular types of neural networks on two representative CPU platforms and three representative GPU platforms. Our contribution is two-fold. First, for end users of deep learning software tools, our benchmarking results can serve as a reference to selecting appropriate hardware platforms and software tools.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1411.4038`,doi: `10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2572683`,eprint: `1411.4038`,issn: `01628828`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence`,keywords: `Convolutional Networks,Deep Learning,Semantic Segmentation,Transfer Learning`,number: `4`,pages: `640--651`,pmid: `27244717`,title: `Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038`,volume: `39`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation - Long et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition.

We begin with a 35-year review of the motivations and drivers of neuromorphic computing, then look at the major research areas of the field, which we define as neuro-inspired models, algorithms and learning approaches, hardware and devices, supporting systems, and finally applications. We conclude with a broad discussion on the major research topics that need to be addressed in the coming years to see the promise of neuromorphic computing fulfilled.

  {key: `2017_scellier_etal`,type: `article`,translator: ` `,author: `Benjamin Scellier and Yoshua Bengio`,editor: ` `,abstract: `We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well-defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point or stationary distribution) toward a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged toward their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal "back-propagated" during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanismsimilar to Backpropagation couldbe implementedby brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not. We also showexperimentally that multi-layer recurrently connected networks with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers can be trained by Equilibrium Propagation on the permutation-invariant MNIST task.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1602.05179`,doi: `10.3389/fncom.2017.00024`,eprint: `1602.05179`,issn: `16625188`,journal: `Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience`,keywords: `Artificial neural network,Backpropagation algorithm,Biologically plausible learning rule,Contrastive hebbian learning,Deep learning,Fixed point,Hopfield networks,Spike-timing dependent plasticity`,pages: `1--21`,title: `Equilibrium propagation: Bridging the gap between energy-based models and backpropagation`,volume: `11`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2017 Equilibrium Propagation Bridging the Gap Between Energy-Based Models and Backpropagation.pdf`},

These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to scribble over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach generates more realistic, diverse, and controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.`,annote: `preprint`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1612.00835`,doi: `10.1109/CVPR.2017.723`,eprint: `1612.00835`,isbn: `9781538604571`,journal: `Proceedings - 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2017`,pages: `6836--6845`,title: `Scribbler: Controlling deep image synthesis with sketch and color`,volume: `2017-Janua`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Deep Learning/2017 Scribbler Controlling Deep Image Synthesis with Sketch and Color - Sangkloy et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, f(x) = x sigmoid(\$/beta\$x), which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1710.05941`,eprint: `1710.05941`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,pages: `1--13`,title: `Searching for activation functions`,url: `https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941`,year: `2017`},

Both ratiometric redox probes as well as the pH control SypHer were expressed in the cytosol of blood-stage parasites. Both redox sensors showed reproducible sensitivity towards H2O2 in the lower micromolar range in vitro and in the parasites.

None of the quinolines or artemisinins tested had detectable direct effects on the H2O2 homeostasis at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. However, pre-treatment of the cells with antimalarial drugs or heat shock led to a higher tolerance towards exogenous H2O2.

As the number of players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase their final rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to find a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov Games. In this paper, we introduce a new definition of ϵ-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy's quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellman-like residuals implies to learn such an ϵ-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the Lp norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium in generic multiplayer general-sum turn-based MGs.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1606.08718`,eprint: `1606.08718`,journal: `Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, AISTATS 2017`,number: `1`,title: `Learning Nash equilibrium for general-sum Markov games from batch data`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Game Theory/2016 Learning Nash Equilibrium for General Sum Markov Games from Batch Data  2016PerolatLearning.pdf`,tags: `game theory,#merged,#corrupted author`},

We show that well-known reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be adapted to learn robust control policies capable of imitating a broad range of example motion clips, while also learning complex recoveries, adapting to changes in morphology, and accomplishing user-specified goals. Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills. We demonstrate results using multiple characters (human, Atlas robot, bipedal dinosaur, dragon) and a large variety of skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.`,arxivid: `1804.02717v1`,doi: `10.1145/3197517.3201311`,eprint: `1804.02717v1`,eprinttype: `arXiv`,issn: `0730-0301`,journal: `ACM Transactions on Graphics`,langid: `english`,number: `4`,pages: `1--14`,shorttitle: `DeepMimic`,title: `DeepMimic : Example-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning of Physics-Based Character Skills`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02717`,urldate: `2019-03-26`,volume: `37`,year: `2017`},

The purpose of the present research is to develop and test models of musical similarity perception inspired by a transformational approach which conceives of similarity between two perceptual objects in terms of the complexity of the cognitive operations required to transform the representation of the first object into that of the second, a process which has been formulated in information-theoretic terms. Specifically, computational simulations are developed based on compression distance in which a probabilistic model is trained on one piece of music and then used to predict, or compress, the notes in a second piece. The more predictable the second piece according to the model, the more efficiently it can be encoded and the greater the similarity between the two pieces. The present research extends an existing information-theoretic model of auditory expectation (IDyOM) to compute compression distances varying in symmetry and normalisation using high-level symbolic features representing aspects of pitch and rhythmic structure. Comparing these compression distances with listeners' similarity ratings between pairs of melodies collected in three experiments demonstrates that the compression-based model provides a good fit to the data and allows the identification of representations, model parameters and compression-based metrics that best account for musical similarity perception. The compression-based model also shows comparable performance to the best-performing algorithms on the MIREX 2005 melodic similarity task.`,doi: `10.1080/09298215.2017.1305419`,issn: `17445027`,journal: `Journal of New Music Research`,keywords: `Similarity,information retrieval,machine learning,perception,representation,timing`,number: `2`,pages: `135--155`,publisher: `Routledge`,title: `Compression-based Modelling of Musical Similarity Perception`,url: `https://doi.org/10.1080/09298215.2017.1305419`,volume: `46`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Musical/Compression-based Modelling of Musical Similarity Perception - Pearce.pdf`},

As GANs are difficult to train much research has focused on this. However, very little of this research has directly exploited gametheoretic techniques. We introduce Generative Adversarial Network Games (GANGs), which explicitly model a finite zero-sum game between a generator (G) and classifier (C) that use mixed strategies. The size of these games precludes exact solution methods, therefore we define resource-bounded best responses (RBBRs), and a resourcebounded Nash Equilibrium (RB-NE) as a pair of mixed strategies such that neither G or C can find a better RBBR. The RB-NE solution concept is richer than the notion of ‘local Nash equilibria’ in that it captures not only failures of escaping local optima of gradient descent, but applies to any approximate best response computations, including methods with random restarts. To validate our approach, we solve GANGs with the Parallel Nash Memory algorithm, which provably monotonically converges to an RB-NE. We compare our results to standard GAN setups, and demonstrate that our method deals well with typical GAN problems such as mode collapse, partial mode coverage and forgetting.`,eprint: `1712.00679`,eprinttype: `arXiv`,journal: `arXiv`,langid: `english`,shorttitle: `GANGs`,title: `GANGs: Generative Adversarial Network Games`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Game Theory/2017 GANGs_Generative Adversarial Network Games  2017OliehoekGANGs.pdf`,tags: `gans,#corrupted author,#merged,game theory`},

The FNN optimization is often viewed from the various perspectives: the optimization of weights, network architecture, activation nodes, learning parameters, learning environment, etc. Researchers adopted such diﬀerent viewpoints mainly to improve the FNN’s generalization ability. The gradient-descent algorithm such as backpropagation has been widely applied to optimize the FNNs. Its success is evident from the FNN’s application to numerous real-world problems. However, due to the limitations of the gradient-based optimization methods, the metaheuristic algorithms including the evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., are still being widely explored by the researchers aiming to obtain generalized FNN for a given problem. This article attempts to summarize a broad spectrum of FNN optimization methodologies including conventional and metaheuristic approaches. This article also tries to connect various research directions emerged out of the FNN optimization practices, such as evolving neural network (NN), cooperative coevolution NN, complex-valued NN, deep learning, extreme learning machine, quantum NN, etc. Additionally, it provides interesting research challenges for future research to cope-up with the present information processing era.`,doi: `10.1016/j.engappai.2017.01.013`,eprint: `1705.05584`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,issn: `0952-1976`,journal: `Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence`,langid: `english`,pages: `97--116`,shorttitle: `Metaheuristic Design of Feedforward Neural Networks`,title: `Metaheuristic Design of Feedforward Neural Networks: A Review of Two Decades of Research`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05584`,urldate: `2019-04-05`,volume: `60`,year: `2017`},

This study adopted one group before and after experimental research design in conducting and gathering information. The training and instruments were administered to 40 third year students in Bukidnon State University, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. Furthermore, this study used descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean, percentages and standard deviation to describe the respondents. The study utilized the F-test and t-test to establish the difference and regression analysis to measure the extent of effect of input and process variables to output variable. The study found out that the instructional trainer has yielded is positive significance in the program status and highly significant in pre-test result. These are in terms of its effects in output variable and written post-test evaluation. The effect is negative and significant in parent's monthly income, significant in pre-test practical and input process variable's effect in post-test practical evaluation. The following conclusions and implications were drawn. The mock up trainer has been instrumental in improving student's score in test and repair wiring/lighting system, servicing car alarm system and a servicing central locking system. This is because the trainer serves as the medium of instruction to help develop the learning of the students for the automotive electrical system, car alarm with central locking system and other automotive vehicle accessories such as ignition system. Understanding such basic principles will enable the students to be self-reliant, more confident of themselves and they will be able to perform auto electrical and car alarm with central locking system installation and trouble-shooting circuits.`,doi: `10.3923/jeasci.2017.9331.9336`,issn: `18187803`,journal: `Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences`,keywords: `Car alann,Central locking system,Central locking system and innovation trainer,Instructional trainer automotive lighting,Post-test evaluation,Servicing`,number: `Specialissue12`,pages: `9331--9336`,title: `An instructional trainer innovation for automotive lighting, car alarm and central locking system`,volume: `12`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Writing/2018ElsevierElsevier Elsevier How to Publish in Scholarly Journals.pdf`},

We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to the text domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrent neural network rather than to the original input itself. The proposed method achieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised and purely supervised tasks.

An organism needs to track fitness-relevant information about its world, but the more information it tracks, the more resources it must devote to perception. As a first step towards a general understanding of this trade-off, we use a tool from information theory, rate-distortion theory, to study large, unstructured environments with fixed, randomly drawn penalties for stimuli confusion ('distortions'). We identify two distinct regimes for organisms in these environments: a high-fidelity regime where perceptual costs grow linearly with environmental complexity, and a low-fidelity regime where perceptual costs are, remarkably, independent of the number of environmental states. This suggests that in environments of rapidly increasing complexity, well-adapted organisms will find themselves able to make, just barely, the most subtle distinctions in their environment.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1506.06138`,doi: `10.1098/rsif.2017.0166`,eprint: `1506.06138`,issn: `17425662`,journal: `Journal of the Royal Society Interface`,keywords: `Information theory,Lossy compression,Neuroscience,Perception,Rate-distortion,Signalling`,number: `130`,pmid: `28490604`,title: `The evolution of lossy compression`,volume: `14`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/2017 The evolution of lossy compression - Marzen and DeDeo.pdf`},

It has been known that using binary weights and activations drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and can replace arithmetic operations with more efficient bitwise operations, leading to much faster test-time inference and lower power consumption. However, previous works on binarizing CNNs usually result in severe prediction accuracy degradation. In this paper, we address this issue with two major innovations: (1) approximating full-precision weights with the linear combination of multiple binary weight bases; (2) employing multiple binary activations to alleviate information loss. The implementation of the resulting binary CNN, denoted as ABC-Net, is shown to achieve much closer performance to its full-precision counterpart, and even reach the comparable prediction accuracy on ImageNet and forest trail datasets, given adequate binary weight bases and activations.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1711.11294`,eprint: `1711.11294`,issn: `10495258`,journal: `Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems`,number: `3`,pages: `345--353`,title: `Towards accurate binary convolutional neural network`,volume: `2017-December`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/binary nns/2017 Towards Accurate Binary Convolutional Neural Networks.pdf`},
  {key: `2017_lin_etal`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Mude Lin and Liang Lin and Xiaodan Liang and Keze Wang and Hui Cheng`,abstract: `3D human articulated pose recovery from monocular image sequences is very challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions, and also the human 3D pose is inherently ambiguous from the monocular imagery. It is thus critical to exploit rich spatial and temporal long-range dependencies among body joints for accurate 3D pose sequence prediction. Existing approaches usually manually design some elaborate prior terms and human body kinematic constraints for capturing structures, which are often insufficient to exploit all intrinsic structures and not scalable for all scenarios. In contrast, this paper presents a Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machine(RPSM) to automatically learn the image-dependent structural constraint and sequence-dependent temporal context by using a multi-stage sequential refinement. At each stage, our RPSM is composed of three modules to predict the 3D pose sequences based on the previously learned 2D pose representations and 3D poses: (i) a 2D pose module extracting the image-dependent pose representations, (ii) a 3D pose recurrent module regressing 3D poses and (iii) a feature adaption module serving as a bridge between module (i) and (ii) to enable the representation transformation from 2D to 3D domain. These three modules are then assembled into a sequential prediction framework to refine the predicted poses with multiple recurrent stages. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M dataset and HumanEva-I dataset show that our RPSM outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches for 3D pose estimation.`,eprint: `1707.09695`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1707.09695 [cs]`,langid: `english`,title: `Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machines`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09695`,urldate: `2019-03-26`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machines - Lin et al..pdf`,tags: `tesse,#merged`},

The network employs the convolution theorem so as to cast convolutions in the spatial domain as products in the frequency domain. Moreover, the non-linearity in deep nets, often achieved by a rectifier unit, is here cast as a convolution in the frequency domain. This not only yields a network which is very computationally efficient at testing but also one whose parameters can all be learnt accordingly. The network can be trained using back propagation and is devoid of complex numbers due to the use of the Hartley transform as an alternative to the Fourier transform. Moreover, the network is potentially applicable to other problems elsewhere in computer vision and image processing which are often cast in the frequency domain. We show results on super-resolution and compare against alternatives elsewhere in the literature. In our experiments, our network is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the alternatives with an imperceptible loss of performance.`,eprint: `1712.03037`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1712.03037 [cs]`,title: `A Frequency Domain Neural Network for Fast Image Super-resolution`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03037`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2018 A Frequency Domain Neural Network for Fast Image Super-resolution - Li et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged,#corrupted author,tesse`},

Fictitious play algorithm, first proposed by Brown in 1951, is a popular theoretical model of training agents. However, it is not applicable to larger systems with imperfect information due to its computational complexity. In this paper we propose a modification of the algorithm. We use neural networks for fast approximate calculation of the best responses. An important feature of the algorithm is the absence of agent's a priori knowledge about the system. Agents' learning goes through trial and error with winning actions being reinforced and entered into the training set and losing actions being cut from the strategy.

However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance - even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization schemes, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs, and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. For FNNs we considered (i) ReLU networks without normalization, (ii) batch normalization, (iii) layer normalization, (iv) weight normalization, (v) highway networks, and (vi) residual networks. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1706.02515v5`,eprint: `1706.02515v5`,issn: `10495258`,journal: `Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems`,pages: `972--981`,publisher: `Curran Associates, Inc.`,title: `Self-normalizing neural networks`,url: `http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6698-self-normalizing-neural-networks.pdf`,volume: `2017-Decem`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2017KlambauerSelf Self Normalizing Neural Networks.pdf`,tags: `#corrupted author`},

Several designers are now ‘growing’ their own materials. Despite the large interest shown, this emerging material practice is still scarcely understood in design literature. The aim of this paper is to shed light on what it means to design with growing organisms as collaborators, identifying the defining traits of this novel, designerly way of ‘doing materials’. To do so, we first compare this specific approach to the approaches of others working in the intersections of biology and design. In this way, we outline the boundaries of Growing Design, defining its unique characteristics. We then provide detailed descriptions of three classes of Growing Materials: fungal, bacterial and algal materials. For each class, we bring two examples of designers utilizing these materials for industrial design purposes. This helps to further explain what truly distinguishes Growing Materials from other conventional materials and to understand the challenges in working with them.

However, to achieve high accuracy, the training sets need to be large, diverse, and accurately annotated, which is costly. An alternative to labelling huge amounts of data is to use synthetic images from a simulator. This is cheap as there is no labeling cost, but the synthetic images may not be realistic enough, resulting in poor generalization on real test images. To help close this performance gap, we've developed a method for refining synthetic images to make them look more realistic. We show that training models on these refined images leads to significant improvements in accuracy on various machine learning tasks.`,journal: `Apple Machine Learning Journal`,number: `1`,pages: `1--15`,title: `Improving the Realism of Synthetic Images - Apple`,url: `https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/07/07/GAN.html`,volume: `1`,year: `2017`},

All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropa-gated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which arc decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass - amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1608.05343`,eprint: `1608.05343`,isbn: `9781510855144`,journal: `34th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2017`,pages: `2558--2577`,title: `Decoupled neural interfaces using synthetic gradients`,volume: `4`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2017 Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L2+1) direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet).

In this paper, we propose kernel extended dictionary (KED) for face recognition, which provides an efficient way for combining KDA and SRC. We first learn several kernel principal components of occlusion variations as an occlusion model, which can represent the possible occlusion variations efficiently. Then, the occlusion model is projected by KDA to get the KED, which can be computed via the same kernel trick as new testing samples. Finally, we use structured SRC for classification, which is fast as only a small number of atoms are appended to the basic dictionary, and the feature dimension is low. We also extend KED to multikernel space to fuse different types of features at kernel level. Experiments are done on several large-scale data sets, demonstrating that not only does KED get impressive results for nonoccluded samples, but it also handles the occlusion well without overfitting, even with a single gallery sample per subject.`,doi: `10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2522431`,issn: `21622388`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems`,keywords: `Face occlusion,face recognition,image classification,kernel discriminant analysis (KDA),sparse representation classifier (SRC)`,number: `5`,pages: `1082--1094`,pmid: `26890929`,publisher: `IEEE`,title: `Learning Kernel Extended Dictionary for Face Recognition`,volume: `28`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2017 Learning Kernel Extended Dictionary for Face Recognition - Huang et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged,image classification,#corrupted author,tesse`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,doi: `10.4324/9781315716879`,journal: `Acoustics and Psychoacoustics`,publisher: `Traducao.

Such system captures the smoothed amplitude fluctuation pattern over time, illustrating how energy is distributed across the signal. Although the pulmonic air pressure is the primary energy source of speech, the amplitude modulation pattern is largely determined by articulatory behaviors, especially mandible and lip movements. Therefore, there should be a correspondence between signal envelope kinematics and articulator kinematics. Previous research showed that a tremendous amount of speaker idiosyncrasies in articulation existed. Such idiosyncrasies should therefore be reflected in the envelope kinematics as well. From the signal envelope kinematics, it may be possible to infer individual articulatory behaviors. This is particularly useful for forensic phoneticians who usually have no access to articulatory data, and clinical speech pathologists who usually find it difficult to make articulatory measurements in clinical consultations.`,journal: `The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America`,pages: `107--113`,title: `Amplitude envelope kinematics of speech: Parameter extraction and applications`,url: `https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4987638`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/unused/2017_107_113.pdf`,tags: `speech,temporal envelope`},

The paper presents a case to illustrate the proposed methodology. Design/methodology/approach: The research method is a qualitative and quantitative mixture and it is presented as a study case. Bibliographic research is used to construct the theoretical framework. There are a number of studies that develop a sensibility analysis in MCDA modelling; however, none of them explore the robustness of the MCDA solution with use of scenarios variation. Findings: The methodology allows the criteria that must be taken into account, according to the decision makers' values and preferences. It is interesting to note that, depending on the scenario, different weights were applied for each criterion, and the performances of alternatives under each criterion has changed as well. Practical implications: This need arises in decision problems that are susceptible to the influence of scenario variation. Originality/value: This proposal was applied to a real case that has taken into account six alternatives, with a prospective analysis of three scenarios, evaluated by four criteria. The authors use prospective scenarios to choose the criterion weights and alternatives evaluation.`,doi: `10.1108/JM2-01-2016-0005`,issn: `17465672`,journal: `Journal of Modelling in Management`,keywords: `Decision analysis,MCDA,Multiple criteria,Scenario analysis`,number: `3`,pages: `475--497`,title: `Sensibility analysis of MCDA using prospective in Brazilian energy sector`,volume: `12`,year: `2017`,tags: `#corrupted author,#merged`},

Our algorithm is motivated by the step size limitation of explicit gradient descent, which poses an impediment for optimization. Prox-Prop is developed from a general point of view on the backpropagation algorithm, currently the most common technique to train neural networks via stochastic gradient descent and variants thereof. Specifically, we show that backpropagation of a prediction error is equivalent to sequential gradient descent steps on a quadratic penalty energy, which comprises the network activations as variables of the optimization. We further analyze theoretical properties of ProxProp and in particular prove that the algorithm yields a descent direction in parameter space and can therefore be combined with a wide variety of convergent algorithms. Finally, we devise an efficient numerical implementation that integrates well with popular deep learning frameworks. We conclude by demonstrating promising numerical results and show that ProxProp can be effectively combined with common first order optimizers such as Adam.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1706.04638`,eprint: `1706.04638`,issn: `23318422`,journal: `arXiv`,pages: `1--14`,title: `Proximal backpropagation`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2018 Proximal Backpropagation.pdf`},

Data compression is widely used by the community because through a compression we can save storage. Data compression can also speed up a transmission of data from one person to another. In performing a compression requires a method of data compression that can be used, the method can then be used to compress a data. Data that can be compressed not only text data but can be images and video. Data compression technique is divided into 2 namely lossy compression and lossless compression. But which is often used to perform a compression that is lossless compression. A kind of lossless compressions such as Huffman, Shannon Fano, Tunstall, Lempel Ziv welch and run-length encoding. Each method has the ability to perform a different compression. This paper explains how a method works in doing a compression and explains which method is well used in doing a data compression in the form of text. The output generated in doing a can be known through the compression file size that becomes smaller than the original file.`,issn: `09739769`,journal: `International Journal of Applied Engineering Research`,keywords: `Compression techniques,Data compression,Huffman,LZW,Lossless compression,RLE,Shannon fano,Tunstall`,number: `19`,pages: `8956--8963`,title: `A review of data compression techniques`,volume: `12`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/2017 A Review of Data Compression Techniques - Fitriya et al..pdf`},

  {key: `2017_fano_etal1`,type: `book`,author: `Guido Fano and S M Blinder`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Many years ago, my math teacher assigned me the task to give a presentation to the rest of the class. Time to prepare, 2 weeks; topic, group theory and its application to quantum mechanics. I politely observed that I had not yet had a course on quantum theory; I knew nothing about it. Teacher's reply was: "Well, you study it." His name was Guido Fano. This is how Guido Fano had me learning quantum theory. At home, alone, with a bunch of books on my desk, Dirac's one on top of all. I have been forever grateful to him, for this and much more. If I got into theoretical physics, it's thanks to him, the trust that I found, with surprise, from him. Today, when I realize that there is something that I should know and do not know (which of course happen contin- uously), I hear his voice in my mind saying "Well, you study it." But the second lesson I learned from Guido Fano, both about life and quantum theory, was even more crucial. After my presentation to the class, I thanked him and said: "I have now learned quantum mechanics." His reply was "No you haven't." How true. And not just because a couple of weeks couldn't suffice to digest the theory, but because nearly a century from Heisenberg and Dirac hasn't sufficed the community of us all to come to terms with this theory. In the months after my presentation, I kept discovering, first from Fano himself, and then over and over for the rest of my life, how multifaceted is this theory, and how slippery our actual understanding to it. The more I have learned about the theory, the less clear it has become. When comes the moment of saying what we really have learned about the world in finding that quantum mechanics works so effectively—well, we disagree among ourselves, and there are nearly as many opinions as physicists (not counting the philosophers). Long time later, with this new book on quantum theory, once again Guido Fano, together with his overseas colleague S.M. Blinder, opens up new sides of quantum mechanics for me. The beauty of this book, in my opinion, is that it merges very different traditions of thinking about the theory and teaching it. For a theory still so perplexing, this is what we need; in order to understand it better, to learn it better, but also to learn how to better use it. If had to start again learning quantum theory from scratch, as I did 40 years ago, I would do as I did: at home, alone, with many texts on my desk. But I would certainly have, next to Dirac's one, this book.`,doi: `10.1007/978-3-319-58732-5`,isbn: `9783319587318`,journal: `Program`,publisher: `Springer International Publishing`,series: `UNITEXT for Physics`,shorttitle: `Twenty-First Century Quantum Mechanics`,title: `B-Twenty-First Century Quantum Mechanics: Hilbert Space to Quantum Computers`,year: `2017`,tags: `#merged`},

The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks.

This assertion has been confirmed in recent times by various scholars, who also take into account the large number of musical instruments and the wide range of iconographic evidence that have been found at Etruscan sites, which span from the beginning of the seventh century to the first century BCE. While the only specimens that survive are, of course, those made of nonperishable materials like metal or clay, the iconographic evidence-such as the tomb paintings and other kinds of representations-clearly show that almost all of the musical instruments that were widespread in the Mediterranean at the time were also used in Etruria on many different occasions, including public and private ceremonies, rituals, and daily life. Tantalizing glimpses of the earlier presence of perishable instruments-such as wooden pipes and string instruments-are provided by the surviving parts made of ivory or bone, including a few pipes, joints between pipe and reed, and plectra. One notable feature in the Etruscan context seems to be the complete lack of membranophones-in particular the frame drum-which had still not appeared by the turn of the fifth century, and by which time all of the other musical instruments were already firmly established in the area.`,isbn: `9789811029509`,journal: `Musical Instruments in the 21st Century`,title: `Musical Instruments in the 21st Century`,year: `2017`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Acoustics/2017 Musical Instruments in the 21st Century - Bovermann et al.pdf`},

  {key: `2017_costa_etal1`,type: `article`,translator: ` `,author: `Y Costa and re M.G. and Luiz S. Oliveira and Carlos N. Silla`,editor: ` `,abstract: `Music genre recognition based on visual representation has been successfully explored over the last years. Classifiers trained with textural descriptors (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, and Gabor filters) extracted from the spectrograms have achieved state-of-the-art results on several music datasets. In this work, though, we argue that we can go further with the time-frequency analysis through the use of representation learning. To show that, we compare the results obtained with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the results obtained by using handcrafted features and SVM classifiers. In addition, we have performed experiments fusing the results obtained with learned features and handcrafted features to assess the complementarity between these representations for the music classification task. Experiments were conducted on three music databases with distinct characteristics, specifically a western music collection largely used in research benchmarks (ISMIR 2004 Database), a collection of Latin American music (LMD database), and a collection of field recordings of ethnic African music. Our experiments show that the CNN compares favorably to other classifiers in several scenarios, hence, it is a very interesting alternative for music genre recognition. Considering the African database, the CNN surpassed the handcrafted representations and also the state-of-the-art by a margin. In the case of the LMD database, the combination of CNN and Robust Local Binary Pattern achieved a recognition rate of 92%, which to the best of our knowledge, is the best result (using an artist filter) on this dataset so far. On the ISMIR 2004 dataset, although the CNN did not improve the state of the art, it performed better than the classifiers based individually on other kind of features.`,doi: `10.1016/j.asoc.2016.12.024`,issn: `15684946`,journal: `Applied Soft Computing Journal`,keywords: `Music genre recognition,Neural network applications,Pattern recognition,music classification,state of the art`,pages: `28--38`,publisher: `Elsevier B.V.`,title: `An evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks for music classification using spectrograms`,url: `http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1568494616306421`,volume: `52`,year: `2017`,tags: `state of the art,music classification`},

This means that inputs that have an imperceptibly and immeasurably small difference from training data correspond to a completely different class label in deep learning. Thus an existing deep learning network like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is vulnerable to adversarial examples. We design an adversarial learning algorithm for supervised learning in general and CNNs in particular. Adversarial examples are generated by a game theoretic formulation on the performance of deep learning. In the game, the interaction between an intelligent adversary and deep learning model is a two-person sequential noncooperative Stackelberg game with stochastic payoff functions. The Stackelberg game is solved by the Nash equilibrium which is a pair of strategies (learner weights and genetic operations) from which there is no incentive for either learner or adversary to deviate. The algorithm performance is evaluated under different strategy spaces on MNIST handwritten digits data.

However, the real challenge is to create new materials from food waste and not from specially grown crops, whose production in any case comes at an environmental cost. In recent years, the testing of substances made from food waste has increased significantly; the sheer abundance of raw materials that can be used to make them has encouraged institutional research, as well as an approach to project development that has been widely embraced by the many young designers who craft these materials. This paper considers all aspects of these materials, starting from a historical overview.

We present a framework for designers to better understand how materials change with use, and in turn how people respond to materials as they change. Key challenges are identified which must be overcome to use this framework in design practice–people's physical interaction with objects is poorly understood, it is difficult to simulate material change, materials resources for designers do not provide information about material change, and people's responses to aged materials depend on a complex web of interacting factors.`,doi: `10.1080/14606925.2017.1352715`,issn: `14606925`,journal: `Design Journal`,keywords: `cosmetic obsolescence,degradation,graceful ageing,material change,patina`,number: `sup1`,pages: `S160----S171`,title: `Design for Next/ldotsYear.

The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1611.01704`,eprint: `1611.01704`,journal: `5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017 - Conference Track Proceedings`,title: `End-to-end optimized image compression`,year: `2017`},

In all of these challenges, we have limited security resources that prevent full security coverage at all times. Instead, limited security resources must be deployed intelligently, taking into account differences in priorities of targets requiring security coverage, the responses of adversaries to the security posture, and potential uncertainty over the types, capabilities, knowledge, and priorities of adversaries faced. Game theory is well suited to adversarial reasoning for security resource allocation and scheduling problems. Casting the problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game in consideration of uncertainties, we have developed new algorithms for efficiently solving such games to provide randomized patrolling or inspection strategies. These algorithms have led to some initial successes in this arena, leading to advances over previous approaches in security resource scheduling and allocation, e.g., by addressing key weaknesses of predictability of human schedulers. These algorithms are now deployed in multiple applications: ARMOR has been deployed at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) since 2007 to randomize checkpoints on the roadways entering the airport and canine patrol routes within the airport terminals (Pita et al., 2008); IRIS is a game-theoretic scheduler for randomized deployment of the U.S. Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) requiring significant scale-up in underlying algorithms that has been in use since 2009 (Tsai, Rathi, Kiekintveld, Ord/'o/~nez, & Tambe, 2009); and PROTECT, which requires further scale-up, is deployed for generating randomized patrol schedules for the U.S. Coast Guard in Boston, New York, Los Angeles, and other ports around the United States (An et al., 2013; An, Pita, Shieh, Tambe, Kiekintveld, & Marecki, 2011; Shieh et al., 2012). Furthermore, TRUSTS is being evaluated for deterring fare evasion, suppressing urban crime, and counterterrorism within the Los Angeles Metro System (Jiang, Nguyen, Tambe, & Procaccia, 2013; Zin & Tambe, 2012), and GUARDS was earlier tested by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for security inside the airport (Pita, Tambe, Kiekintveld, Cullen, & Steigerwald, 2011).`,doi: `10.1017/9781316676714.021`,edition: `1`,isbn: `9781316676714`,journal: `Improving Homeland Security Decisions`,keywords: `game theory`,pages: `485--507`,publisher: `Cambridge University Press`,title: `Stackelberg security games (SSG) basics and application overview`,url: `https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781316676714///////%5C%5C%23CN-bp-21/type/book///////%5C%5C_part`,year: `2017`,tags: `game theory`},

Unfortunately, limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times; instead, we must optimize the use of limited security resources. To that end, we founded the "security games" framework to build decision-aids for security agencies. Security games is a novel area of research that is based on computational and behavioral game theory, while also incorporating elements of AI planning under uncertainty and machine learning. We have deployed securitygames based decision aids for infrastructure security such as at the ports and ferry trafﬁc with the US coast guard (in the ports of New York, Boston, Los Angeles/Long Beach, Houston and others), for security of airports and air trafﬁc with the US Federal Air Marshals and the Los Angeles World Airport (LAX) police, and tested this framework for security of metro trains with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department. Moreover, recent work on "green security games" has led to testing our decision aids for protection of ﬁsheries with the US Coast Guard and protection of wildlife at sites in multiple countries, and opportunistic crime security games have focused on suppressing urban crime. This chapter will discuss applications of security games, and outline research challenges in security games including algorithms for scaling up security games as well as for handling signiﬁcant adversarial uncertainty and learning models of human adversary behaviors.`,doi: `10.1017/9781316676714.021`,edition: `1`,isbn: `9781316676714`,journal: `Improving Homeland Security Decisions`,langid: `english`,pages: `485--507`,publisher: `Cambridge University Press`,title: `Stackelberg Security Games (SSG) Basics and Application Overview`,url: `https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781316676714/////////%23CN-bp-21/type/book/////////_part`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,year: `2017`,tags: `game theory`},

In most real environments, criteria and their constraints are not deterministic and cannot be specified precisely; therefore, those criteria are uncertain or fuzzy. To facilitate the selection of an appropriate MCDM method under a fuzzy environment, this study investigates and statistically compares the performances of ten commonly used MCDM techniques: simple additive weights (SAW), weighted product method (WPM), compromise programming (CP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), four types of analytical hierarchy process (AHP), VIKOR (in Serbian: VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje), and ELECTRE (in French: ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalit/'e). These techniques' performances were compared using fuzzy criteria and constraints, matching the conditions usually found in real applications. To conduct the comparisons, the 10 multi-criteria decision ranking methods were applied to 1250 simulated sets of decision matrices with fuzzy triangular values, and 12,500 sets of ranks were analyzed to compare the ranking methods. SAW and TOPSIS had statistically similar performances. ELECTRE was not preferable in providing full, sorted ranks among the alternatives. VIKOR considering its ranking process, for specific conditions, assigns identical ranks for several alternatives; when full, sorted ranks are required, VIKOR is unfavorable, although it is a powerful technique in introducing the closest alternative to the ideal condition.

However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN.

The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can achieve signiﬁcantly better performance on SPSS than deep feedforward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e.g., input gate, output gate, forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simpliﬁed architecture. The simpliﬁed architecture has signiﬁcantly fewer parameters than an LSTM, thus reducing generation complexity considerably without degrading quality.`,eprint: `1601.02539`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1601.02539 [cs]`,langid: `english`,title: `Investigating gated recurrent neural networks for speech synthesis`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02539`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,year: `2016`,tags: `tesse`},

However, their storage and computational requirements have largely prevented their widespread use on mobile devices. Here we present an effective CNN compression approach in the frequency domain, which focuses not only on smaller weights but on all the weights and their underlying connections. By treating convolutional filters as images, we decompose their representations in the frequency domain as common parts (i.e., cluster centers) shared by other similar filters and their individual private parts (i.e., individual residuals). A large number of low-energy frequency coefficients in both parts can be discarded to produce high compression without significantly compromising accuracy. We relax the computational burden of convolution operations in CNNs by linearly combining the convolution responses of discrete cosine transform (DCT) bases.

The low-redshift mitigates, to some extent, the effect of beam smearing which artificially inflates the measured dispersion as it combines regions with different line-of-sight velocities into a single spatial pixel. We compare the parametric maps of the velocity dispersion with the H\$/alpha\$ flux (a proxy for local star-formation rate), and the velocity gradient (a proxy for the local effect of beam smearing). We find, even for these very nearby galaxies, the H\$/alpha\$ velocity dispersion correlates more strongly with velocity gradient than with H\$/alpha\$ flux—implying that beam smearing is still having a significant effect on the velocity dispersion measurements. We obtain a first-order non parametric correction for the unweighted and flux weighted mean velocity dispersion by fitting a 2D linear regression model to the spaxel-by-spaxel data where the velocity gradient and the H\$/alpha\$ flux are the independent variables and the velocity dispersion is the dependent variable; and then extrapolating to zero velocity gradient.

In the first case, eight people with normal vision and no motor disability participated in a music-playing session in which both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. In the second case 31 people qualitatively evaluated the EyeHarp in a concert setting consisting of two parts: a solo performance part, and an ensemble (EyeHarp, two guitars, and flute) performance part.

Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will significantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional LSTM recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efficient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32\$/times\$32 thumbnails, our LSTM-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) JPEG, JPEG2000 and WebP, with a storage size that is reduced by 10% or more.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1511.06085`,eprint: `1511.06085`,journal: `4th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2016 - Conference Track Proceedings`,keywords: `image compression- lossy`,pages: `1--12`,title: `Variable rate image compression with recurrent neural networks`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06085`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/2016 Variable Rate Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Networks - Toderici et al..pdf`,tags: `#corrupted author,image compression- lossy`},

In this paper, a blind image quality assessment method for stereoscopic images is proposed via deep learning. The proposed method is composed of two stages: training and testing. In the training stage, Gabor filter is applied to the left and right distorted images respectively, and natural statistical features under different scales and directions are extracted to act as monocular features. Then, left and right images are fused to construct a cyclopean map, and histograms of oriented gradient features are extracted from the cyclopean map to act as binocular features. Finally, a regression model between features and subjective scores is established via deep belief network. In the testing stage, based on the established regression model, left and right image quality scores are predicted and fused to get the final stereoscopic image quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for both symmetrical and asymmetrical stereoscopic image databases, and can achieve high consistent alignment with subjective assessment.`,issn: `10039775`,journal: `Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao/Journal of Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics`,keywords: `Cyclopean map,Deep learning,Gabor filtering,Quality assessment,Stereoscopic image,image classification,sentiment analysis`,number: `6`,pages: `968--975`,publisher: `IEEE`,title: `Blind image quality assessment for stereoscopic images via deep learning`,volume: `28`,year: `2016`,tags: `sentiment analysis,image classification`},

This is largely because conventional optimization algorithms rely on stochastic gradient methods that don't scale well to large numbers of cores in a cluster setting. Furthermore, the convergence of all gradient methods, including batch methods, suffers from common problems like saturation effects, poor conditioning, and saddle points. This paper explores an unconventional training method that uses alternating direction methods and Bregman iteration to train networks without gradient descent steps. The proposed method reduces the network training problem to a sequence of minimization sub-steps that can each be solved globally in closed form. The proposed method is advantageous because it avoids many of the caveats that make gradient methods slow on highly non-convex problems. The method exhibits strong scaling in the distributed setting, yielding linear speedups even when split over thousands of cores.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1605.02026`,eprint: `1605.02026`,title: `Training Neural Networks Without Gradients: A Scalable ADMM Approach`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02026`,volume: `48`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2016 Training Neural Networks Without Gradients A Scalable ADMM Approach.pdf`},

The fast estimation of fundamental frequencies with low error rate and simple implementation is interesting for real-time speech signal processing.`,doi: `10.1186/s13636-016-0095-8`,issn: `16874722`,journal: `Eurasip Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing`,keywords: `Autocorrelation,Fundamental frequency,Pitch detection`,number: `1`,pages: `0--7`,publisher: `EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing`,title: `Fast fundamental frequency determination via adaptive autocorrelation`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13636-016-0095-8`,volume: `2016`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2016 Fast fundamental frequency determination via adaptive autocorrelation - Staudacher et al.pdf`},

Neural networks have already been shown to perform well in fields related to ADT such as source separation and onset detection due to their utilisation of time-series data in classification. We propose the use of neural networks for ADT in order to exploit their ability to capture a complex configuration of features associated with individual or combined drum classes. In this paper we present a bi-directional recurrent neural network for offline detection of percussive onsets from specified drum classes and a recurrent neural network suitable for online operation. In both systems, a separate network is trained to identify onsets for each drum class under observation—that is, kick drum, snare drum, hi-hats, and combinations thereof. We perform four evaluations utilising the IDMT-SMT-Drums and ENST minus one datasets, which cover solo percussion and polyphonic audio respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods for solo percussion and a capacity for identifying snare drums, which are historically the most difficult drum class to detect.`,isbn: `9780692755068`,journal: `Proceedings of the 17th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR 2016`,keywords: `music transcription,tesis`,pages: `591--597`,title: `Automatic drum transcription using bi-directional recurrent neural networks`,url: `http://www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk/4101/`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Music/Transcription/2016SouthallAutomatic Automatic Drum Transcription Using Bi Directional Recurrent Neural Networks.pdf`,tags: `thesis,#merged,music transcription`},

You will also need a course ID from your instructor to access MyOMLab. Operations management is important, exciting, challenging … and everywhere you look! Important, because it enables organizations to provide services and products that we all need Exciting, because it is central to constant changes in customer preference, networks of supply and demand, and developments in technology Challenging, because solutions must be must be financially sound, resource-efficient, as well as environmentally and socially responsible And everywhere, because in our daily lives, whether at work or at home, we all experience and manage processes and operations. New features: There are now more than 110 of the popular ‘Operations in Practice’ examples throughout the book, over 40 ///% of which are new. The importance of sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been emphasized further, and included throughout the book. We have even further strengthened the emphasis on the idea that ‘operations management’ is relevant to every type of business and all functional areas of the organization. Many new ideas in operations management have been incorporated, including the ‘three level’ approach to performance, the relationship between innovation, creativity and design, crowdsourcing, ideas management, business ecosystems, triadic relationships, office layout, telecommuting and organisational ‘ambidexterity’. However, we have retained the emphasis on the foundations of the subject. Six of the 19 cases at the end of the chapter are new (but the old ones are still available on the web site), and provide an up-to-date selection of operations issues. Operations Management focuses on the sustainable and socially responsible imperatives of operations management, using over 120 cases and illustrations of real-life operations around the world, including Apple, Médecins Sans Frontières, Amazon, Ecover, Dyson, Disneyland Paris, Google, The North Face, and many more.

UTA methodology uses linear programming techniques in order to optimally infer additive value/utility functions, so that these functions are as consistent as possible with the global decision-maker's preferences (inference principle). The main objective of this chapter is to analytically present the UTA method and its variants and to summarize the progress made in this field. The historical background and the philosophy of the aggregation-disaggregation approach are firstly given. The detailed presentation of the basic UTA algorithm is presented, including discussion on the stability and sensitivity analyses. Several variants of the UTA method, which incorporate different forms of optimality criteria, are also discussed. The implementation of the UTA methods is illustrated by a general overview of UTA-based DSSs, as well as real-world decision-making applications. Finally, several potential future research developments are discussed.`,doi: `10.1007/978-1-4939-3094-4_9`,isbn: `9780387230672`,issn: `08848289`,journal: `International Series in Operations Research and Management Science`,keywords: `Additive utility,Multicriteria analysis,Ordinal regression,Preference disaggregation,UTA methods`,pages: `315--362`,publisher: `Springer-Verlag`,title: `UTA methods`,volume: `233`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/allocate/2005 UTA Methods - Siskos et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0.

This exploratory study is one of the first consumer studies in the field of bio-based research. Three focus group discussions were organized in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands (with 89 participants in total) in which projective techniques were applied. Results of these group discussions indicate that participants are unfamiliar with 'bio-based' as a concept. 'Bio-based' is most often associated with positive environmental issues as "naturalness" and "environmental friendly" but also with negative environmental associations and to a lesser extent with technological and health issues. Associations with 'bio-based' as a general concept and with particular bio-based products can be simultaneously positive and negative, which caused uncertainty and mixed feelings by the respondents. This idea highlights both the complexity of and a lack of familiarity with the concept of 'bio-based'. Consumers have a holistic perception of bio-based products, i.e., they combine their perception of different aspects of the product in an evaluation of the whole product concept (e.g., their perception of the original product, usability, production method, proportion of bio-based materials used, price, packaging material, and appearance). Discussions on 'bio-based' as a concept are more general and abstract, while discussions and associations related to bio-based products are more specific.

Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture, we propose a "fabric" that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size.

Neural networks are a key element of deep learning and artificial intelligence, which today is capable of some truly impressive feats. Yet too few really understand how neural networks actually work. This guide will take you on a fun and unhurried journey, starting from very simple ideas, and gradually building up an understanding of how neural networks work. You won't need any mathematics beyond secondary school, and an accessible introduction to calculus is also included. The ambition of this guide is to make neural networks as accessible as possible to as many readers as possible - there are enough texts for advanced readers already!You'll learn to code in Python and make your own neural network, teaching it to recognise human handwritten numbers, and performing as well as professionally developed networks. Part 1 is about ideas. We introduce the mathematical ideas underlying the neural networks, gently with lots of illustrations and examples. Part 2 is practical. We introduce the popular and easy to learn Python programming language, and gradually builds up a neural network which can learn to recognise human handwritten numbers, easily getting it to perform as well as networks made by professionals. Part 3 extends these ideas further. We push the performance of our neural network to an industry leading 98 ///% using only simple ideas and code, test the network on your own handwriting, take a privileged peek inside the mysterious mind of a neural network, and even get it all working on a Raspberry Pi.

As the number of players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase their ﬁnal rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to ﬁnd a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov Games. In this paper, we introduce a new deﬁnition of ǫ-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy’s quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellmanlike residuals implies to learn such an ǫ-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the Lp norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium in generic multiplayer generalsum turn-based MGs.`,eprint: `1606.08718`,eprintclass: `cs`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,langid: `english`,title: `Learning Nash Equilibrium for General-Sum Markov Games from Batch Data`,year: `2016`,tags: `game theory`},

Internet statistics show that on an average, for every 500 individuals who read the title of a research paper, only one is likely to read the complete paper. One might wonder: Does the title of the paper have anything to do with these readership numbers? Old research, in the form of the work of peers or contemporaries, usually forms the basis for new research. While it is common to browse and shortlist relevant papers from a searchable database, researchers or students may also come across a relevant research topic either in the contents section of a journal or in the references list of a paper. One can therefore say that the title of a paper directly affects the impact or visibility of a work, or that it is one of the factors that can affect the readership of a journal. Although the impact of the results (or conclusion) is reason enough for a work to be read and further cited, the title of a research paper is equally important in generating reader interest and providing the right exposure or visibility.`,pages: `1--6`,title: `Writing an`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/Writing An Interpreter In Go - Ball.pdf`},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

Therefore, in the past decade, a number of major industries, such as the automotive, construction and packaging industries, have shown a considerable interest in the progress of new natural fiber reinforced composite materials. The availability of natural fibers and the ease of manufacturing have tempted researchers to study their feasibility of their application as reinforcement and the extent to which they satisfy the required specifications in tribological applications. However, less information concerning the tribological performance of natural fiber reinforced composite material is available in the literature. Hence, the aim of this bibliographic review is to demonstrate the tribological behavior of natural fiber reinforced composites and find a knowledge about their usability for various applications that tribology plays a dominant role. This review presents the reported work on natural fiber reinforced composites with special reference to the type of fibers, matrix polymers, treatment of fibers and test parameters. The results show that composites reinforced with natural fibers have an improvement in tribological properties and their properties are comparable with conventional fibers. In addition, fiber treatment and fiber orientation are two important factors can affect tribological properties where treated fibers and normal oriented fibers exhibit better friction and wear behavior. This review is trying to evaluate the effect of test parameter including normal load and sliding speed on tribological properties, and the results vary based on type of reinforcement. Generally, due to their positive economic and environmental aspects, as well as their good tribological properties, natural composites are showing a good potential for employing in several applications.`,doi: `10.1016/j.jestch.2015.10.007`,issn: `22150986`,journal: `Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal`,keywords: `Biodegradability,Friction,Green materials,Natural fiber,Polymer composite,Tribology,Wear`,number: `2`,pages: `717--736`,title: `State of the art on tribological behavior of polymer matrix composites reinforced with natural fibers in the green materials world`,url: `https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S221509861500172X`,volume: `19`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/Biocomposites/2016 state of the art on tribological behavior of polymer matrix composites - omrani et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

However, the use of sensors, communications, computational capacity and control to increase and improve the power system functionalities, concept known as Smart Grid (SG), has great potential to revolutionize the electric sector. Nonetheless, many difficulties emerge when implementing SG technologies in a large scale. These difficulties may be technical, financial, environmental, regulatory and managerial. In order to aid in this process, the goal of this research is to propose a novel approach on how to assess the performance of SG implementation projects. The approach is based on the multicriteria decision aid theory, specifically using the Multicriteria Decision Aid Constructive Approach (MCDA-C), due to its logical and data treatment structures. A case study to evaluate the MCDA-C application was conducted, in partnership with a local utility SG pilot-project. With the use of this novel approach, it was possible to build a quantitative roadmap to monitor and improve the project performance. The main contribution of this work is the novel approach proposed, an adaptive model based on a multicriteria decision aid method that can comprehensively assess the performance of any SG project.`,doi: `10.1109/TLA.2016.7530428`,issn: `15480992`,journal: `IEEE Latin America Transactions`,keywords: `Multicriteria Decision Aid,Project Management,Roadmap,Smart Grids`,number: `5`,pages: `2316--2322`,title: `Smart Grid Performance Assessment Via Multicriteria Decision Aid Constructive Approach Method`,volume: `14`,year: `2016`,tags: `#merged`},

A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the weights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with the weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact, random feedback weights work evenly well, because the network learns how to make the feedback useful. In this work, the feedback alignment principle is used for training hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network, and from a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random feedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This simple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional networks and very deep networks, completely without error back-propagation. The method is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the error signal is almost local, and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are required. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is almost as good as those obtained with back-propagation for fully connected networks. If combined with dropout, the method achieves 1.45% error on the permutation invariant MNIST task.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1609.01596`,eprint: `1609.01596`,issn: `10495258`,journal: `Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems`,number: `Nips`,pages: `1045--1053`,title: `Direct feedback alignment provides learning in deep neural networks`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2016 Direct Feedback Alignment Provides Learning in Deep Neural Networks.pdf`},

Moore and Aleks Sek`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `Multichannel amplitude compression is widely used in hearing aids. The preferred compression speed varies across individuals. Moore (2008) suggested that reduced sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) may be associated with preference for slow compression. This idea was tested using a simulated hearing aid. It was also assessed whether preferences for compression speed depend on the type of stimulus: speech or music. Twenty-two hearing-impaired subjects were tested, and the stimulated hearing aid was fitted individually using the CAM2A method. On each trial, a given segment of speech or music was presented twice. One segment was processed with fast compression and the other with slow compression, and the order was balanced across trials. The subject indicated which segment was preferred and by how much. On average, slow compression was preferred over fast compression, more so for music, but there were distinct individual differences, which were highly correlated for speech and music. Sensitivity to TFS was assessed using the difference limen for frequency at 2000 Hz and by two measures of sensitivity to interaural phase at low frequencies. The results for the difference limens for frequency, but not the measures of sensitivity to interaural phase, supported the suggestion that preference for compression speed is affected by sensitivity to TFS.`,doi: `10.1177/2331216516640486`,isbn: `2331216516640`,issn: `23312165`,journal: `Trends in Hearing`,keywords: `compression speed,hearing aids,temporal fine structure`,pages: `1--15`,pmid: `27604778`,title: `Preferred Compression Speed for Speech and Music and Its Relationship to Sensitivity to Temporal Fine Structure`,volume: `20`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/unused/2331216516640486.pdf`,tags: `speech,sound compression,temporal envelope,music`},

Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus. The objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some field, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. To do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in WoS (13,605 journals) and Scopus (20,346 journals) with Ulrich's extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. These results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, WoS and Scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different fields, institutions, countries or languages. The bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientific output that are not covered in WoS or Scopus, such as field-specific and national citation indexes.`,doi: `10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5`,issn: `15882861`,journal: `Scientometrics`,keywords: `Bibliometrics,Citation indexes,Research evaluation,Scopus,Web of Science`,number: `1`,pages: `213--228`,title: `The journal coverage of Web of Science and Scopus: a comparative analysis`,volume: `106`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Bibliometry/2016 The Journal Coverage of Web of Science and Scopus_a Comparative Analysis  2016Mongeonjournal.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but complicates learning because it is difficult to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all the synaptic weights on each neuron's axon and further downstream. However, this involves a precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we demonstrate that this strong architectural constraint is not required for effective error propagation. We present a surprisingly simple mechanism that assigns blame by multiplying errors by even random synaptic weights. This mechanism can transmit teaching signals across multiple layers of neurons and performs as effectively as backpropagation on a variety of tasks. Our results help reopen questions about how the brain could use error signals and dispel long-held assumptions about algorithmic constraints on learning.`,doi: `10.1038/ncomms13276`,issn: `20411723`,journal: `Nature Communications`,pages: `1--10`,pmid: `27824044`,publisher: `Nature Publishing Group`,title: `Random synaptic feedback weights support error backpropagation for deep learning`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13276`,volume: `7`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2016 Random synaptic feedback weights support error backpropagation for deep learning.pdf`},

In its simplest form, the process involves finding the spectral peaks. When higher frequency resolution is required, a frequency offset can be found from the interpolation of DFT coefficients. However, most of the past researches focus on monotonic cisoid signals. In practical situations where multiple harmonics are present, the sidelobes from other harmonics interfere with the estimation of the harmonic being considered. In this case, windows with smaller sidelobes such as Hanning window are preferred over rectangular window. Given the increased mathematical complexity of Hanning window, analytical solution has not yet been available for DFT interpolation. In this paper, we derive an exact analytical solution of the estimated frequency from DFT interpolation of Hanning windowed signal. In experiments, we show that the new analytical solution is accurate for monotonic cisoid signal and can considerably reduce the effect of interharmonic interference as compared to previous rectangular windowed methods.`,doi: `10.1109/ISCIT.2015.7458336`,isbn: `9781467368209`,journal: `2015 15th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies, ISCIT 2015`,number: `4`,pages: `177--180`,title: `Analytical solution of DFT interpolated frequency estimator for Hanning windowed signal`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Harmonic Analysis/2015 Analytical Solution of DFT Interpolated Frequency Estimator for Hanning Windowed Signal_2015LiaoAnalytical.pdf`},

In our experiments every generalized pooling operation we explore improves performance when used in place of average or max pooling. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pooling operations provide a boost in invariance properties relative to conventional pooling and set the state of the art on several widely adopted benchmark datasets; they are also easy to implement, and can be applied within various deep neural network architectures.

In both types of games, several antagonistic agents interact with each other over time. The difference is that, in a multistage game, there is a dynamic system whose state keeps changing: the controls chosen by the agents in the current period affect the system’s future. In contrast with repeated games, the agents’ payoffs in multistage games depend directly on the state of this system. Examples of such settings range from a microeconomic dynamic model of a ﬁsh biomass exploited by several agents to a macroeconomic interaction between the government and the business sector. In some multistage games, physically different decisionmakers engage in simultaneous-move competition. In others, agents execute their actions sequentially rather than simultaneously. We also study hierarchical games, where a leader moves ahead of a follower.

In particular, it examines two case studies-virtual orchestral instruments and virtual singing instruments-to consider how their design and implementation seek to express human music performance by adopting the micro and macro sonic variations of timing, pitch, dynamics, articulation, ambience, and other limitations imposed by the physical relationship between the player and the instrument. Baudrillard considers that "simulation threatens the difference between the 'true' and the 'false', the 'real' and the 'imaginary'" (1994: 3). By feigning the acoustic markers of expressive human musical performance, virtual instrument designers and composer-users encourage the listener to produce, in themselves, the experience of hearing an orchestra or singer. Users also contribute to the recontextualization of human performance by feeding back into the cultures and development cycles of virtual instrument software, where sonic gestures are recurrently refreshed. The construction of virtual instruments as devices of musical expressivity is, therefore, an evolving, mutually constructed, and performative endeavour.`,doi: `10.5429/2079-3871(2016)v6i2.3en`,issn: `20793871`,journal: `IASPM Journal`,keywords: `Musical Expressivity,Performativity,Simulation,Synthesizers,Virtual Instruments,Virtual Orchestras,Vocaloid`,number: `2`,pages: `22--48`,title: `Feigning humanity: Virtual instruments, simulation and performativity`,volume: `6`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/DMI/2016 Feigning Humanity Virtual Instruments, Simulation and Performativity - Klein.pdf`},

The proposed Bitwise Neural Network (BNN) is especially suitable for resource-constrained environments, since it replaces either floating or fixed-point arithmetic with significantly more efficient bitwise operations. Hence, the BNN requires for less spatial complexity, less memory bandwidth, and less power consumption in hardware. In order to design such networks, we propose to add a few training schemes, such as weight compression and noisy backpropagation, which result in a bitwise network that performs almost as well as its corresponding real-valued network. We test the proposed network on the MNIST dataset, represented using binary features, and show that BNNs result in competitive performance while offering dramatic computational savings.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1601.06071`,eprint: `1601.06071`,title: `Bitwise Neural Networks`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06071`,volume: `37`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/binary nns/2015 Bitwise Neural Networks.pdf`},

All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one’s future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass – amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.`,eprint: `1608.05343`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1608.05343 [cs]`,langid: `english`,title: `Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343`,urldate: `2019-03-26`,year: `2016`,tags: `tesse`},

Propagating through the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer must sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward propagation which equates to O(N2n2) per kernel per layer where the inputs are N × N arrays and the kernels are n × n arrays. Convolution can be efﬁciently performed as a Hadamard product in the frequency domain. The bottleneck is the transformation which has a cost of O(N2 log2 N) using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, the increase in efﬁciency is less signiﬁcant when N n as is the case in CNNs. We mitigate this by using the "overlap-and-add" technique reducing the computational complexity to O(N2 log2 n) per kernel. This method increases the algorithm’s efﬁciency in both the forward and backward propagation, reducing the training and testing time for CNNs. Our empirical results show our method reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16.3 times the traditional convolution implementation for a 8 × 8 kernel and a 224 × 224 image.`,eprint: `1601.06815`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1601.06815 [cs]`,langid: `english`,title: `Very Efficient Training of Convolutional Neural Networks using Fast Fourier Transform and Overlap-and-Add`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06815`,urldate: `2019-03-26`,year: `2016`},

We show that both the data source and the speciﬁc metrics used change the conclusions that can be drawn from cross-disciplinary comparisons.`,doi: `10.1007/s11192-015-1798-9`,issn: `0138-9130`,journal: `Scientometrics`,langid: `english`,number: `2`,pages: `787--804`,shorttitle: `Google Scholar, Scopus and the Web of Science`,title: `Google Scholar, Scopus and the Web of Science: a longitudinal and cross-disciplinary comparison`,urldate: `2019-04-07`,volume: `106`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Bibliometry/2016 Google Scholar, Scopus and the Web of Science_a Longitudinal and Cross Disciplinary Comparison  2016HarzingGoogle.pdf`,tags: `#merged,bibliometry,#corrupted author`},
  {key: `2016_han_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Song Han and Huizi Mao and William J. Dally`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce "deep compression", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35× to 49× without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9× to 13×; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35×, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49× from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3× to 4× layerwise speedup and 3× to 7× better energy efficiency.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1510.00149`,eprint: `1510.00149`,journal: `4th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2016 - Conference Track Proceedings`,pages: `1--14`,title: `Deep compression: Compressing deep neural networks with pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/pruning ANNs/2016 DEEP COMPRESSION COMPRESSING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS WITH PRUNING, TRAINED QUANTIZATION AND HUFFMAN CODING.pdf`},

We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. DeepBach’s strength comes from the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the MuseScore music editor making the interaction with DeepBach easy to use.`,arxivid: `1612.01010v2`,eprint: `1612.01010`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1612.01010 [cs]`,langid: `english`,shorttitle: `DeepBach`,title: `DeepBach: a Steerable Model for Bach Chorales Generation`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01010`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,year: `2016`,tags: `tesse`},

This representation is more general than the binary tree representation and, therefore, it introduces new FFT algorithms that were not discovered before. Furthermore, the new representation has the advantage that it is simple and easy to understand, as each FFT algorithm only consists of a triangular matrix. Besides, the new representation allows for obtaining the exact twiddle factor values in the FFT flow graph easily. This facilitates the design of FFT hardware architectures. As a result, the triangular matrix representation is an excellent alternative to represent FFT algorithms and it opens new possibilities in the exploration and understanding of the FFT.`,doi: `10.1109/TCSI.2016.2587822`,issn: `15498328`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers`,keywords: `Binary tree,Cooley-Tukey,fast Fourier transform (FFT)`,number: `10`,pages: `1737--1745`,title: `A New Representation of FFT Algorithms Using Triangular Matrices`,volume: `63`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Harmonic Analysis/FFT/2016 A New Representation of FFT Algorithms Using Triangular Matrices - Garrido.pdf`},

Besides supporting validated learning, MVPs are used to facilitate product design, to bridge communication gaps and to facilitate cost-effective product development activities. Entrepreneurs should consider a systematic approach to fully explore the value of MVP, as a multiple facet product (MFP).

In the pre-training stage, we train the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In the refining stage, we append fully- connected layers to the pre-trained convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly.

The main benefit from these energy sources is maintaining greenhouse gas emissions at low levels. Nevertheless, high penetration of these energy sources into the power mix can lead to many problems, for instance, intermittency in power generation. There are some mechanisms which can be implemented to mitigate intermittency and allow a higher level of participation of these energy sources in the generation mix. One such mechanism is utilizing Energy Storage Systems (ESS). The goal of this paper is to perform a study to find the best ESS options using Multi-criteria Decision Analysis. Moreover, an examination regarding Hydro Power Plants' reservoirs as an ESS is accomplished through a case study using three of Brazils significant Hydro Power Plants.`,doi: `10.1109/TLA.2016.7459613`,issn: `15480992`,journal: `IEEE Latin America Transactions`,keywords: `Energy Storage Systems,Intermittent Sources,Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis,Power Mix,Renewable Sources`,number: `3`,pages: `1302--1307`,title: `Reliability of Electricity Supply Regarding the Integration of Intermittent Sources in Brazil's Power Mix`,volume: `14`,year: `2016`,tags: `#merged`},

The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.`,doi: `10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2514368`,isbn: `216223882162237`,issn: `21622388`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems`,keywords: `Deep learning,Recommender systems (RSs),Social network,Trust,social recommendations`,number: `February`,pages: `1164--1177`,pmid: `26915135`,title: `On Deep Learning for Trust-Aware Recommendations in Social Networks`,volume: `28`,year: `2016`,tags: `social recommendations`},

We introduce the notion of a computation skeleton, an acyclic graph that succinctly describes both a family of neural networks and a kernel space. Random neural networks are generated from a skeleton through node replication followed by sampling from a normal distribution to assign weights. The kernel space consists of functions that arise by compositions, averaging, and non-linear transformations governed by the skeleton's graph topology and activation functions. We prove that random networks induce representations which approximate the kernel space. In particular, it follows that random weight initialization often yields a favorable starting point for optimization despite the worst-case intractability of training neural networks.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1602.05897`,eprint: `1602.05897`,issn: `10495258`,journal: `Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems`,number: `Nips`,pages: `2261--2269`,title: `Toward deeper understanding of neural networks: The power of initialization and a dual view on expressivity`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/ANNs&Sustainability/2016 Toward Deeper Understanding of Neural Networks The Power of Initialization and a Dual View on Expressivity.pdf`},

Though their presence has been difficult to adequately ascertain, due to the inherent technical difficulties for isolating and quantifying them, there is an overall consensus that these are not only present in the environment - either directly released or as the result of weathering of larger fragments - but that they also pose a significant threat to the environment and human health, as well. The reduced size of these particulates (<1 \$/mu\$m) makes them susceptible of ingestion by organisms that are at the base of the food-chain. Moreover, the characteristic high surface area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles may add to their potential hazardous effects, as other contaminants, such as persistent organic pollutants, could be adsorbed and undergo bioaccumulation and bioamplification phenomena. In this review, we describe the most relevant sources of nanoplastics and offer some insights into their fate once released into the environment. Furthermore, we overviewthemost prominent effects of these small particulates, while identifying the key challenges scientists currently face in the research of nanoplastics in the environment.

Today, we know that our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes. This concept of neuroplasticity has captured the imagination of a public eager for self-improvement―and has inspired countless Internet entrepreneurs who peddle dubious "brain training" games and apps. In this book, Moheb Costandi offers a concise and engaging overview of neuroplasticity for the general reader, describing how our brains change continuously in response to our actions and experiences.Costandi discusses key experimental findings, and describes how our thinking about the brain has evolved over time. He explains how the brain changes during development, and the "synaptic pruning" that takes place before brain maturity. He shows that adult brains can grow new cells (citing, among many other studies, research showing that sexually mature male canaries learn a new song every year). He describes the kind of brain training that can bring about improvement in brain function. It's not gadgets and games that promise to "rewire your brain" but such sustained cognitive tasks as learning a musical instrument or a new language. (Costandi also notes that London cabbies increase their gray matter after rigorous training in their city's complicated streets.) He tells how brains compensate after stroke or injury; describes addiction and pain as maladaptive forms of neuroplasticity; and considers brain changes that accompany childhood, adolescence, parenthood, and aging. Each of our brains is custom-built. Neuroplasticity is at the heart of what makes us human.`,isbn: `9780262529334`,location: `Cambridge, MA`,pagetotal: `192`,publisher: `The MIT Press`,title: `Neuroplasticity`,year: `2016`,tags: `#merged,tesse`},

Most existing speech-transmission-index-based metrics make use of the temporal envelope information and discard the temporal fine structure (TFS) cue to predict speech intelligibility. Recent studies have shown that the TFS stimulus synthesized with multiband TFS waveforms contains rich intelligibility information, which is reflected as the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus. The present study first assessed the performance of using the recovered envelope from the synthesized TFS stimulus to predict the intelligibility of noise-distorted and noise-suppressed speech. The TFS stimulus was synthesized and fed as an input into the conventional normalized covariance measure (NCM) module. The results showed that the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus predicted the intelligibility as well as the original envelope extracted from the wideband speech signal did. In addition, an additive intelligibility model was designed to combine the envelope from wideband speech and the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus to predict speech intelligibility. The prediction power was significantly improved when these two envelope waveforms were integrated. The present study suggests that the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus may be alternative acoustic information for modeling speech intelligibility and improving the prediction power of the conventional NCM-based intelligibility index.`,doi: `10.1016/j.specom.2016.01.006`,issn: `01676393`,journal: `Speech Communication`,keywords: `Normalized covariance measure,Recovered envelope,Speech intelligibility,Temporal fine structure`,pages: `120--128`,publisher: `Elsevier B.V.`,title: `Modeling speech intelligibility with recovered envelope from temporal fine structure stimulus`,volume: `81`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/unused/5147-F.pdf`,tags: `speech,temporal envelope`},

  {key: `2016_bucur1`,type: `book`,author: `Voichita Bucur`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Introduction This book addresses core questions about the role of materials in general and of wood in particular in the construction of string instruments used in the modern symphony orchestra - violins, violas, cellos and basses. Further attention is given to materials for classical guitars, harps, harpsichords and pianos. While some of the approaches discussed are traditional, most of them depend upon new scientific approaches to the study of the structure of materials, such as for example wood cell structure, which is visible only using modern high resolution microscopic techniques. Many examples of modern and classical instruments are examined, together with the relevance of classical techniques for the treatment of wood. Composite materials, especially designed for soundboards could be a good substitute for some traditional wood species. The body and soundboard of the instrument are of major importance for their acoustical properties, but the study also examines traditional and new wood species used for items such as bows, the instrument neck, string pegs, etc. Wood species' properties for musical instruments and growth origins of woods used by great makers such as Antonio Stradivari are examined and compared with more recently grown woods available to current makers. The role of varnish in the appearance and acoustics of the final instrument is also discussed, since it has often been proposed as a ‘secret ingredient' used by great makers. Aspects related to strings are commented. As well as discussing these subjects, with many illustrations from classical and contemporary instruments, the book gives attention to conservation and restoration of old instruments and the physical results of these techniques. There is also discussion of the current value of old instruments both for modern performances and as works of art having great monetary value. The book will be of interest and value to researchers, advanced students, music historians, and contemporary string instrument makers. Musicians in general, particularly those playing string instruments, will also find its revelations fascinating. It will also attract the attention of those using wood for a variety of other purposes, for its use in musical instruments uncovers many of its fundamental features.`,doi: `10.1007/978-3-319-32080-9`,isbn: `9783319320809`,journal: `Handbook of Materials for String Musical Instruments`,keywords: `Acoustic properties of woods,Conservation and restoration of musical insrtument,Construction of string instruments,Historic musical instruments,Materials mechanics in musical instruments,The materials science of string instruments,Wood anysotropy in musical instruments`,pages: `1--975`,publisher: `Springer International Publishing`,title: `Handbook of materials for string musical instruments`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Materials/2016 Handbook of Materials for String Musical Instruments - Voichita Bucur.pdf`},

These new materials might increase product sustainability but they are currently confined to niche markets. While research has gained important insight into the technical challenges, few studies to date explore the behavioral aspects for product developers as they move to employ bioplastics in their development efforts. This manuscript reports the findings of a grounded inductive study based on interview data with 32 product developers in the consumer goods industry. The Theory of Planned Behavior is employed to guide the research and provide a theoretical background to derive implications. The study finds that behavioral challenges impede the increased use of bioplastics. Product developers experience a lack of perceived behavioral control and struggle with doubts about the environmental benefits and incurring trade-offs of bioplastics with respect to the Triple Bottom Line. While product developers are intrinsically motivated to make more use of bioplastics, they often refrain from bringing products to the mass market due to uncertainties of customer receptiveness and fears of greenwashing allegations. Implications for industry and research are detailed.`,doi: `10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.003`,issn: `0959-6526`,journal: `Journal of Cleaner Production`,langid: `english`,pages: `84--95`,shorttitle: `A crossroads for bioplastics`,title: `A crossroads for bioplastics: exploring product developers' challenges to move beyond petroleum-based plastics`,url: `https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652616302414`,urldate: `2019-04-07`,volume: `127`,year: `2016`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/Environment/2016 a crossroads for bioplastics - brockhaus et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Extensive psychological evidence shows that humans prefer to conduct evaluations qualitatively rather than numer-ically. The qualitative evaluations are then converted into the numerical scores to fairly benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. Recently, lots of learning-based IQA models are proposed by analyzing the mapping from the images to numerical ratings. However, the learnt mapping can hardly be accurate enough because some information has been lost in such an irreversible conversion from the linguistic descriptions to numerical scores. In this paper, we propose a blind IQA model, which learns qualitative evaluations directly and outputs numeri-cal scores for general utilization and fair comparison. Images are represented by natural scene statistics features. A discriminative deep model is trained to classify the features into five grades, corresponding to five explicit mental concepts, i.e., excellent, good, fair, poor, and bad. A newly designed quality pooling is then applied to convert the qualitative labels into scores. The classification framework is not only much more natural than the regression-based models, but also robust to the small sample size problem. Thorough experiments are conducted on popular databases to verify the model's effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.

We optimize the parameters of the full transformation (linear transform, exponents, weights, constant) over a database of natural images, directly minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The optimized transformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantly smaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative methods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is differentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a density model on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to samples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as a prior probability density that can be used to remove additive noise.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Much less attention has been paid to the construction of these networks. We point out that different approaches can be taken to construct a bibliometric network. Normally the full counting approach is used, but we propose an alternative fractional counting approach. The basic idea of the fractional counting approach is that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a publication, should have equal weight, regardless of for instance the number of authors, citations, or references of a publication. We present two empirical analyses in which the full and fractional counting approaches yield very different results. These analyses deal with co-authorship networks of universities and bibliographic coupling networks of journals. Based on theoretical considerations and on the empirical analyses, we conclude that for many purposes the fractional counting approach is preferable over the full counting one.

In quadrature demodulation, RF signal is multiplied with the sine and cosine wave reference signal and then low-pass filtered to produce the base-band complex signal, which has high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient quadrature demodulation method for B-mode and color flow imaging, in which the RF signal is demodulated by a pair of finite impulse response filters without mixing with the reference signal, to reduce the computational complexity. The proposed method was evaluated with simulation and in vivo experiments. From the simulation results, the proposed quadrature demodulation method produced similar normalized residual sum of squares (NRSS) and velocity profile compared with the conventional quadrature demodulation method. In the in vivo color flow imaging experiments, the time of the demodulation process was 5.66 ms and 3.36 ms, for the conventional method and the proposed method, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed method can maintain the performance of quadrature demodulation while reducing computational complexity.`,doi: `10.1631/FITEE.1400205`,issn: `20959230`,journal: `Frontiers of Information Technology and Electronic Engineering`,keywords: `B-mode ultrasound imaging,Color flow imaging,Finite impulse response filter,Quadrature demodulation`,number: `4`,pages: `301--310`,title: `Anefficient quadrature demodulator for medical ultrasound imaging`,volume: `16`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/envelope/2015 Anefficient quadrature demodulator for medical ultrasound imaging - Zhou.pdf`},

  {key: `2015_yee3`,type: `book`,translator: ` `,author: `Thomas W. Yee`,editor: ` `,abstract: `This book presents a greatly enlarged statistical framework compared to generalized linear models (GLMs) with which to approach regression modelling. Comprising of about half-a-dozen major classes of statistical models, and fortified with necessary infrastructure to make the models more fully operable, the framework allows analyses based on many semi-traditional applied statistics models to be performed as a coherent whole. Since their advent in 1972, GLMs have unified important distributions under a single umbrella with enormous implications. However, GLMs are not flexible enough to cope with the demands of practical data analysis. And data-driven GLMs, in the form of generalized additive models (GAMs), are also largely confined to the exponential family. The methodology here and accompanying software (the extensive VGAM R package) are directed at these limitations and are described comprehensively for the first time in one volume. This book treats distributions and classical models as generalized regression models, and the result is a much broader application base for GLMs and GAMs. The book can be used in senior undergraduate or first-year postgraduate courses on GLMs or categorical data analysis and as a methodology resource for VGAM users. In the second part of the book, the R package VGAM allows readers to grasp immediately applications of the methodology. R code is integrated in the text, and datasets are used throughout.

  {key: `2015_yee1`,type: `book`,author: `Thomas W Yee`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `This book presents a greatly enlarged statistical framework compared to generalized linear models (GLMs) with which to approach regression modelling. Comprising of about half-a-dozen major classes of statistical models, and fortified with necessary infrastructure to make the models more fully operable, the framework allows analyses based on many semi-traditional applied statistics models to be performed as a coherent whole. Since their advent in 1972, GLMs have unified important distributions under a single umbrella with enormous implications. However, GLMs are not flexible enough to cope with the demands of practical data analysis. And data-driven GLMs, in the form of generalized additive models (GAMs), are also largely confined to the exponential family. The methodology here and accompanying software (the extensive VGAM R package) are directed at these limitations and are described comprehensively for the first time in one volume. This book treats distributions and classical models as generalized regression models, and the result is a much broader application base for GLMs and GAMs. The book can be used in senior undergraduate or first-year postgraduate courses on GLMs or categorical data analysis and as a methodology resource for VGAM users. In the second part of the book, the R package VGAM allows readers to grasp immediately applications of the methodology. R code is integrated in the text, and datasets are used throughout. Potential applications include ecology, finance, biostatistics, and social sciences. The methodological contribution of this book stands alone and does not require use of the VGAM package.`,annote: `OCLC: ocn907271683`,doi: `10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7`,isbn: `9781493928187`,journal: `Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R`,keywords: `Datenverarbeitung,Hochleistungsrechnen,Linear models (Statistics),Lineares Modell,Regression analysis,Statistisches Modell,Vector spaces,Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie`,pages: `1--589`,publisher: `Springer`,series: `Springer series in statistics`,shorttitle: `Vector generalized linear and additive models`,title: `Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R`,year: `2015`},

These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d2) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields a speedup of D/4d, i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1412.7091`,eprint: `1412.7091`,issn: `10495258`,journal: `Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems`,pages: `1108--1116`,title: `Efficient exact gradient update for training deep networks with very large sparse targets`,volume: `2015-January`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2014 efficient exact gradient update for training deep networks with very large - vincent et al.pdf`,tags: `#corrupted author,#merged`},

The employed multivariate pattern recognition approach represents a modification of the CORA3 algorithm. The approach is found to be robust regardless of reasonable changes of its inputs.

  {key: `2015_tang_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Jiexiong Tang and  ChenweiDeng and Guang-Bin Huang`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `— Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parame-ters are randomly generated and the output weights are analyti-cally computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via 1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.

  {key: `2015_tambe`,type: `article`,author: `Arunesh Sinha Bo An，Milind Tambe`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Security is a critical concern around the world, whether it is the challenge of protecting ports, airports and other critical infrastructure, interdicting the illegal flow of drugs, weapons and money, protecting endangered species, forests and fisheries, suppressing urban crime or security in cyberspace. Unfortunately, limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times; instead, we must optimize the use of limited security resources. To that end, we founded the "security games" framework to build decision-aids for security agencies. Security games is a novel area of research that is based on computational and behavioral game theory, while also incorporating elements of AI planning under uncertainty and machine learning. We have deployed securitygames based decision aids for infrastructure security such as at the ports and ferry traffic with the US coast guard (in the ports of New York, Boston, Los Angeles/Long Beach, Houston and others), for security of airports and air traffic with the US Federal Air Marshals and the Los Angeles World Airport (LAX) police, and tested this framework for security of metro trains with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. Moreover, recent work on "green security games" has led to testing our decision aids for protection of fisheries with the US Coast Guard and protection of wildlife at sites in multiple countries, and opportunistic crime security games have focused on suppressing urban crime. This chapter will discuss applications of security games, and outline research challenges in security games including algorithms for scaling up security games as well as for handling significant adversarial uncertainty and learning models of human adversary behaviors. امنیت یک نگرانی مهم در سراسر جهان است، که آیا آن را به چالش حفاظت از بنادر، فرودگاه ها و دیگر زیرساخت های حیاتی، ممنوعیت جریان غیر قانونی مواد مخدر، سلاح و پول، حفاظت از گونه های در معرض خطر، جنگل و شیلات، سرکوب جرم یا امنیت شهری در فضای مجازی است . متاسفانه، منابع امنیتی محدود جلوگیری از پوشش امنیتی کامل در هر زمان. در عوض، ما باید با استفاده از منابع امنیتی محدود بهینه سازی. برای این منظور، ما "بازی های امنیتی" چارچوب برای ساخت تصمیم کمک برای سازمان های امنیتی تاسیس شد. بازی های امنیت یک منطقه جدیدی از تحقیقاتی است که در تئوری بازی ها محاسباتی و رفتاری بر اساس، در حالی که همچنین ترکیب عناصر برنامه ریزی AI تحت عدم قطعیت و یادگیری ماشین است. ما کمک تصمیم گیری بر اساس securitygames برای امنیت زیرساخت هایی مانند در بنادر و کشتی های ترافیک با گارد ساحلی ایالات متحده (در بنادر نیویورک، بوستون، لس آنجلس / لانگ بیچ، هوستون و دیگران) مستقر کرده اند، برای امنیت فرودگاه ها و هوا ترافیک با مارشال ایالات متحده فدرال هوایی و پلیس فرودگاه جهان لس آنجلس (LAX)، و این چارچوب برای امنیت قطارهای مترو با وزارت لس آنجلس کلانتر تست شده است. علاوه بر این، آثار اخیر در "بازی های امنیت سبز" است به آزمایش ایدز تصمیم ما برای حفاظت از ماهیگیری با گارد ساحلی ایالات متحده و حفاظت از حیات وحش در سایت ها در کشورهای متعدد، و بازی های امنیتی جرم و جنایت فرصت طلب به رهبری در سرکوب جرم و جنایت شهری متمرکز شده است. این فصل برنامه های کاربردی از بازی های امنیتی مورد بحث، و رئوس مطالب چالش های پژوهش در بازی های امنیتی از جمله الگوریتم برای پوسته پوسته شدن تا بازی امنیتی و همچنین برای دست زدن به عدم قطعیت خصمانه قابل توجه و مدل های رفتارهای دشمن انسان یادگیری`,pages: `1--23`,title: `Stackelberg Security Games (SSG) Basics Overview`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Game Theory/2017 Stackelberg Security Games (SSG) Basics and Application Overview  2017AnStackelberg.pdf`},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally ﬁnd the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of ﬁxed values achieves improved classiﬁcation accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate "reasonable bounds" – linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures.

Slama and Bertrand Delgutte`,abstract: `Speech reception depends critically on temporal modulations in the amplitude envelope of the speech signal. Reverberation encountered in everyday environments can substantially attenuate these modulations. To assess the effect of reverberation on the neural coding of amplitude envelope, we recorded from single units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbit using sinusoidally amplitude modulated (AM) broadband noise stimuli presented in simulated anechoic and reverberant environments. Although reverberation degraded both rate and temporal coding of AM in IC neurons, in most neurons, the degradation in temporal coding was smaller than the AM attenuation in the stimulus. This compensation could largely be accounted for by the compressive shape of the modulation input-output function (MIOF), which describes the nonlinear transformation of modulation depth from acoustic stimuli into neural responses. Additionally, in a subset of neurons, the temporal coding of AM was better for reverberant stimuli than for anechoic stimuli having the same modulation depth at the ear. Using hybrid anechoic stimuli that selectively possess certain properties of reverberant sounds, we show that this reverberant advantage is not caused by envelope distortion, static interaural decorrelation, or spectral coloration. Overall, our results suggest that the auditory system may possess dual mechanisms that make the coding of amplitude envelope relatively robust in reverberation: one general mechanism operating for all stimuli with small modulation depths, and another mechanism dependent on very specific properties of reverberant stimuli, possibly the periodic fluctuations in interaural correlation at the modulation frequency.`,doi: `10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3615-14.2015`,issn: `15292401`,journal: `Journal of Neuroscience`,keywords: `Amplitude modulation,Envelope,Inferior colliculus,Reverberation,Single-unit,Unanesthetized rabbit`,number: `10`,pages: `4452--4468`,pmid: `25762687`,title: `Neural coding of sound envelope in reverberant environments`,volume: `35`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/unused/4452.full.pdf`,tags: `envelope`},

We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs-directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions- and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function's gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm.

Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by CNNs as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the CNN framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 LVCSR tasks indicate that a CNN with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12%-14% relative improvement in WER over a strong DNN system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1309.1501`,doi: `10.1016/j.neunet.2014.08.005`,eprint: `1309.1501`,isbn: `08936080`,issn: `18792782`,journal: `Neural Networks`,keywords: `Deep learning,Neural networks,Speech recognition,speech recognition`,pages: `39--48`,pmid: `25439765`,publisher: `Elsevier Ltd`,title: `Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Large-scale Speech Tasks`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2014.08.005`,volume: `64`,year: `2015`,tags: `speech recognition`},

Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus. The objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some ﬁeld, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. To do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in WoS (13,605 journals) and Scopus (20,346 journals) with Ulrich's extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. These results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, WoS and Scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different ﬁelds, institutions, countries or languages. The bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientiﬁc output that are not covered in WoS or Scopus, such as ﬁeld-speciﬁc and national citation indexes.`,doi: `10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5`,issn: `0138-9130,1588-2861`,journal: `Scientometrics`,keywords: `bibliometry`,langid: `en`,number: `1`,pages: `213--228`,publisher: `Springer Science and Business Media LLC`,shorttitle: `The journal coverage of Web of Science and Scopus`,title: `The journal coverage of Web of Science and Scopus: a comparative analysis`,url: `http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5.pdf`,volume: `106`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Bibliometry/2016 The Journal Coverage of Web of Science and Scopus_a Comparative Analysis  2016Mongeonjournal.pdf`,tags: `#corrupted author,bibliometry,#merged,#retrieved`},

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.`,doi: `10.1038/nature14236`,issn: `14764687`,journal: `Nature`,number: `7540`,pages: `529--533`,pmid: `25719670`,title: `Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning`,url: `http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236`,volume: `518`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Reinforcement Learning/2015 Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning - Mnih et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

The book fills an important gap in the literature, providing readers with a practice-oriented reference guide to fuzzy logic that offers more complexity than popular books yet is more accessible than other mathematical treatises on the topic. As such, students in first-year university courses with a basic tertiary mathematical background and no previous experience with programming should be able to easily follow the content. The book is intended for students and professionals in the fields of computer science and engineering, as well as disciplines including astronomy, biology, medicine and earth sciences.

In effect, characterisation is the process of forming an impression of a character in your head as you read. This includes determining the personal qualities of the character in question as well as other aspects such as their social and physical characteristics. In this chapter I explain how stylistics has tackled the issue of characterisation. I begin by discussing four different views of the ontological status of characters. I argue in favour of the standpoint that sees characters as mental representations in readers' heads. Consequently, I outline a particularly influential cognitive stylistic model of characterisation proposed by Culpeper (2001). I show how this can be used to uncover aspects of characterisation by analysing a number of extracts from prose and dramatic texts, as well as a longer extract from Dennis Potter's 1978 TV drama Pennies from Heaven (D. Potter 1996). I focus particularly on the opening scene of the first episode. Finally, I demonstrate the practical value of understanding the characterisation process by analysing the hearing-impaired subtitles for the scene from the Pennies from Heaven DVD (Pennies from Heaven 1978). I show how the differences between these and the original dialogue are likely to impact on viewers' impressions of the two characters in the scene.`,doi: `10.1017/CBO9781139237031.013`,isbn: `9781139237031`,journal: `The Cambridge Handbook of Stylistics`,pages: `149--164`,title: `Characterisation`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Materials/2004 Principles of polymerization - Odian.pdf`},

This is a fundamental question for technology entrepreneurs, investors, lawyers and the innovation system as a whole. In this study, I shed light on this issue by conducting an empirical analysis of the patenting strategies of technology startups, examining the relationship between a company's patent applications and different events over the company's life: rounds of investment received, company acquisition and closure. I provide the first comprehensive cross-industry analysis of this question, by analyzing the patent portfolios of United States startups listed in CrunchBase, a crowd-sourced registry of tech companies used by the startup industry. By looking into these companies' public patent applications from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database between 2008 and 2012, I examine the patenting patterns of startups as they progress through funding rounds. Through a quantitative analysis, I find that companies based in California tend to patent more than in other states, and that companies that are venture-backed patent more than those who are not. I also unveil that most start-ups that patent file their first application before even receiving any reported funding. Moreover, I find that there is a significant positive relationship between patent protection, and receiving investment and being acquired. I further find that the number of patents (and not merely the fact that a company has patents or not) contributes to higher total funding. I finally observe that patenting early is also associated to higher funding, and that early may be more important for start-ups than what some views in venture capital may predict. I also conclude that while more patents are associated with higher funding, patents account for a relevant but small portion of a company's success. The study provides novel insights on startup patenting strategies. It lays empirical groundwork on key circumstances under which patents can contribute to a startup's growth, to provide important guidance to the legal and entrepreneurial communities.`,doi: `10.2139/ssrn.2610433`,issn: `1556-5068`,journal: `SSRN Electronic Journal`,shorttitle: `Patent Strategies of Technology Startups`,title: `Patent Strategies of Technology Startups: An Empirical Study`,url: `http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2610433`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2015 Patent Strategies of Technology Startups An Empirical Study - Lerman.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

We pursue a careful exploration of approaches to allow pooling to learn and to adapt to complex and variable patterns. The two primary directions lie in (1) learning a pooling function via (two strategies of) combining of max and average pooling, and (2) learning a pooling function in the form of a tree-structured fusion of pooling ﬁlters that are themselves learned. In our experiments every generalized pooling operation we explore improves performance when used in place of average or max pooling. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pooling operations provide a boost in invariance properties relative to conventional pooling and set the state of the art on several widely adopted benchmark datasets; they are also easy to implement, and can be applied within various deep neural network architectures.

This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of non-linearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit assignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for the imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation, is very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results comparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous units and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic networks.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1412.7525`,doi: `10.1007/978-3-319-23528-8_31`,eprint: `1412.7525`,isbn: `9783319235271`,issn: `16113349`,journal: `Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)`,pages: `498--515`,title: `Difference target propagation`,volume: `9284`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2015 Difference Target Propagation.pdf`},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript.

This introductory textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Technical and mathematical material is augmented with explanatory worked examples, and case studies illustrate the application of these models in the broader business context.After discussing the trajectory from data to insight to decision, the book describes four approaches to machine learning: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, and error-based learning. Each of these approaches is introduced by a nontechnical explanation of the underlying concept, followed by mathematical models and algorithms illustrated by detailed worked examples. Finally, the book considers techniques for evaluating prediction models and offers two case studies that describe specific data analytics projects through each phase of development, from formulating the business problem to implementation of the analytics solution. The book, informed by the authors' many years of teaching machine learning, and working on predictive data analytics projects, is suitable for use by undergraduates in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics; by graduate students in disciplines with applications for predictive data analytics; and as a reference for professionals.`,edition: `1`,pagetotal: `624`,publisher: `The MIT Press`,shorttitle: `Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics`,title: `Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies`,year: `2015`},

Functional aptness is taken for granted at the first commercial launch of a new material. Nevertheless, this alone may not be enough for its commercial success and widespread use.

This requires qualifying the material not only for what it is, but also for what it does, what it expresses to us, what it elicits from us, and what it makes us do. In search of a proper application through such an understanding, material scientists and industries have reached out to designers to guide the development of materials by experiential goals. However, how to design for experiences with and for a material at hand has been poorly addressed to date. In this article, we propose a method, Material Driven Design (MDD), to facilitate designing for material experiences.

Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classiﬁcation: reaching 4.9/////////% top-5 validation error (and 4.8/////////% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.`,arxivid: `1502.03167v3`,eprint: `1502.03167v3`,eprinttype: `arXiv`,journal: `arXiv:1502.03167 [cs]`,langid: `english`,shorttitle: `Batch Normalization`,title: `Batch Normalization : Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167`,urldate: `2019-03-26`,year: `2015`},

Extensive psychological evidence shows that humans prefer to conduct evaluations qualitatively rather than numerically. The qualitative evaluations are then converted into the numerical scores to fairly benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. Recently, lots of learning-based IQA models are proposed by analyzing the mapping from the images to numerical ratings. However, the learnt mapping can hardly be accurate enough because some information has been lost in such an irreversible conversion from the linguistic descriptions to numerical scores. In this paper, we propose a blind IQA model, which learns qualitative evaluations directly and outputs numerical scores for general utilization and fair comparison. Images are represented by natural scene statistics features. A discriminative deep model is trained to classify the features into ﬁve grades, corresponding to ﬁve explicit mental concepts, i.e., excellent, good, fair, poor, and bad. A newly designed quality pooling is then applied to convert the qualitative labels into scores. The classiﬁcation framework is not only much more natural than the regression-based models, but also robust to the small sample size problem. Thorough experiments are conducted on popular databases to verify the model’s effectiveness, efﬁciency, and robustness.`,doi: `10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2336852`,issn: `2162-237X, 2162-2388`,journal: `IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems`,keywords: `image classification,sentiment analysis`,langid: `english`,number: `6`,pages: `1275--1286`,publisher: `IEEE`,title: `Blind Image Quality Assessment via Deep Learning`,url: `http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6872541`,urldate: `2019-04-05`,volume: `26`,year: `2015`,tags: `sentiment analysis,#merged,image classification,tesse`},

  {key: `2015_highl_etal2`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: ` Highl and Tyler Er and Andres Rodriguez`,abstract: `Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently state-of-the-art for various classification tasks, but are computationally expensive. Propagating through the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer must sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward propagation which equates to \$/mathcalO(N^2n^2)\$ per kernel per layer where the inputs are \$N /times N\$ arrays and the kernels are \$n /times n\$ arrays. Convolution can be efficiently performed as a Hadamard product in the frequency domain. The bottleneck is the transformation which has a cost of \$/mathcalO(N^2/log_2 N)\$ using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, the increase in efficiency is less significant when \$N/gg n\$ as is the case in CNNs. We mitigate this by using the "overlap-and-add" technique reducing the computational complexity to \$/mathcalO(N^2/log_2 n)\$ per kernel. This method increases the algorithm's efficiency in both the forward and backward propagation, reducing the training and testing time for CNNs. Our empirical results show our method reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16.3 times the traditional convolution implementation for a 8 \$/times\$ 8 kernel and a 224 \$/times\$ 224 image.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1601.06815`,doi: `10.5244/c.29.160`,eprint: `1601.06815`,pages: `160.1----160.9`,title: `Very Efficient Training of Convolutional Neural Networks using Fast Fourier Transform and Overlap-and-Add`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06815`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2016 very efficient training of convolutional neural networks using fast fourier - highlander et al.pdf`},

Besides the baseline features, we extract from audio the functionals on low-level descriptors (LLDs) obtained via the YAAFE toolbox, and from video the Local Phase Quantization from Three Orthogonal Planes (LPQ-TOP) features. From the physiological signals, we extract 52 electro-cardiogram (ECG) features and 22 electro-dermal activity (EDA) features from various analysis domains. The extracted features along with the AV +EC 2015 baseline features of audio, ECG or EDA are concatenated for a further feature selection step, in which the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), instead of the usual Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), has been used as objective function. In addition, offsets between the features and the arousal/valence labels are considered in both feature selection and modeling of the affective dimensions. For the fusion of multimodal features, we propose a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM-RNN) based multimodal affect prediction framework, in which the initial predictions from the single modalities via the DBLSTM-RNNs are firstly smoothed with Gaussian smoothing, then input into a second layer of DBLSTMRNN for the final prediction of affective state. Experimental results show that our proposed features and the DBLSTMRNN based fusion framework obtain very promising results.

Dally`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems. Also, conventional networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9×, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the total number of parameters can be reduced by 13×, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1506.02626`,eprint: `1506.02626`,issn: `10495258`,journal: `Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems`,pages: `1135--1143`,title: `Learning both weights and connections for efficient neural networks`,volume: `2015-January`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/pruning ANNs/2015 Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks.pdf`},

Traditionally, the focus of time-series classification has been on short time-series data composed of a few patterns exhibiting variabilities, while recently there have been attempts to focus on longer series composed of multiple local patrepeating with an arbitrary irregularity. The primary contribution of this paper relies on presenting a method which can detect local patterns in repetitive time-series via fitting local polynomial functions of a specified degree. We capture the repetitiveness degrees of time-series datasets via a new measure. Furthermore, our method approximates local polynomials in linear time and ensures an overall linear running time complexity. The coefficients of the polynomial functions are converted to symbolic words via equi-area discretizations of the coefficients' distributions. The symbolic polynomial words enable the detection of similar local patterns by assigning the same word to similar polynomials. Moreover, a histogram of the frequencies of the words is constructed from each time-series' bag of words. Each row of the histogram enables a new representation for the series and symbolizes the occurrence of local patterns and their frequencies. In an experimental comparison against state-of-the-art baselines on repetitive datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvements in terms of prediction accuracy.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1307.6365v4`,doi: `10.1109/TKDE.2014.2377746`,eprint: `1307.6365v4`,issn: `10414347`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering`,keywords: `Time-series classification,bag-of-words,symbolic polynomials`,number: `6`,pages: `1683--1695`,title: `Scalable classification of repetitive time series through frequencies of local polynomials`,volume: `27`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2015 Scalable Classification of Repetitive Time Series Through Frequencies of Local Polynomials - Grabocka et al.pdf`},

With embedded hardware growing more powerful, much of its software is moving to C++, too. Mastering C++ gives you strong skills for programming at nearly every level, from "close to the hardware" to the highest-level abstractions. In short, C++ is a language that scientific and technical practitioners need to know. Peter Gottschling’s Discovering Modern C++ is an intensive introduction that guides you smoothly to sophisticated approaches based on advanced features. Gottschling introduces key concepts using examples from many technical problem domains, drawing on his extensive experience training professionals and teaching C++ to students of physics, math, and engineering. This book is designed to help you get started rapidly and then master increasingly robust features, from lambdas to expression templates. You’ll also learn how to take advantage of the powerful libraries available to C++ programmers: both the Standard Template Library (STL) and scientific libraries for arithmetic, linear algebra, differential equations, and graphs. Throughout, Gottschling demonstrates how to write clear and expressive software using object orientation, generics, metaprogramming, and procedural techniques. By the time you’re finished, you’ll have mastered all the abstractions you need to write C++ programs with exceptional quality and performance.`,edition: `1`,isbn: `9780134383583`,location: `Boston`,pagetotal: `480`,publisher: `Addison-Wesley Professional`,shorttitle: `Discovering Modern C++`,title: `Discovering Modern C++: An Intensive Course for Scientists, Engineers, and Programmers`,year: `2015`},

These two problems are closely re-lated to synthesis and analysis of functions. The Fourier transform is the classical tool used to solve them. More recently, wavelets have entered the arena providing more robust and flexible solutions to discretize and reconstruct functions. Starting from Fourier analysis, the course guides the audience to ac-quire an understanding of the basic ideas and techniques behind the wavelets. We start by introducing the basic concepts of function spaces and operators, both from the continuous and discrete viewpoints. We introduce the Fourier and Window Fourier Transform, the classical tools for function analysis in the frequency domain, and we use them as a guide to arrive at the Wavelet transform. The fundamental aspects multires-olution representation and its importance to function discretization and to the construction of wavelets is also discussed. Emphasis will be given on ideas and intuition, avoiding the heavy computations which are usually involved in the study of wavelets. The attendees should have a basic knowledge of Linear Algebra, Calculus, and some familiarity with Complex Analysis.

The first articles addressing the pre-salt fields had a focus on the technical challenges faced on first years: the heterogeneous nature of the microbial carbonate reservoir, the 2,000 m salt layer and drilling concerns associated, the variable CO2 content and compositional grading in the reservoir fluids, flow assurance issues and special demands concerning subsea engineering, well construction and processing plant. The main drivers and development strategies were also established: staged development, based on extended well tests (EWTs), multi well production pilots and definitive systems prioritizing the standardization of well projects and production systems. Now, challenges and plans are rewarding the efforts, as depicted by the concrete production numbers achieved to date. In this text, a historical perspective of the pre-salt exploration and development is presented, emphasizing the previous unknowns and uncertainties and how they were treated in order to attain the results.

By the time Umberto Eco published his best-selling novel The Name of the Rose, he was one of Italy's most celebrated intellectuals, a distinguished academic and the author of influential works on semiotics. Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, How to Write a Thesis, in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis―from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, How to Write a Thesis has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English. Eco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. How to Write a Thesis is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid "thesis neurosis" and he answers the important question "Must You Read Books?" He reminds students "You are not Proust" and "Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft." Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data.How to Write a Thesis belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere.

  {key: `2015_dehe_etal1`,type: `article`,author: `Benjamin Dehe and David Bamford`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `When planning a new development, location decisions have always been a major issue. This paper examines and compares two modelling methods used to inform a healthcare infrastructure location decision. Two Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) models were developed to support the optimisation of this decision-making process, within a National Health Service (NHS) organisation, in the UK. The proposed model structure is based on seven criteria (environment and safety, size, total cost, accessibility, design, risks and population profile) and 28 sub-criteria. First, Evidential Reasoning (ER) was used to solve the model, then, the processes and results were compared with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It was established that using ER or AHP led to the same solutions. However, the scores between the alternatives were significantly different; which impacted the stakeholders' decision-making. As the processes differ according to the model selected, ER or AHP, it is relevant to establish the practical and managerial implications for selecting one model or the other and providing evidence of which models best fit this specific environment. To achieve an optimum operational decision it is argued, in this study, that the most transparent and robust framework is achieved by merging ER process with the pair-wise comparison, an element of AHP. This paper makes a defined contribution by developing and examining the use of MCDA models, to rationalise new healthcare infrastructure location, with the proposed model to be used for future decision. Moreover, very few studies comparing different MCDA techniques were found, this study results enable practitioners to consider even further the modelling characteristics to ensure the development of a reliable framework, even if this means applying a hybrid approach.`,doi: `10.1016/j.eswa.2015.04.059`,issn: `09574174`,journal: `Expert Systems with Applications`,keywords: `Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP),Evidential Reasoning (ER),Location decision,Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)`,number: `19`,pages: `6717--6727`,publisher: `Elsevier Ltd`,title: `Development, test and comparison of two Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) models: A case of healthcare infrastructure location`,volume: `42`,year: `2015`,tags: `#merged`},

There is a finite set of users with demand of service and a finite set of potential locations for the facilities that will offer service to users. Two types of decisions must be made: Location decisions determine where to establish the facilities whereas allocation decisions dictate how to satisfy the users demand from the established facilities. Potential applications of various types arise in many different contexts.

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1409.1259`,doi: `10.3115/v1/w14-4012`,eprint: `1409.1259`,pages: `103--111`,title: `On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder–Decoder Approaches`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2014 On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation Encoder–Decoder Approaches - Cho et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Starting from the fundamental theory of black-box optimization, the material progresses towards recent advances in structural optimization and stochastic optimization. Our presentation of black-box optimization, strongly influenced by Nesterov's seminal book and Nemirovski's lecture notes, includes the analysis of cutting plane methods, as well as (accelerated) gradient descent schemes. We also pay special attention to non- Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, minibatches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1405.4980`,doi: `10.1561/2200000050`,eprint: `1405.4980`,issn: `19358245`,journal: `Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning`,number: `3-4`,pages: `231--357`,title: `Convex optimization: Algorithms and complexity`,volume: `8`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/ANNs&Sustainability/2015 Convex Optimization Algorithms and Complexity.pdf`},

As a consequence, clustering can suffer from the presence of noisy data points and outliers,which can obscure the structure of the clusters in the data and thus may drive clustering algorithms to yield suboptimal or even misleading results. Fuzzy clustering is no exception in this respect, although it features an aspect of robustness, due to which outliers and generally data points that are atypical for the clusters in the data have a lesser influence on the cluster parameters. Starting from this aspect, we provide in this paper an overview of different approaches with which fuzzy clustering can be made less sensitive to noise and outliers and categorize them according to the component of standard fuzzy clustering they modify.`,annote: `OCLC: 908374518`,isbn: `9783319196824`,issn: `14349922`,journal: `Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing`,keywords: `fuzzy set theory`,number: `326`,pages: `315--335`,publisher: `Springer`,series: `Studies in fuzziness and soft computing`,title: `Fifty Years of Fuzzy Logic and its Applications`,url: `http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84930225797&partnerID=tZOtx3y1`,volume: `326`,year: `2015`},

That book devoted only about 90 pages to matrix computations compared to the more than 700 pages of the present book. This difference reflects not only a change in ambition, but also an increase in size and importance of the subject. A stunning growth in hardware performance has allowed more sophisticated mathematical models to be employed in sciences and engineering. In most of these applications, solution of systems of linear equations and/or eigenvalue problems lies at the core. Increased problem sizes and changes in computer architecture have also made the development of new methods and new implementations of old ones necessary. Although there is a link between matrix computations and linear algebra as taught in departments of mathematics, there are also several important differences. Matrices are used to represent many different objects such as networks and images, besides linear transformations. Concepts such as ill-conditioning, norms, and orthogonality, which do not extend to arbitrary fields, are central to matrix com- putations. This is the reason for not using ‘‘linear algebra'' in the title of the book.`,doi: `10.1007/978-3-319-05089-8`,isbn: `9783319050881`,pages: `800`,publisher: `Springer International Publishing`,series: `Texts in Applied Mathematics`,title: `Numerical Methods in Matrix Computations`,url: `http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-05089-8`,volume: `59`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Mathematics/2014 Numerical methods in matrix computations -.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and percussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others include reed-beating efects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction in fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the wire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective, whether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or sound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various dificulties, not the least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a novel finite diference time domain simulation framework for such collision problems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical energy conservation or dissipation, and where a power law formulation for collisions is employed, as a potential function within a passive formulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and as a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of such methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are presented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation, bounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as various aspects of musical instrument physics.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1405.2589`,doi: `10.3813/AAA.918813`,eprint: `1405.2589`,issn: `16101928`,journal: `Acta Acustica united with Acustica`,number: `1`,pages: `155--173`,title: `Numerical modeling of collisions in musical instruments`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2589`,volume: `101`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Musical/2014 Numerical Modeling of Collisions in Musical Instruments - Bilbao et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

However, rigorous evaluation of these kind of functions often implies a very high computational cost, unacceptable in real-time applications. To alleviate this problem, functions are commonly approximated by simpler piecewise-polynomial representations. Following this idea, we propose a novel, efficient, and practical technique to evaluate complex and continuous functions using a nearly optimal design of two types of piecewise linear approximations in the case of a large budget of evaluation subintervals. To this end, we develop a thorough error analysis that yields asymptotically tight bounds to accurately quantify the approximation performance of both representations. It provides an improvement upon previous error estimates and allows the user to control the tradeoff between the approximation error and the number of evaluation subintervals. To guarantee real-time operation, the method is suitable for, but not limited to, an efficient implementation in modern graphics processing units, where it outperforms previous alternative approaches by exploiting the fixed-function interpolation routines present in their texture units. The proposed technique is a perfect match for any application requiring the evaluation of continuous functions; we have measured in detail its quality and efficiency on several functions, and, in particular, the Gaussian function because it is extensively used in many areas of computer vision and cybernetics, and it is expensive to evaluate.`,doi: `10.1109/TCYB.2015.2482365`,issn: `21682275`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics`,keywords: `Bessel,Computer vision,Gaussian,Image processing,Lorentzian,Numerical approximation and analysis,Parallel processing,Piecewise linearization`,number: `10`,pages: `2584--2595`,title: `Optimal piecewise linear function approximation for gpu-based applications`,volume: `46`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/approx k segments/2016 Optimal Piecewise Linear Function Approximation for GPU-Based Applications - Berjon et al..pdf`},

Feature selection based on information theory is a popular approach due its computational efficiency, scalability in terms of the dataset dimensionality, and independence from the classifier. Common drawbacks of this approach are the lack of information about the interaction between the features and the classifier, and the selection of redundant and irrelevant features. The latter is due to the limitations of the employed goal functions leading to overestimation of the feature significance. To address this problem, this article introduces two new nonlinear feature selection methods, namely Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) and Normalised Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (NJMIM); both these methods use mutual information and the 'maximum of the minimum' criterion, which alleviates the problem of overestimation of the feature significance as demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The proposed methods are compared using eleven publically available datasets with five competing methods. The results demonstrate that the JMIM method outperforms the other methods on most tested public datasets, reducing the relative average classification error by almost 6% in comparison to the next best performing method. The statistical significance of the results is confirmed by the ANOVA test. Moreover, this method produces the best trade-off between accuracy and stability.`,doi: `10.1016/j.eswa.2015.07.007`,isbn: `09574174`,issn: `09574174`,journal: `Expert Systems with Applications`,keywords: `Classification,Conditional mutual information,Dimensionality reduction,Feature selection,Feature selection stability,Joint mutual information,Mutual information,Subset feature selection,other`,number: `22`,pages: `8520--8532`,publisher: `Elsevier Ltd.`,title: `Feature selection using Joint Mutual Information Maximisation`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2015.07.007`,volume: `42`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2015 Feature selection using Joint Mutual Information Maximisation - Bennasar et al.pdf`,tags: `other`},

We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1502.04156`,eprint: `1502.04156`,title: `Towards Biologically Plausible Deep Learning`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04156`,year: `2015`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2016 Towards Biologically Plausible Deep Learning.pdf`},

Sure, I could follow mechanical steps, but I had no lasting intuition.The classes I've seen are too long, taught in the wrong order, and without solid visualizations. Here's how this course is different:1) It gets to the point. A typical class plods along, saving concepts like Integrals until Week 8. I want to see what calculus can offer by Minute 8. Each compact, tightly-written lesson can be read in 15 minutes.2) Concepts are taught in their natural order. Most classes begin with the theory of limits, a technical concept discovered 150 years after calculus was invented. That's like putting a new driver into a Formula-1 racecar on day 1. We can begin with the easy-to-grasp concepts discovered 2000 years ago.3) It has vivid analogies and visualizations. Calculus is usually defined as the "study of change"... which sounds like history or geology. Instead of an abstract definition, we'll see calculus a step-by-step viewpoint to explore patterns.4) It's written by a human, for humans. I'm not a haughty professor or strict schoolmarm.

Large scale neural networks are one of the mainstream tools of big data analytics. Processing big data with large scale neural networks includes two phases: the training phase and the operation phase. Huge computing power is required to support the training phase. And the energy efficiency (power efficiency) is one of the major considerations of the operation phase. We first explore the computing power of GPUs for big data analytics and demonstrate an efficient GPU implementation of the training phase of large scale recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We then introduce a promising ultrahigh energy efficient implementation of neural networks' operation phase by taking advantage of the emerging memristor technique. Experiment results show that the proposed GPU implementation of RNNs is able to achieve 2 ∼ 11× speed-up compared with the basic CPU implementation. And the scaled-up recurrent neural network trained with GPUs realizes an accuracy of 47% on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge, the best result achieved by a single RNN on the same dataset. In addition, the proposed memristor-based implementation of neural networks demonstrates power efficiency of > 400 GFLOPS/W and achieves energy savings of 22× on the HMAX model compared with its pure digital implementation counterpart. /textcopyright 2014 EDAA.`,doi: `10.7873/DATE2014.358`,isbn: `9783981537024`,issn: `15301591`,journal: `Proceedings - Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE`,number: `61373026`,pages: `1--2`,title: `Energy efficient neural networks for big data analytics`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2014WangEnergy Energy Efficient Neural Networks for Big Data Analytics.pdf`},

These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efﬁcient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d2) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output.

Existing sentiment clas- sification algorithms typically split a sen- tence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent senti- ment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as "not bad" and "a great deal of ". We address this issue by developing a joint segmentation and classification framework (JSC), which si- multaneously conducts sentence segmen- tation and sentence-level sentiment classi- fication. Specifically, we use a log-linear model to score each segmentation candi- date, and exploit the phrasal information of top-ranked segmentations as features to build the sentiment classifier. A marginal log-likelihood objective function is de- vised for the segmentation model, which is optimized for enhancing the sentiment classification performance. The joint mod- el is trained only based on the annotat- ed sentiment polarity of sentences, with- out any segmentation annotations.

Articles from Game Theory Tuesdays have been referenced in The Freakonomics Blog, Yahoo Finance, and CNN.com. Game theory is the study of interactive decision making--that is, in situations where each person's action affects the outcome for the whole group. Game theory is a beautiful subject and this book will teach you how to understand the theory and practically implement solutions through a series of stories and the aid of over 30 illustrations. This book has two primary objectives. (1) To help you recognize strategic games, like the Prisoner's Dilemma, Bertrand Duopoly, Hotelling's Game, the Game of Chicken, and Mutually Assured Destruction. (2) To show you how to make better decisions and change the game, a powerful concept that can transform no-win situations into mutually beneficial outcomes. You'll learn how to negotiate better by making your threats credible, sometimes limiting options or burning bridges, and thinking about new ways to create better outcomes. As these goals indicate, game theory is about more than board games and gambling. It all seems so simple, and yet that definition belies the complexity of game theory. While it may only take seconds to get a sense of game theory, it takes a lifetime to appreciate and master it.

But, the extensive use of fossil fuels is causing the gradual decrease of fossil fuels. Therefore, a way to get rid of widespread of using fossil fuels is by developing a new renewable source that can benefit our environment. Resin is one of the important polymeric in the chemical industry. Resins such as alkyd resins are widely used in coatings and paint industry. There are many researches about producing a resin from renewable sources such as vegetable oils. The naturally used vegetable oils in producing resin are soyabean, rapeseed, coconut, castor or linseed oils. Other than that, there are many potential vegetable oils such as karawila, nahar, rubber or safflower oil. Scientist and engineers are dedicated to find another alternative to replace using fossil fuels as the main components in resin making. This study was inspired to do a research by using palm oil as the main components in making renewable resin or bio resin. In this study, waste cooking oil was used as the main component in making bio resin. The synthesis of resin begins with alcoholysis of waste cooking oil with glycerol followed by esterification process. Then, the monoglyceride was reacted with anhydride to obtain bio resin. The resulting product which is bio resin was characterized for physiochemical properties, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the infrared spectrum using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), melting point using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The result was compared with previous literature about producing resin from renewable material such as karawila seed oil. The expected resin is feasible in replacing synthetic resin. Thus, improvements and more research need to be made as to market the resin.`,institution: `UNIVERSITI MALAYSIA PAHANG`,number: `Bio-resin`,pages: `1--24`,title: `Production of Bio Resin From Palm Oil`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/PRODUCTION OF BIO RESIN FROM PALM OIL - Nazri.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.`,arxivid: `1102.4807`,doi: `10.1214/12-AOS1000`,eprint: `1102.4807`,eprinttype: `arXiv`,isbn: `15324435`,issn: `1533-7928`,journal: `Journal of Machine Learning Research`,keywords: `deep learning,model combination,neural networks,regularization,seminal`,langid: `english`,pages: `1929--1958`,title: `Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting`,volume: `15`,year: `2014`,tags: `seminal,#merged`},

Next, the salient word n-gram features in the word sequence are discovered by the model and are then aggregated to form a sentence-level feature vector. Finally, a non-linear transformation is applied to extract high-level semantic information to generate a continuous vector representation for the full text string.

Such artificial neural networks are commonly used in classification and regression settings to perform arbitrary tasks. In this work we suggest repurposing autoencoding neural networks as musical audio synthesizers. We offer an interactive musical audio synthesis system that uses feedforward artificial neural networks for musical audio synthesis, rather than discriminative or regression tasks. In our system an ANN is trained on frames of low-level features. A high level representation of the musical audio is learned though an autoencoding neural net. Our real-time synthesis system allows one to interact directly with the parameters of the model and generate musical audio in real time. This work therefore proposes the exploitation of neural networks for creative musical applications.

The collection surveys the core commitments of the PDP framework, the key issues the framework has addressed, and the debates the framework has spawned, and presents viewpoints on the current status of these issues. The articles focus on both historical roots and contemporary developments in learning, optimality theory, perception, memory, language, conceptual knowledge, cognitive control, and consciousness. Here we consider the approach more generally, reviewing the original motivations, the resulting framework, and the central tenets of the underlying theory. We then evaluate the impact of PDP both on the field at large and within specific subdomains of cognitive science and consider the current role of PDP models within the broader landscape of contemporary theoretical frameworks in cognitive science. Looking to the future, we consider the implications for cognitive science of the recent success of machine learning systems called "deep networks"-systems that build on key ideas presented in the PDP volumes. /textcopyright2014 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.`,doi: `10.1111/cogs.12148`,isbn: `97802621812049780262132183`,issn: `03640213`,journal: `Cognitive Science`,keywords: `Cognition,Cognitive control,Connectionist models,Language,Learning,Memory,Neural networks,Perception`,number: `6`,pages: `1024--1077`,pmid: `25087578`,publisher: `MIT Press`,series: `Computational models of cognition and perception`,shorttitle: `Parallel distributed processing`,title: `Parallel distributed processing at 25: Further explorations in the microstructure of cognition`,volume: `38`,year: `2014`,tags: `#merged`},

You will learn synthesizer operation, starting with the underlying theory of each synthesizer component, and moving on to the theory of how these components combine to form fully working musical instruments that function on a variety of target digital audio workstations (DAWs). Containing some of the latest advances in theory and algorithm development, this book contains information that has never been published in textbook form, including several unique algorithms of the author’s own design. The book is broken into three parts: plug-in programming, theory and design of the central synthesizer components of oscillators, envelope generators, and filters, and the design and implementation of six complete polyphonic software synthesizer musical instruments, which can be played in real time. The instruments implement advanced concepts including a user-programmable modulation matrix. The final chapter shows you the theory and code for a suite of delay effects to augment your synthesizers, introducing you to audio effect processing. The companion website, www.focalpress.com/cw/pirkle, gives you access to free software to guide you through the application of concepts discussed in the book, and code for both Windows and Mac platforms.

Basically, the instrument diversity comes from different geometries of resonance box, shapes of sound hole, types of wood, different tunings, and number and arrangement of strings. This paper intends to present the numerical and experimental modal analysis of a Brazilian guitar, without strings, in a free boundary condition. The modal analysis technique is applied in the determination of the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes. The main dimensions of an actual Brazilian guitar body are used to build the computational model geometry. The numerical modal analysis uses finite element method (FEM) to determine the dynamic behavior of the vibroacoustic system, which is composed by the structural and acoustic systems coupled. The experimental modal analysis is carried out in an actual Brazilian guitar body, where the structural modal parameters (frequency and mode shape) are extracted and used to update the numerical model. Finally, numerical and experimental results are compared and discussed.`,journal: `ISMA International Symposium on Music Acoustics, Le Mans, France`,number: `October 2015`,pages: `233--239`,title: `Modal analysis of a Brazilian guitar body`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Guitar/2014 Modal Analysis of a Brazilian Guitar Body - Paiva.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Temporal information at the output of each band can be separated into temporal fine structure (TFS), the rapid oscillations close to the center frequency and temporal envelope (ENV), slower amplitude modulations superimposed on the TFS. TFS information can be carried in the pattern of phase locking to the stimulus waveform, while ENV by the changes in firing rate over time. The relative importance of temporal ENV and TFS information in understanding speech has been studied using various sound-processing techniques. A number of studies demonstrated that ENV cues are associated with speech recognition in quiet, while TFS cues are possibly linked to melody/pitch perception and listening to speech in a competing background. However, there are evidences that recovered ENV from TFS as well as TFS itself may be partially responsible for speech recognition. Current technologies used in cochlear implants (CI) are not efficient in delivering the TFS cues, and new attempts have been made to deliver TFS information into sound-processing strategy in CI. We herein discuss the current updated findings of TFS with a literature review. /textcopyright2014 The Korean Audiological Society.`,doi: `10.7874/kja.2014.18.1.1`,issn: `20933797`,journal: `Korean Journal of Audiology`,keywords: `Hearing loss,Speech perception,Temporal envelope,Temporal fine structure`,number: `1`,pages: `1--7`,title: `What is temporal fine structure and why is it important?`,volume: `18`,year: `2014`,tags: `#merged`},

In this paper, we discuss some NIME design challenges, highlighting particularities related to the digital and musical nature of these artifacts, such as virtuosity, cultural elements, context of use, creation catalysis, success criteria, adoption strategy, etc. With these challenges, we aim to call attention for the intersection of music, computing and design, which can be an interesting area for people working on product design and interaction design.`,journal: `International Conference of Design, User Experience, and Usability`,keywords: `design challenges,digital musical instrument,interaction design,musical expression,new interfaces for,user experience`,pages: `643--652`,title: `Challenges in Designing New Interfaces`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/DMI/2014 Challenges in Designing New Interfaces for Musical Expression - Medeiros et al..pdf`},

Here we show that under common conditions the eigenvector centrality displays a localization transition that causes most of the weight of the centrality to concentrate on a small number of nodes in the network. In this regime the measure is no longer useful for distinguishing among the remaining nodes and its efficacy as a network metric is impaired. As a remedy, we propose an alternative centrality measure based on the nonbacktracking matrix, which gives results closely similar to the standard eigenvector centrality in dense networks where the latter is well behaved but avoids localization and gives useful results in regimes where the standard centrality fails.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1401.5093`,doi: `10.1103/PhysRevE.90.052808`,eprint: `1401.5093`,issn: `15502376`,journal: `Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics`,number: `5`,pages: `1--8`,title: `Localization and centrality in networks`,volume: `90`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Graph Theory/2015 Localization and centrality in networks.pdf`},

Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efﬁcient inference and learning. We deﬁne and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classiﬁcation networks (AlexNet [19], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by ﬁne-tuning [4] to the segmentation task. We then deﬁne a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, ﬁne layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20 ///% relative improvement to 62.2 ///% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one ﬁfth of a second for a typical image.`,eprint: `1411.4038`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1411.4038 [cs]`,langid: `english`,title: `Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038`,urldate: `2019-04-05`,year: `2014`,tags: `tesse`},

The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers.

In terms of generating intelligence, however, this pursuit has yielded only limited success. This book explores the hypothesis that adaptive growth is a means of moving forward. By emulating the biological process of development, we can incorporate desirable characteristics of natural neural systems into engineered designs and thus move closer towards the creation of brain-like systems. The particular focus is on how to design artificial neural networks for engineering tasks. The book consists of contributions from 18 researchers, ranging from detailed reviews of recent domains by senior scientists, to exciting new contributions representing the state of the art in machine learning research. The book begins with broad overviews of artificial neurogenesis and bio-inspired machine learning, suitable both as an introduction to the domains and as a reference for experts. Several contributions provide perspectives and future hypotheses on recent highly successful trains of research, including deep learning, the Hyper NEAT model of developmental neural network design, and a simulation of the visual cortex. Other contributions cover recent advances in the design of bio-inspired artificial neural networks, including the creation of machines for classification, the behavioural control of virtual agents, the design of virtual multi-component robots and morphologies and the creation of flexible intelligence. Throughout, the contributors share their vast expertise on the means and benefits of creating brain-like machines.

Operations researchers have made significant developments in the algorithms for their solution, and Vehicle Routing: Problems, Methods, and Applications, Second Edition reflects these advances. The text of the new edition is either completely new or significantly revised and provides extensive and complete state-of-the-art coverage of vehicle routing by those who have done most of the innovative research in the area; it emphasizes methodology related to specific classes of vehicle routing problems and, since vehicle routing is used as a benchmark for all new solution techniques, contains a complete overview of current solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. It also includes several chapters on important and emerging applications, such as disaster relief and green vehicle routing. Audience: This book is intended for both researchers and graduate level students in operations research and applied mathematics. Practitioners will find this book particularly useful.

These include problems ranging from pricing goods and resources, to improving search, to routing, and more generally to understanding how incentives of participants can be harnessed to improve the behavior of the overall system. As a result, Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Game Theory, which can be viewed as "incentive-aware algorithm design," have become an increasingly important part of algorithmic research in recent years. Along different lines, the area of Machine Learning has made continued progress in developing methods that can generalize from data, adapt to changing environments, and improve performance with experience, as well as progress in understanding fundamental underlying issues. It is clear these capabilities will be critical as well in the context of such large decentralized systems. While these areas seem quite distinct, recent results of the PIs have developed a number of important connections between them: fundamental questions in Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Game Theory turn out to have a strong relation to issues in Machine Learning and vice versa, and techniques from each seem well-poised to help with key problems of the other. The aim of this proposal is to further develop these connections in order to produce powerful mechanisms for adaptive and networked environments, and improve the experience of users of the Web and internet`,journal: `Cs.Cmu.Edu`,keywords: `NoKeywords,game theory`,pages: `1--18`,title: `Machine Learning, Game Theory, and Mechanism Design for a Networked World`,url: `https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\$/sim\$mblum/search/AGTML35.pdf%0Ahttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/mblum/search/AGTML35.pdf`,year: `2014`,tags: `game theory`},

This book serves as an introduction to both the theory and practice of scientific computing, with each chapter presenting the basic algorithms that serve as the workhorses of many scientific codes; we explain both the theory behind these algorithms and how they must be implemented in order to work reliably in finite-precision arithmetic.

  {key: `2014_fang`,type: `article`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,author: `Xing Fang`,abstract: `Observation systems known as errors-in-variables (EIV) models with model parameters estimated by total least squares (TLS) have been discussed for more than a century, though the terms EIV and TLS were coined much more recently. So far, it has only been shown that the inequality-constrained TLS (ICTLS) solution can be obtained by the combinatorial methods, assuming that the weight matrices of observations involved in the data vector and the data matrix are identity matrices. Although the previous works test all combinations of active sets or solution schemes in a clear way, some aspects have received little or no attention such as admissible weights, solution characteristics and numerical efficiency. Therefore, the aim of this study was to adjust the EIV model, subject to linear inequality constraints. In particular, (1) This work deals with a symmetrical positive-definite cofactor matrix that could otherwise be quite arbitrary. It also considers cross-correlations between cofactor matrices for the random coefficient matrix and the random observation vector. (2) From a theoretical perspective, we present first-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions and the second-order sufficient conditions of the inequality-constrained weighted TLS (ICWTLS) solution by analytical formulation. (3) From a numerical perspective, an active set method without combinatorial tests as well as a method based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is established. By way of applications, computational costs of the proposed algorithms are shown to be significantly lower than the currently existing ICTLS methods. It is also shown that the proposed methods can treat the ICWTLS problem in the case of more general weight matrices. Finally, we study the ICWTLS solution in terms of non-convex weighted TLS contours from a geometrical perspective. /textcopyright 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.`,doi: `10.1007/s00190-014-0723-y`,issn: `14321394`,journal: `Journal of Geodesy`,keywords: `Active set method,Errors-in-variables (EIV) model,Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions,Linear inequality constraints,Non-convex optimization,Second-order sufficient conditions,Sequential quadratic programming (SQP),WTLS contours,Weighted total least squares (WTLS)`,number: `8`,pages: `805--816`,title: `On non-combinatorial weighted total least squares with inequality constraints`,volume: `88`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Least mean squares/Fang2014_Article_OnNon-combinatorialWeightedTot.pdf`},

Our system is entitled Audio Compression Exploiting Repetition (ACER). ACER is a perceptual technique, but one that does not consider exploiting masking, but rather attempts to apply the principles of Lempel-Ziv and run-length encoding, by substituting audio sequences for numeric or character strings. The ACER procedure applies a pseudo exhaustive search process and spectral difference grading. Since ACER exploits musical structure, the amount of data reduction achieved varies from piece-to-piece. The system is described before results on a corpus of material are presented. The analysis shows moderate amounts of data reduction take place whilst the system is operating within parameters designed to maintain high-levels of perceptual audio quality, whilst lower rates of perceptual quality yield greater data reduction. Objective quality evaluations are conducted that reveal degradation in fidelity that is relative to the compression parameters. /textcopyright 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.`,doi: `10.1007/s11042-013-1504-y`,issn: `15737721`,journal: `Multimedia Tools and Applications`,keywords: `Audio,Compression,Music,Perceptual coding,Repetition`,number: `3`,pages: `2299--2320`,title: `Data reduction of audio by exploiting musical repetition`,volume: `72`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/2014 Data reduction of audio by exploiting musical repetition - Cunningham and Grout.pdf`},

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a ﬁxed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder–Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.`,eprint: `1409.1259`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1409.1259 [cs, stat]`,langid: `english`,shorttitle: `On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation`,title: `On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder Approaches`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1259`,urldate: `2019-03-26`,year: `2014`,tags: `tesse`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,doi: `10.1007/978-1-4842-0076-6`,edition: `2`,isbn: `9781484200773`,journal: `Pro Git`,publisher: `Apress`,title: `Pro Git`,year: `2014`,tags: `#merged`},

While peer review and bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics. Furthermore, their benefits and disadvantages for measuring impact are discussed.`,issn: `1751-1577`,journal: `Journal of Informetrics`,keywords: `Altmetrics,Broader impact,Scientometrics,Societal impact`,number: `4`,pages: `1--24`,title: `Do altmetrics point to the broader impact of research?

  {key: `2014_bornmann`,type: `article`,author: `Lutz Bornmann`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Can altmetric data be validly used for the measurement of societal impact? The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag "good for teaching" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented ("new finding"). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact.If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1406.7611`,doi: `10.1016/j.joi.2014.09.007`,eprint: `1406.7611`,issn: `18755879`,journal: `Journal of Informetrics`,keywords: `Altmetrics,Bibliometrics,F1000,Societal impact,Twitter`,number: `4`,pages: `935--950`,publisher: `Elsevier Ltd`,title: `Validity of altmetrics data for measuring societal impact: A study using data from Altmetric and F1000Prime`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.09.007`,volume: `8`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Bibliometry/Altmetrics/2014 Validity of Altmetrics Data for Measuring Societal Impact_a Study Using Data from Altmetric and F1000Prime  2014BornmannValidity.pdf`},
  {key: `2014_bilbao_etal`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,author: `Stefan Bilbao and Alberto Torin and Vasileios Chatziioannou`,translator: ` `,abstract: `Collisions play an important role in many aspects of the physics of musical instruments. The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and percussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others include reed-beating eﬀects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction in fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the wire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective, whether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or sound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various diﬃculties, not the least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a novel ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain simulation framework for such collision problems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical energy conservation or dissipation, and where a a power law formulation for collisions is employed, as a potential function within a Hamiltonian formulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and as a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. This formulation solves a major problem underlying previous work, where a Hamiltonian framework was not employed for collisions, and thus stability was not ensured. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of such methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are presented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation, bounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as various aspects of musical instrument physics.`,eprint: `1405.2589`,eprinttype: `arxiv`,journal: `arXiv:1405.2589 [math]`,langid: `english`,title: `Numerical Modeling of Collisions in Musical Instruments`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2589`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,year: `2014`,tags: `tesse`},

  {key: `2014_bengio`,type: `article`,author: `Yoshua Bengio`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `We propose to exploit /em reconstruction as a layer-local training signal for deep learning. Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them, flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1407.7906`,eprint: `1407.7906`,pages: `1--34`,title: `How Auto-Encoders Could Provide Credit Assignment in Deep Networks via Target Propagation`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7906`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/2014 How Auto-Encoders Could Provide Credit Assignment in Deep Networks via Target Propagation.pdf`},

These equations were optimized using thermodynamic data of 290 and 141 organic compounds for Hbo,0, and \$/Delta\$Hbo(T), respectively. Given the yields of bio-oil, char, and gas, elemental compositions of the bio-oil and char, and chemical composition of the gas, proposed equations predict the heat required for biomass pyrolysis, Qpy(Tpy), which is defined as the enthalpy difference between the products at the pyrolysis temperature, Tpy, and the biomass at 298.15 K. The predicted Qpy at Tpy = 773–823 K for five different types of dry biomass was in the range of 1.1–1.6 MJ kg–1.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1011.1669v3`,eprint: `1011.1669v3`,isbn: `17571693`,issn: `09619534`,journal: `Biomass and Bioenergy`,keywords: `2013,Accelerated ageing,Adsorption,Allothermal,Anaerobic digestion,Automation,Bio oil,Bio-oil,Biochar,Biochar soil amendment,Bioenergy efficiency,Biological degradation,Biomass,Biomass CHP,Biomass conversion,Biotechnology,Biotechnology: methods,Bott,Carbon markets,Carbon sequestration,Char and Energy,Characterization,Charcoal,Charcoal: chemistry,Coffee,Composting,Cyprus,Economic tradeoff,Economical analysis,Energy policy,Equilibrium moisture content,Fast pyrolysis,Feasibility,Feedstock,Forest residue,Gasification,Hot Temperature,Life cycle assessment,Long-term stability,Mobile,Norwegian framework conditions,Oils,Oils: chemistry,Oryza sativa,Oryza sativa: chemistry,Oxidative treatment,PAH,Packed bed reactor,Particles,Pyrolysis,Pyrolysis conditions,Pyrolysis-biochar systems,Recycling,Residue,Sewage,Sewage: chemistry,Simulation,Slow pyrolysis,Soil conditioning,Soil quality improvement,Sub Saharan Africa,Tar,Techno-economics,Thermogravimetry,Torrefaction,Waste Products,Waste Products: analysis,abstract,acetylene,and,and accepted 6 september,bio-char,biochar,biomass,biomass pyroly-,biomass pyrolysis process an,block diagram,caloric requirement,carbon sequestration,differential dtg method and,drying,dsc analyzer,eb,eb and esd pyrolysis,economic bene fi t,economically viable option,el,energy balance,engineering,esd,ethylene,eucalyptus bark,eucalyptus residues,eucalyptus sawdust,figure i is a,food waste valorization,for optimum utilization of,have been divided using,heat balance,heating rate,heating value,higher heating value,icle,keywords,kinetic,kinetics of eucalyptus leaves,labile carbon,lumber storage,mass balance,methane,msw,municipal solid waste,natural gas,ns,ole,oxidative pyrolysis,partial oxidation,physicochemical properties,products to make the,pyrolysis,pyrolysis products,reaction,received 2 august 2013,sis,stable carbon,synthesis gas,technique,techno-economic assessment,temperature,tg,tga,the,the pyrolysis behaviors and,there is a need,thermogravimetric analysis,three stages for el,wastewater treatment,were investigated by using,MSW`,number: `1`,pages: `1--10`,pmid: `15003161`,title: `Manuscript-grant-writing`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.06.023%255Cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2012.03.002%255Cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.07.023%255Cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.02.054%255Cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.`,volume: `5`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/One picture is worth a thousand words. - Hanauer.pdf`},

  {key: `2014_abdelnour_etal`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Farras Abdelnour and Henning U. Voss and Ashish Raj`,abstract: `The relationship between anatomic connectivity of large-scale brain networks and their functional connectivity is of immense importance and an area of active research. Previous attempts have required complex simulations which model the dynamics of each cortical region, and explore the coupling between regions as derived by anatomic connections. While much insight is gained from these non-linear simulations, they can be computationally taxing tools for predicting functional from anatomic connectivities. Little attention has been paid to linear models. Here we show that a properly designed linear model appears to be superior to previous non-linear approaches in capturing the brain's long-range second order correlation structure that governs the relationship between anatomic and functional connectivities. We derive a linear network of brain dynamics based on graph diffusion, whereby the diffusing quantity undergoes a random walk on a graph. We test our model using subjects who underwent diffusion MRI and resting state fMRI. The network diffusion model applied to the structural networks largely predicts the correlation structures derived from their fMRI data, to a greater extent than other approaches. The utility of the proposed approach is that it can routinely be used to infer functional correlation from anatomic connectivity. And since it is linear, anatomic connectivity can also be inferred from functional data. The success of our model confirms the linearity of ensemble average signals in the brain, and implies that their long-range correlation structure may percolate within the brain via purely mechanistic processes enacted on its structural connectivity pathways. /textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.`,doi: `10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.039`,issn: `10959572`,journal: `NeuroImage`,keywords: `Brain connectivity,Functional connectivity,Networks,Structural connectivity`,pages: `335--347`,pmid: `24384152`,publisher: `Elsevier Inc.`,title: `Network diffusion accurately models the relationship between structural and functional brain connectivity networks`,url: `http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.039`,volume: `90`,year: `2014`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/allocate/2014 Network diffusion accurately models the relationship between structural and functional brain connectivity networks.pdf`},

However, in some cases, these constraints may be inequalities. The EIV model with inequality constraints has not been fully investigated. Therefore, this paper presents an inequality-constrained total least squares (ICTLS) solution for the EIV model with inequality constraints (denoted as ICEIV). Employing the proposed ICTLS method, the ICEIV problem is first converted into an equality-constrained problem by distinguishing the active constraints through exhaustive searching, and it is then resolved employing the method of equality-constrained total least squares (ECTLS). The applicability and feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated in two examples. /textcopyright 2012 Springer-Verlag.`,doi: `10.1007/s00190-012-0575-2`,issn: `09497714`,journal: `Journal of Geodesy`,keywords: `Active constraints,Errors-in-variables model,Exhaustive searching,Inequality constraints,Total least squares`,number: `1`,pages: `23--28`,title: `A solution to EIV model with inequality constraints and its geodetic applications`,volume: `87`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Least mean squares/Zhang2013_Article_ASolutionToEIVModelWithInequal.pdf`},

Zadpoor and Dimitra Dodou`,editor: ` `,abstract: `Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) are prominent citation services with distinct indexing mechanisms. Comprehensive knowledge about the growth patterns of these two citation services is lacking. We analyzed the development of citation counts in WoS and GS for two classic articles and 56 articles from diverse research ﬁelds, making a distinction between retroactive growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in mid-2005 and citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013) and actual growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013 and citation counts up to April 2013 measured in April 2013). One of the classic articles was used for a citation-by-citation analysis. Results showed that GS has substantially grown in a retroactive manner (median of 170 /////// % across articles), especially for articles that initially had low citations counts in GS as compared to WoS. Retroactive growth of WoS was small, with a median of 2 /////// % across articles. Actual growth percentages were moderately higher for GS than for WoS (medians of 54 vs. 41 /////// %). The citation-by-citation analysis showed that the percentage of citations being unique in WoS was lower for more recent citations (6.8 /////// % for citations from 1995 and later vs. 41 /////// % for citations from before 1995), whereas the opposite was noted for GS (57 vs. 33 /////// %).

"Creative composition"-composing in your own style, rather than in the style of a composer of the past-is embraced by music educators not only for composition students, but for beginning performers and music educators, and is often offered to all music students and non-music majors who wish to enhance their musical creativity. With 25 years of experience teaching fledgling composers, the author tackles the key ingredients that make for successful composition, including: stimulus to the musical imagination; discussion of a variety of current musical languages; analysis of many examples from contemporary scores; technical exercises; suggestions as to how to start a composition; structures; and examinations of works from particular genres. Wilkins covers several musical languages, from folk and popular to serialism; analyses various rhythmic forms; suggests approaches for composing for a variety of instruments, from traditional to electronic ones, as well as for the human voice; addresses the nuts and bolts of score preparation; and offers career advice.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.`,doi: `10.1371/journal.pone.0064841`,issn: `1932-6203`,journal: `PLoS ONE`,keywords: `bibliometry`,month: `may`,number: `5`,pages: `e64841`,publisher: `Public Library of Science (PLoS)`,shorttitle: `Do Altmetrics Work?`,title: `Do Altmetrics Work?

Articles from Game Theory Tuesdays have been referenced in The Freakonomics Blog, Yahoo Finance, and CNN.com. Game theory is the study of interactive decision making--that is, in situations where each person's action affects the outcome for the whole group. Game theory is a beautiful subject and this book will teach you how to understand the theory and practically implement solutions through a series of stories and the aid of over 30 illustrations. This book has two primary objectives. (1) To help you recognize strategic games, like the Prisoner's Dilemma, Bertrand Duopoly, Hotelling's Game, the Game of Chicken, and Mutually Assured Destruction. (2) To show you how to make better decisions and change the game, a powerful concept that can transform no-win situations into mutually beneficial outcomes. You'll learn how to negotiate better by making your threats credible, sometimes limiting options or burning bridges, and thinking about new ways to create better outcomes. As these goals indicate, game theory is about more than board games and gambling. It all seems so simple, and yet that definition belies the complexity of game theory. While it may only take seconds to get a sense of game theory, it takes a lifetime to appreciate and master it.

In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.

These models are formulated as linear or log-linear interpolations of up to five sub-models, each of which is responsible for modeling a different type of relation. The ability of the models to predict symbolic pitch data is evaluated in terms of their cross-entropy, and of a newly proposed 'contextual cross-entropy' measure. Their performance is then measured on synthesized polyphonic audio signals in terms of the accuracy of multiple pitch estimation in combination with a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization-based acoustic model. In both experiments, the log-linear combination of at least one 'vertical' (e.g., harmony) and one 'horizontal' (e.g., note duration) sub-model outperformed a pitch-dependent Bernoulli prior by more than 60% in relative cross-entropy and 3% in absolute multiple pitch estimation accuracy.

  {key: `2013_philp_etal1`,type: `article`,author: `Jim C Philp and Alex Bartsev and  Re and Rachael J Ritchie and Marie Ange Baucher and K Guy`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Society is fundamentally ambivalent to the use of plastics. On the one hand, plastics are uniquely flexible materials that have seen them occupy a huge range of functions, from simple packing materials to complex engineering components. On the other hand, their durability has raised concerns about their end-of-life disposal. When that disposal route is landfill, their invulnerability to microbial decomposition, combined with relatively low density and high bulk, means that plastics will occupy increasing amounts of landfill space in a world where available suitable landfill sites is shrinking.The search for biodegradable plastics and their introduction to the marketplace would appear to be a suitable amelioration strategy for such a problem. And yet the uptake of biodegradable plastics has been slow. The term biodegradable itself has entered public controversy, with accidental and intended misuse of the term; the intended misuse has led to accusations and instances of 'greenwashing'. For this and other reasons standards for biodegradability and compostability testing of plastics have been sought.An environmental dilemma with more far-reaching implications is climate change. The need for rapid and deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts is one of the drivers for the resurgence of industrial biotechnology generally, and the search for bio-based plastics more specifically. Bio-based has come to mean plastics based on renewable resources, but this need not necessarily imply biodegradability. If the primary purpose is GHG emissions savings, then once again plastics durability can be a virtue, if the end-of-life solution can be energy recovery during incineration or recycling. The pattern of production is shifting from the true biodegradable plastics to the bio-based plastics, and that trend is likely to persist into the future.This paper looks at aspects of the science of biodegradable and bio-based plastics from the perspective of policy advisers and makers. It is often said that the bioplastics suffer from a lack of a favourable policy regime when compared to the wide-ranging set of policy instruments that are available on both the supply and demand side of biofuels production. Some possible policy measures are discussed. /textcopyright2012 Elsevier B.V.`,doi: `10.1016/j.nbt.2012.11.021`,issn: `18716784`,journal: `New Biotechnology`,number: `6`,pages: `635--646`,pmid: `23220474`,title: `Bioplastics science from a policy vantage point`,url: `https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1871678412008783`,volume: `30`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/2013 Bioplastics science from a policy vantage point - Philp et al..pdf`},

Methods: Data from the second national health survey were considered in this investigation. This data includes the information of low back pain and its associated risk factors among Iranian people aged 15 years and older. Artificial neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a set of 17294 data and they were validated in a test set of 17295 data. Hosmer and Lemeshow recommendation for model selection was used in fitting the logistic regression. A three-layer perceptron with 9 inputs, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons was employed. The efficiency of two models was compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, root mean square and -2 Loglikelihood criteria. Results: The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the logistic regression was 0.752 (0.004), 0.3832 and 14769.2, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the artificial neural network was 0.754 (0.004), 0.3770 and 14757.6, respectively. Conclusions: Based on these three criteria, artificial neural network would give better performance than logistic regression. Although, the difference is statistically significant, it does not seem to be clinically significant.`,journal: `Iranian Journal of Public Health`,langid: `english`,pages: `8`,title: `Comparison of Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network in Low Back Pain Prediction: Second National Health Survey`,year: `2013`,tags: `tesse`},

Nacher and Tatsuya Akutsu`,abstract: `E investigate the role of nodes when a minimum dominating set (MDS) approach is considered in controlling a network. We present an algorithmic procedure to compute the critical and redundant nodes using the MDS. The theoretical analysis for scale-free networks shows that (1) high-degree nodes tend to be critical nodes and (2) for scaling exponent gamma>2, such probability increases when gamma grows. These relationships are confirmed by computer simulations. Furthermore, our computational experiments also show that the MDS is unimodal when the average degree left grows. It means that most nodes are redundant for high-degree, therefore one can achieve control through a small set of nodes, highlighting a centralized control feature. The analysis of a set of real-world networks confirms the findings observed in simulation experiments. In particular, the U.S. airport network shows a more centralized control, whereas the Italy's nationwide power grid network exhibits a more distributed control. The human protein-protein interaction network exerts control with a configuration between both man-made networks. /textcopyright 2013 IEEE.`,doi: `10.1109/SITIS.2013.106`,isbn: `9781479932115`,journal: `Proceedings - 2013 International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems, SITIS 2013`,keywords: `Complex networks,Controllability,Critical nodes`,pages: `649--654`,title: `Analysis on critical nodes in controlling complex networks using dominating sets`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/Valerie and Patrick Hastie - Tibshirani and Friedman.PDF`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1011.1669v3`,eprint: `1011.1669v3`,isbn: `9788578110796`,issn: `1098-6596`,journal: `Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling`,keywords: `icle`,number: `9`,pages: `1689--1699`,pmid: `25246403`,title: `Mechanical engineering handbook`,volume: `53`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/1999 Mechanical Engineering Handbook - Kreith.pdf`},

It is argued that longstanding methods of conceptualizing music are vulnerable to Deleuze's critique. But, as Deleuze himself stresses, more important than merely critiquing established paradigms is developing ways to overcome them, and by using Deleuze's own concepts this collection aims to explore that possibility.`,doi: `10.1093/fs/kns009`,isbn: `9781409412090`,issn: `0016-1128`,journal: `Sounding the Virtual: Gilles Deleuze and the Theory and Philosophy of Music`,pages: `1--288`,title: `Sounding the virtual: Gilles Deleuze and the theory and philosophy of music`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Music/2010 Sounding the virtual - Gilles Deleuze and the theory and philosophy of music - Hulse et al.pdf`},

Electronic searches in MEDLINE, Cochrane and LILACS, without language restrictions were conducted. Additionally, unpublished literature was identified. Randomized controlled trials, or controlled clinical trials, comparing interventions applied to manage anterior open bite and other muscle functions such as breathing/swallowing pattern and tongue resting position and pressure, were considered. Quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to assess treatment effects. From the 265 initial search results, 15 articles were included in the review. Eight were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 were controlled clinical trials. Treatment outcomes comprised skeletal and dentoalveolar changes recorded cephalometrically, mouth posture and lip closure normalization, improvement of tongue resting position/pressure and modification of swallowing pattern. Quantitative synthesis was possible for only 2 of the included RCTs. There was no evidence to support bonded lingual spurs over banded fixed appliances for the correction of anterior open bite in mixed dentition children presenting nonnutritive oral habits at the onset of treatment (SMD: -0.03; 95%CI: -.81, 0.74; P = 0.94).

But craftsmen do not always have the means to embark, by themselves, on an innovation strategy. The idea is to try to respond to current challenges in instrument making; for example, the reduction in costs of design times or the adaptation to customer needs. All of this necessitates the development of low cost tools for characterising and prototyping of instruments dedicated to their use in workshops. Examples of collaborative approach between instrument makers and research laboratories are presented. Mainly, the PAFI project, for "Instrument-making Aid Platform" aims to develop characterisation tools for all the instrument families. The initiative’s originality lies in the fact that "pilot craftsmen" are associated with every stage of development. The process involves a research program and the support of craftsmen for developing the hardware and software. Bearing in mind the international economic context, these experiences may act as a basis for broadening and pursuing this initiative on an international scale. The open and progressive nature of the work means that we can consider such a prospect with a view to maintaining the smallscale production of high-quality instruments.`,doi: `10.1051/epn/2013601`,issn: `0531-7479, 1432-1092`,journal: `Europhysics News`,langid: `english`,number: `6`,pages: `21--24`,title: `An eye-witness report on how the CD came about`,urldate: `2019-04-05`,volume: `44`,year: `2013`,tags: `tesse`},

Musical examples and specific musical instruments demonstrate the principles. The book begins with a study of vibrations and waves, in that order. These topics constitute the basic physical properties of sound, one of two pillars supporting the science of musical acoustics. The second pillar is the human element, the physiological and psychological aspects of acoustical science. The perceptual topics include loudness, pitch, tone color, and localization of sound. With these two pillars in place, it is possible to go in a variety of directions. The book treats in turn, the topics of room acoustics, audio both analog and digital, broadcasting, and speech. It ends with chapters on the traditional musical instruments, organized by family. The mathematical level of this book assumes that the reader is familiar with elementary algebra. Trigonometric functions, logarithms and powers also appear in the book, but computational techniques are included as these concepts are introduced, and there is further technical help in appendices.`,isbn: `9781461467854`,pages: `352`,title: `Principles of Musical Acoustics`,url: `http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4614-6786-1`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Acoustics/2013 Principles of Musical Acoustics - Hartmann.pdf`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1011.1669v3`,eprint: `1011.1669v3`,isbn: `9788578110796`,issn: `1098-6596`,journal: `Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling`,keywords: `icle`,number: `9`,pages: `1689--1699`,pmid: `25246403`,publisher: `O'Reilly UK Ltd.`,title: `Hands-On Programming with R`,url: `https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly///////%5C%5C_HandsOn///////%5C%5C_Programming///////%5C%5C_with///////%5C%5C_R///////%5C%5C_2014.pdf`,volume: `53`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Artificial Intelligence/2018 Reinforcement learning - an introduction - Sutton et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1011.1669v3`,eprint: `1011.1669v3`,isbn: `9788578110796`,issn: `1098-6596`,journal: `Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling`,keywords: `icle`,number: `9`,pages: `1689--1699`,pmid: `25246403`,title: `Chinese Mythology`,volume: `53`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Mythology/2009 Chinese Mythology A to Z - Jeremy Roberts.pdf`},

  {key: `2013_deserio`,type: `article`,author: `Robert DeSerio`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `How duplicate genes provide genetic robustness remains an unresolved question. We have examined the duplicated histone deacetylases Sir2p and Hst1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find that these paralogs with non-overlapping functions can provide genetic robustness against null mutations through a substitution mechanism. Hst1p is an NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase that acts with Sum1p to repress a subset of midsporulation genes. However, hst1Delta mutants show much weaker derepression of target loci than sum1Delta mutants. We show that this modest derepression of target loci in hst1Delta strains occurs in part because Sir2p substitutes for Hst1p. Sir2p contributes to repression of the midsporulation genes only in the absence of Hst1p and is recruited to target promoters by a physical interaction with the Sum1 complex. Furthermore, when Sir2p associates with the Sum1 complex, the complex continues to repress in a promoter-specific manner and does not spread. Our results imply that after the duplication, SIR2 and HST1 subfunctionalized. The single SIR2/HST1 gene from Kluyveromyces lactis, a closely related species that diverged prior to the duplication, can suppress an hst1Delta mutation in S. cerevisiae as well as interact with Sir4p in S. cerevisiae. In addition, the existence of two distinct protein interaction domains for the Sir and Sum1 complexes was revealed through the analysis of a chimeric Sir2-Hst1 molecule. Therefore, the ability of Sir2p to substitute for Hst1p probably results from a retained but reduced affinity for the Sum1 complex that is a consequence of subfunctionalization via the duplication, degeneration, and complementation mechanism. These results suggest that the evolutionary path of duplicate gene preservation may be an important indicator for the ability of duplicated genes to contribute to genetic robustness.`,issn: `1553-7404`,number: `6`,title: `Addendum: The Fourier transform of decaying oscillations (Ilidio Notes)`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Harmonic Analysis/! 2017 Addendum _ the Fourier Transform of Decaying Oscillations_2017DeSerioAddendum.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random 'dropout' procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system.

However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects. /textcopyright 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.`,doi: `10.1007/s10844-013-0258-3`,issn: `09259902`,journal: `Journal of Intelligent Information Systems`,keywords: `Automatic music transcription,Music information retrieval,Music signal analysis`,number: `3`,pages: `407--434`,title: `Automatic music transcription: Challenges and future directions`,volume: `41`,year: `2013`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Music/Transcription/2013 Automatic music transcription challenges and future directions - Benetos et al..pdf`},

From one side, games are rich and challenging domains for testing reinforcement learning algorithms. From the other side, in several games the best computer players use reinforcement learning. The chapter begins with a selection of games and notable reinforcement learning implementations.Without any modifications, the basic reinforcement learning algorithms are rarely sufficient for high-level gameplay, so it is essential to discuss the additional ideas, ways of inserting domain knowledge, implementation decisions that are necessary for scaling up. These are reviewed in sufficient detail to understand their potentials and their limitations. The second part of the chapter lists challenges for reinforcement learning in games, together with a review of proposed solution methods. While this listing has a game-centric viewpoint, and some of the items are specific to games (like opponent modelling), a large portion of this overview can provide insight for other kinds of applications, too. In the third part we review how reinforcement learning can be useful in game development and find its way into commercial computer games. Finally, we provide pointers for more in-depth reviews of specific games and solution approaches.`,isbn: `9783642015267`,issn: `18674542`,keywords: `Coherence,Covariance,Defend,Income,Nash`,pages: `539--577`,title: `Reinforcement learning: adaptation, learning, and Optimization, Volume 12`,volume: `12`,year: `2012`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/2012 Reinforcement Learning - Wiering and van Otterlo.pdf`},

  {key: `2012_speed`,type: `phdthesis`,editor: ` `,author: `Matthew David Adam Speed`,translator: ` `,abstract: `The acoustic response of the vocal tract is fundamental to our interpretation of voice production. As an acoustic filter, it shapes the spectral envelope of vocal fold vibration towards resonant modes, or formants, whose behaviours form the most basic building blocks of phonetics. Physical models of the voice exploit this effect by modelling the nature of wave propagation in abstracted cylindrical constructs. Whilst effective, the accuracy of such approaches is limited due to their limited geometrical analogue. Developments in numerical acoustics modelling meanwhile have seen the formalisation of higher dimensionality configurations of the same technologies, allowing a much closer geometrical representation of an acoustic field. The major focus of this thesis is the application of such a technique to the vocal tract, and comparison of its performance with lower dimensionality approaches. To afford the development of such models, a body of data is collected from Magnetic Resonance Imaging for a range of subjects, and procedures are developed for the decomposition of this imaging into suitable, efficient data structures for simulation. The simulation technique is exhaustively validated using a combination of bespoke measurement/inversion techniques and analytical determination of lower frequency behaviours. Finally, voice synthesis based on each numerical model is compared with acoustic recordings of the subjects involved and with equivalent simulations from lower dimensionality methods. It is found that application of a higher dimensionality method typically yields a more accurate frequency-domain representation of the voice, although in some cases lower dimensionality equivalents are seen to perform better at low frequencies.`,adsnote: `Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System`,adsurl: `http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PhDT.......545S`,institution: `University of York`,school: `The University of York (United Kingdom`,title: `Voice Synthesis Using the Three-Dimensional Digital Waveguide Mesh`,url: `http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2800/`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,year: `2012`,tags: `tesse`},

We discuss the difference between a linear and a non-linear model of information-extraction from the envelope, and show that using a non-linear method for information-extraction, it is possible to obtain almost all information about the originating signal. This is shown mathematically and numerically for different kinds of systems providing an increasingly better approximation to the auditory system.

  {key: `2012_pizarro_etal`,type: `inproceedings`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Jorge Oscar De Sant Anna Pizarro and Celso Cesar Moreira Branco`,abstract: `Carbonate reservoirs contain expressive part of the world oil reserves. The exploitation of these resources, however, presents several challenges mainly associated with their complex pore geometry, large scale variation in permeability and sometimes unfavorable wettability. These challenges can become more significant when we move to a deep offshore environment. As offshore projects need to be planned well in advance, due to the lack of room in the platforms for future expansion, the pioneer application of EOR methods needs to be considered from the conceptual stage of the development. This paper addresses the approach used to design the development basis for Lula field, formerly known as Tupi area, in the Pre-Salt Cluster (SBPSC) in Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. It focuses on the strategy of phased development, dynamic data acquisition and actions to add flexibility to the production system and how to manage uncertainties. A comprehensive analysis of the existing uncertainties, such as the reservoir characterization, early water and gas breakthrough, bypassed oil saturation, flow assurance in deep water flowlines and CaCO 3 scale possibility in production wells, favored a phased development concept aiming to mitigate risks.. The approach used to cope with these uncertainties in a Pilot Project as well as in the future development scenarios is presented. Most of the discussion is focused on how to consider feasible Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques through Pilot testing and future implementation in large scale in the field. It comprises the investigation of different recovery processes and first field results, including miscible processes using hydrocarbon gas and CO2. To optimize the oil displacement, a water alternating gas (WAG) injection process is also being designed. After one and a half year of extended well test production and the implementation of the first Pilot project in January, 2011, results confirm the decision of providing additional flexibility to the project. Dynamic appraisal proved essential to assess reservoir connectivity, evaluate stimulation methods, support reservoir characterization studies and define aspects related to flow in subsea lines. The first results of the injection of the CO2 stream, separated from the associated gas in the Pilot project, indicate that the chosen strategy has potential to be a successful one. The continuing production and pressure data monitoring of the WAG implementation in the Pilot, from 2012 on, will provide a more definitive conclusion about the feasibility. Good responses will translate in the EOR expansion to field scale.

Methods: Data from the second national health survey were considered in this investigation. This data includes the information of low back pain and its associated risk factors among Iranian people aged 15 years and older. Artificial neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a set of 17294 data and they were validated in a test set of 17295 data. Hosmer and Lemeshow recommendation for model selection was used in fitting the logistic regression. A three-layer perceptron with 9 inputs, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons was employed. The efficiency of two models was compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, root mean square and -2 Loglikelihood criteria. Results: The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the logistic regression was 0.752 (0.004), 0.3832 and 14769.2, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the artificial neural network was 0.754 (0.004), 0.3770 and 14757.6, respectively. Conclusions: Based on these three criteria, artificial neural network would give better performance than logistic regression.

In this study, a trend was identified towards significant improvement of patients' quality of life (Qol) as well as a significant reduction of caregivers' psychosocial burden and need for help. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the PEPP in clinical practice as compared with the RCT in an academic setting. The second aim is to assess its effectiveness in clinical practice at 6-month follow-up. Methods: Fifty-five patients and 50 caregivers from nine clinical settings participated in the PEPP consisting of eight weekly sessions of 90 min. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess patients' Qol (PDQ-39) and caregivers' psychosocial burden and need for help (BELA-A-k) at baseline, directly after the programme and at 6-month follow-up. To compare the baseline data and short-term effects, data were used from an RCT study which included 64 Parkinson's disease patients and 46 caregivers. Results: Compared with the RCT control group, significant effects, after Bonferoni adjustment, were found for patients' Qol as well as for caregivers' psychosocial burden and need for help. No significant changes were found between baseline scores compared with 6-month follow-up. Scores returned to baseline levels at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: Effects from the RCT study were replicated and the effect on patients' Qol was now significant. However, at 6-month follow-up, scores returned to baseline levels, indicating the need for some form of a booster session.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1011.1669v3`,eprint: `1011.1669v3`,isbn: `9788578110796`,issn: `1098-6596`,pages: `893`,pmid: `25246403`,title: `Fundamentals of Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems`,year: `2012`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Mathematics/Differential Equations/2012 Fundamentals of differential equations - Nagle et al.pdf`},

The microbial carbonate reservoir is unusual regarding its origin and petrophysical properties; the fluids have a variable CO2 content; the few analogue reservoirs around the world do not compare in terms of volumes, water depth and distance to the coast; and there are also flow assurance issues. Considering the importance of these reserves for the Brazilian economy and the opportunity to accelerate cash flow, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a fast track development, including extended well tests (EWTs) and production pilots. The current Petrobras Business Plan (2011-15) foresees mat the SBPSC areas alone will produce over 500,000 boe/d in 2015 and over 1,100,000 boe/d in 2020. These numbers refer only to Petrobras share and do not include me transfer of rights with economic compensation from the Brazilian government to Petrobras. Therefore, the initial development phase will have to cope with several uncertainties, mainly the subsurface ones. Some of the most relevant are the quality and the heterogeneity degree of each reservoir zone; the compositional grading of the fluids; the performance of different EOR methods; and the presence of fractures affecting the flow. How to specify and anticipate the acquisition of expensive equipment, such as FPSOs and subsea devices, with uncertainties to be clarified? When is it worth to invest in more data acquisition, such as EWTs, core and fluid sampling, extensive lab analysis or even more appraisal wells? The timing and the uncertainty reduction foreseen for each initiative must be taken into account. On the other hand, when is it better to pay for extra flexibilities, accepting the inevitable CAPEX increase? Some examples would be: smart completions and possibility to inject different chemical products in the wells; gas and water separated lines for each satellite injector; flexible subsea layout, allowing multiples strategies and the addition of more wells; FPSO plants designed to inject desulphated water, or to export, import or reinject me gas, and also to separate variable CO2 contents in the produced fluids. This paper aims to discuss the influence of the main subsurface uncertainties in the selection of alternatives to develop the giant fields in the SBPSC, in a fast track way.

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

Spatio- and spectro-temporal data (SSTD) are the most common data collected to measure brain signals and brain activities, along with the recently obtained gene and protein data. Yet, there are no computational models to integrate all these different types of data into a single model to help understand brain processes and for a better brain signal pattern recognition. The EU FP7 Marie Curie IIF EvoSpike project develops methods and tools for spatio and spectro temporal pattern recognition. This paper proposes a new evolving spiking model called NeuCube as part of the EvoSpike project, especially for modeling brain data. The NeuCube is 3D evolving Neurogenetic Brain Cube of spiking neurons that is an approximate map of structural and functional areas of interest of an animal or human brain. Optionally, gene information is included in the NeuCube in the form of gene regulatory networks that relate to spiking neuronal parameters of interest. Different types of brain SSTD can be used to train a NeuCube, including: EEG, fMRI, video-, image- and sound data, complex multimodal data. Potential applications are: EEG -, fMRI-, and multimodal brain data modeling and pattern recognition; Brain-Computer Interfaces; cognitive and emotional robots; neuro-prosthetics and neuro-rehabilitation; modeling brain diseases. Analysis of the internal structure of the model can trigger new hypotheses about spatio-temporal pathways in the brain. /textcopyright 2012 Springer-Verlag.`,doi: `10.1007/978-3-642-33212-8_21`,isbn: `9783642332111`,issn: `03029743`,journal: `Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)`,keywords: `EEG,computational neuro-genetic modelling,evolving neurogenetic brain cube,fMRI,gene regulatory networks,pattern recognition,personalized modeling,probabilistic modeling,spatio/spectro-temporal brain data,spiking neural networks`,organization: `Springer`,pages: `225--243`,title: `NeuCube EvoSpike architecture for spatio-temporal modelling and pattern recognition of brain signals`,volume: `7477 LNAI`,year: `2012`},

Statistical methods for partial rankings have been discussed in the literature. However, there has been relatively little published on their Fourier analysis, perhaps because the abstract nature of the transforms involved impede insight. This paper provides as its novel contributions an analysis of the Fourier transform for partial rankings, with particular attention to the first three ranks, while emphasizing on basic signal processing properties of transform magnitude and phase. It shows that the transform and its magnitude satisfy a projection invariance and analyzes the reconstruction of data from either magnitude or phase alone. The analysis is motivated by appealing to corresponding properties of the familiar DFT and by application to two real-world data sets.`,doi: `10.1155/2012/579050`,issn: `1687-9562`,journal: `Advances in Numerical Analysis`,pages: `1--15`,title: `Interpreting the Phase Spectrum in Fourier Analysis of Partial Ranking Data`,volume: `2012`,year: `2012`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Harmonic Analysis/Fourier Transform/2012 Interpreting the Phase Spectrum in Fourier Analysis of Partial Ranking Data - Kakarala.pdf`},

Music accompaniment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace, because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method. Evaluations on the MIR-1K dataset show that this method can achieve around 1∼1.4 dB higher GNSDR compared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior training or requiring particular features.`,doi: `10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287816`,eventtitle: `ICASSP 2012 - 2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing`,isbn: `978146730046997814673004529781467300445`,journal: `2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)`,langid: `english`,location: `Kyoto, Japan`,pages: `57--60`,publisher: `IEEE`,title: `Singing-voice separation from monaural recordings using robust principal component analysis`,url: `http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6287816/`,urldate: `2021-01-15`,year: `2012`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/2012 Singing-voice separation from monaural recordings using robust principal component analysis - Huang et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged,#corrupted author`},

Given measured data, we establish a relationship between independent and dependent variables so that we can use the data predictively. The main concern of Least Squares Data Fitting with Applications is how to do this on a computer with efficient and robust computational methods for linear and nonlinear relationships. The presentation also establishes a link between the statistical setting and the computational issues. In a number of applications, the accuracy and efficiency of the least squares fit is central, and Per Christian Hansen, V/'ictor Pereyra, and Godela Scherer survey modern computational methods and illustrate them in fields ranging from engineering and environmental sciences to geophysics. Anyone working with problems of linear and nonlinear least squares fitting will find this book invaluable as a hands-on guide, with accessible text and carefully explained problems.

How does Radiohead's "Just" relate to the improvisations of Bill Evans? And how do Chopin's works exploit the non-Euclidean geometry of musical chords? In this groundbreaking work, author Dmitri Tymoczko describes a new framework for thinking about music that emphasizes the commonalities among styles from medieval polyphony to contemporary rock. Tymoczko identifies five basic musical features that jointly contribute to the sense of tonality, and shows how these features recur throughout the history of Western music. In the process he sheds new light on an age-old question: what makes music sound good? A Geometry of Music provides an accessible introduction to Tymoczko's revolutionary geometrical approach to music theory. The book shows how to construct simple diagrams representing relationships among familiar chords and scales, giving readers the tools to translate between the musical and visual realms and revealing surprising degrees of structure in otherwise hard-to-understand pieces. Tymoczko uses this theoretical foundation to retell the history of Western music from the eleventh century to the present day. Arguing that traditional histories focus too narrowly on the "common practice" period from 1680-1850, he proposes instead that Western music comprises an extended common practice stretching from the late middle ages to the present. He discusses a host of familiar pieces by a wide range of composers, from Bach to the Beatles, Mozart to Miles Davis, and many in between. A Geometry of Music is accessible to a range of readers, from undergraduate music majors to scientists and mathematicians with an interest in music. Defining its terms along the way, it presupposes no special mathematical background and only a basic familiarity with Western music theory. The book also contains exercises designed to reinforce and extend readers' understanding, along with a series of appendices that explore the technical details of this exciting new theory.`,doi: `10.1215/0961754x-1630505`,isbn: `9780195336672`,issn: `0961-754X`,journal: `Common Knowledge`,number: `3`,pages: `552--553`,title: `A Geometry of Music: Harmony and Counterpoint in the Extended Common Practice`,volume: `18`,year: `2012`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Music/2011 A geometry of music - harmony and counterpoint in the extended common practice - Tymoczko.pdf`},

In his first book, The Daily Adventures of Mixerman , the author detailed the frustrating and often hilarious goings on during the process of recording a major-label band. Musicians, engineers, and producers laughed and cried at the crazy goings-on they'd never imagined or recognized all too well. Now Mixerman turns his razor-sharp gaze to the art of mixing and gives followers and the uninitiated reason to hope if not for logic and civility in the recording studio then at least for a good sounding record. With a firm commitment to art over technology and to maintaining a grasp of each, Mixerman outlines his own approach to recording success, based on his years mixing records in all genres of music for all kinds of artists, often under trying circumstances. As he states in his introduction to the new volume, "Even if you're not a professional mixer, even if you're a musician trying to mix your own work or a studio owner in a smaller market, you have your own set of pressures to deal with while you're mixing. Regardless of what those pressures are, it's important to identify and recognize them, if for no other reason than so you can learn to completely ignore them." But how?

Hudspeth, PhDA Doody's Core Title for 2017!900 full-color illustrationsDeciphering the link between the human brain and behavior has always been one of the most intriguing―and often challenging―aspects of scientific endeavor. The sequencing of the human genome, and advances in molecular biology, have illuminated the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases and have propelled our knowledge of how the brain controls behavior.To grasp the wider implications of these developments and gain a fundamental understanding of this dynamic, fast-moving field, Principles of Neuroscience stands alone as the most authoritative and indispensible resource of its kind.In this classic text, prominent researchers in the field expertly survey the entire spectrum of neural science, giving an up-to-date, unparalleled view of the discipline for anyone who studies brain and mind. Here, in one remarkable volume, is the current state of neural science knowledge―ranging from molecules and cells, to anatomic structures and systems, to the senses and cognitive functions―all supported by more than 900 precise, full-color illustrations. In addition to clarifying complex topics, the book also benefits from a cohesive organization, beginning with an insightful overview of the interrelationships between the brain, nervous system, genes, and behavior. Principles of Neural Science then proceeds with an in-depth examination of the molecular and cellular biology of nerve cells, synaptic transmission, and the neural basis of cognition. The remaining sections illuminate how cells, molecules, and systems give us sight, hearing, touch, movement, thought, learning, memories, and emotions.The new fifth edition of Principles of Neural Science is thoroughly updated to reflect the tremendous amount of research, and the very latest clinical perspectives, that have significantly transformed the field within the last decade.Ultimately, Principles of Neural Science affirms that all behavior is an expression of neural activity, and that the future of clinical neurology and psychiatry hinges on the progress of neural science. Far exceeding the scope and scholarship of similar texts, this unmatched guide offers a commanding, scientifically rigorous perspective on the molecular mechanisms of neural function and disease―one that you’ll continually rely on to advance your comprehension of brain, mind, and behavior.FEATURESThe cornerstone reference in the field of neuroscience that explains how the nerves, brain, and mind functionClear emphasis on how behavior can be examined through the electrical activity of both individual neurons and systems of nerve cellsCurrent focus on molecular biology as a tool for probing the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases, including muscular dystrophy, Huntington disease, and certain forms of Alzheimer’s diseaseMore than 900 engaging full-color illustrations―including line drawings, radiographs, micrographs, and medical photographs clarify often-complex neuroscience conceptsOutstanding section on the development and emergence of behavior, including important coverage of`,edition: `5`,isbn: `9780071390118`,location: `New York`,pagetotal: `1760`,publisher: `McGraw-Hill Education / Medical`,title: `Principles of Neural Science`,year: `2012`,tags: `tesse`},

We show that the polynomial coefficients in the Legendre expansion, and thus, the whole series, converge to zero much more rapidly compared to those in the Taylor expansion of the same order. Furthermore, using numerical analysis with a sixth-order polynomial expansion, we demonstrate that the Legendre polynomial approximation yields an error at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of the analogous Taylor series approximation.

Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm, when compared with several existing closed-form time-domain estimators, is closer to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).

Wainwright`,abstract: `We analyze a class of estimators based on convex relaxation for solving high-dimensional matrix decomposition problems. The observations are noisy realizations of a linear transformation X of the sum of an (approximately) low rank matrix with a second matrix endowed with a complementary form of low-dimensional structure; this set-up includes many statistical models of interest, including factor analysis, multi-task regression and robust covariance estimation. We derive a general theorem that bounds the Frobenius norm error for an estimate of the pair obtained by solving a convex optimization problem that combines the nuclear norm with a general decomposable regularizer. Our results use a "spikiness" condition that is related to, but milder than, singular vector incoherence. We specialize our general result to two cases that have been studied in past work: low rank plus an entrywise sparse matrix, and low rank plus a columnwise sparse matrix. For both models, our theory yields nonasymptotic Frobenius error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic noise matrices, and applies to matrices that can be exactly or approximately low rank, and matrices that can be exactly or approximately sparse. Moreover, for the case of stochastic noise matrices and the identity observation operator, we establish matching lower bounds on the minimax error. The sharpness of our nonasymptotic predictions is confirmed by numerical simulations. /textcopyrightInstitute of Mathematical Statistics, 2012.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1102.4807`,doi: `10.1214/12-AOS1000`,eprint: `1102.4807`,isbn: `15324435`,issn: `00905364`,journal: `Annals of Statistics`,keywords: `Composite regularizers,High-dimensional inference,Nuclear norm,seminal`,number: `2`,pages: `1171--1197`,title: `Noisy matrix decomposition via convex relaxation: Optimal rates in high dimensions`,volume: `40`,year: `2012`,tags: `seminal,#merged`},

  {key: `2011_tzeng_etal1`,type: `book`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,author: `Gwo Hshiung Tzeng and Jih Jeng Huang`,abstract: `Decision makers are often faced with several conflicting alternatives. How do they evaluate trade-offs when there are more than three criteria? To help people make optimal decisions, scholars in the discipline of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) continue to develop new methods for structuring preferences and determining the correct relative weights for criteria. A compilation of modern decision-making techniques, Multiple Attribute Decision Making: Methods and Applications focuses on the fuzzy set approach to multiple attribute decision making (MADM). Drawing on their experience, the authors bring together current methods and real-life applications of MADM techniques for decision analysis. They also propose a novel hybrid MADM model that combines DEMATEL and analytic network process (ANP) with VIKOR procedures. The first part of the book focuses on the theory of each method and includes examples that can be calculated without a computer, providing a complete understanding of the procedures. Methods include the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), ANP, simple additive weighting method, ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, the gray relational model, fuzzy integral technique, rough sets, and the structural model. Integrating theory and practice, the second part of the book illustrates how methods can be used to solve real-world MADM problems.

Turner and Maneesh Sahani`,editor: ` `,abstract: `Demodulation is an ill-posed problem whenever both carrier and envelope signals are broadband and unknown. Here, we approach this problem using the methods of probabilistic inference. The new approach, called Probabilistic Amplitude Demodulation (PAD), is computationally challenging but improves on existing methods in a number of ways. By contrast to previous approaches to demodulation, it satisfies five key desiderata: PAD has soft constraints because it is probabilistic; PAD is able to automatically adjust to the signal because it learns parameters; PAD is user-steerable because the solution can be shaped by user-specific prior information; PAD is robust to broad-band noise because this is modeled explicitly; and PAD's solution is self-consistent, empirically satisfying a Carrier Identity property. Furthermore, the probabilistic view naturally encompasses noise and uncertainty, allowing PAD to cope with missing data and return error bars on carrier and envelope estimates. Finally, we show that when PAD is applied to a bandpass-filtered signal, the stop-band energy of the inferred carrier is minimal, making PAD well-suited to sub-band demodulation. /textcopyright 2006 IEEE.`,doi: `10.1109/TASL.2011.2135852`,issn: `15587916`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing`,keywords: `Carrier,demodulation,envelope,inference,learning`,number: `8`,pages: `2398--2411`,title: `Demodulation as probabilistic inference`,volume: `19`,year: `2011`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/envelope/2011 Demodulation as Probabilistic Inference - Turner and Sahani.pdf`,tags: `#merged,envelope`},
  {key: `2011_stein_etal`,type: `book`,author: `Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `This first volume, a three-part introduction to the subject, is intended for students with a beginning knowledge of mathematical analysis who are motivated to discover the ideas that shape Fourier analysis. It begins with the simple conviction that Fourier arrived at in the early nineteenth century when studying problems in the physical sciences--that an arbitrary function can be written as an infinite sum of the most basic trigonometric functions. The first part implements this idea in terms of notions of convergence and summability of Fourier series, while highlighting applications such as the isoperimetric inequality and equidistribution. The second part deals with the Fourier transform and its applications to classical partial differential equations and the Radon transform; a clear introduction to the subject serves to avoid technical difficulties. The book closes with Fourier theory for finite abelian groups, which is applied to prime numbers in arithmetic progression. In organizing their exposition, the authors have carefully balanced an emphasis on key conceptual insights against the need to provide the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis. Students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences will find the theory and applications covered in this volume to be of real interest. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which Fourier Analysis is the first, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.`,isbn: `9781400831234`,journal: `Fourier Analysis: An Introduction`,pages: `1--309`,title: `Fourier analysis: An introduction`,year: `2011`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Harmonic Analysis/2003 Fourier Analysis - Stein, Elias M. and Shakarchi, Rami.pdf`},

The NNs were found to predict the Nash equilibrium approximately 70% of the time in new games. Similarly to humans, the neural network agents are also found to suffer from subgame and truncation inconsistency, supporting the contention that they are appropriate models of general learning in humans. The agents were found to behave in a bounded rational manner as a result of the endogenous emergence of decision heuristics. In particular a very simple heuristic socialmax, that chooses the cell with the highest social payoff explains their behavior approximately 60% of the time, whereas the ownmax heuristic that simply chooses the cell with the maximum payoff for that agent fares worse explaining behavior roughly 38%, albeit still significantly better than chance. These two heuristics were found to be ecologically valid for the backward induction problem as they predicted the Nash equilibrium in 67% and 50% of the games respectively. Compared to various standard classification algorithms, the NNs were found to be only slightly more accurate than standard discriminant analyses. However, the latter do not model the dynamic learning process and have an ad hoc postulated functional form. In contrast, a NN agent's behavior evolves with experience and is capable of taking on any functional form according to the universal approximation theorem.`,doi: `10.2139/ssrn.812044`,issn: `1556-5068`,journal: `SSRN Electronic Journal`,pages: `10`,title: `Learning Backward Induction: A Neural Network Agent Approach`,year: `2011`},

If you need more help than I offer here, you may need to learn a few modelling basics. This is a topic in itself and way too comprehensive to cover here. I will eventually write up a walkthrough of creating an MDL from beginning to end. Feel free to email me if you have some specific questions. I use Lightwave 3D v5 for modelling and animating models for quake. All of the models in X-MEN Quake are created specifically and individually for each character. I use bones to animate the meshes. I will be describing some methods for doing things here that I have found to be the best. These methods are for Lightwave 3d, Util3D, and QuakeMe, and not necessarily useful for other modellers or editors. When first creating your model, keep an eye on the polygon count. As you will be creating the model with quads, double the count for the total number. Apparently if your models are over 500 poly's they slow the game considerably, so keep them simple. The player model is 408 poly's (including weapons) and my models for X-MEN Quake are all between 400 and 500 poly's. This seems to be a good number, allowing for enough detail while not slowing the game. Remember to triangulate your model once it is finished. I originally created my models to the scale of the player mesh that I had extracted but didn't take into account the scale factor in the modelgen script, resulting in them being way too big. But then when I scaled them down, the texture that was created was too small. I finally created the base frame to the scale of the player mesh, which gave me a good texture size, and scaled the animation frames to 0.4 of the base, which made the MDL the right scale for the game. So make sure that if you extract a frame from an existing MDL for size reference, that you set the scale in the modelgen script to "1". When animating, preview at 10 frames per second.

This model arises in resource allocation problems that permit or require sequential allocation decisions in a probabilistic setting. One particular application is in obsolescence inventory management. In this paper, the adaptive SKP is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem for discrete random rewards. The paper also presents a heuristic that mixes adaptive and static policies to overcome the "curse of dimensionality" in the DP. The proposed heuristic is extended to problems with normally distributed random rewards. The heuristic can solve large problems quickly, and its solution always outperforms a static policy. The numerical study indicates that a near-optimal solution can be obtained by using an algorithm with limited look-ahead capabilities. /textcopyright2011 INFORMS.`,doi: `10.1287/opre.1100.0857`,issn: `0030364X`,journal: `Operations Research`,keywords: `Dynamic programming,Sequential decision analysis`,number: `1`,pages: `242--248`,title: `The adaptive knapsack problem with stochastic rewards`,url: `http://users.iems.northwestern.edu//textasciitilde`,volume: `59`,year: `2011`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2011IlhanAdaptive The Adaptive Knapsack Problem with Stochastic Rewards.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

  {key: `2011_greene`,type: `article`,author: `William H Greene`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `OBJECTIVE This study examines the role of community-based health insurance (CBHI) in influencing health-seeking behaviour in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Community-based health insurance was introduced in Nouna district, Burkina Faso, in 2004 with the goal to improve access to contracted providers based at primary- and secondary-level facilities. The paper specifically examines the effect of CBHI enrolment on reducing the prevalence of seeking modern and traditional methods of self-treatment as the first choice in care among the insured population. METHODS Three stages of analysis were adopted to measure this effect. First, propensity score matching was used to minimize the observed baseline differences between the insured and uninsured populations. Second, through matching the average treatment effect on the treated, the effect of insurance enrolment on health-seeking behaviour was estimated. Finally, multinomial logistic regression was applied to model demand for available health care options, including no treatment, traditional self-treatment, modern self-treatment, traditional healers and facility-based care. RESULTS For the first choice in care sought, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of self-treatment among the insured and uninsured populations, reaching over 55% for each group. When comparing the alternative option of no treatment, CBHI played no significant role in reducing the demand for self-care (either traditional or modern) or utilization of traditional healers, while it did significantly increase consumption of facility-based care. The average treatment effect on the treated was insignificant for traditional self-care, modern self-care and traditional healer, but was significant with a positive effect for use of facility care. Discussion While CBHI does have a positive impact on facility care utilization, its effect on reducing the prevalence of self-care is limited. The policy recommendations for improving the CBHI scheme's responsiveness to population health care demand should incorporate community-based initiatives that offer attractive and appropriate alternatives to self-care.`,isbn: `0262650401`,journal: `Ariel`,number: `3`,pages: `108`,title: `Solution Manual for`,url: `http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21414993`,volume: `32`,year: `2011`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Physics/2013 Fundamentals of Physics Solution Mantual - Halliday & Resnick.pdf`},

Over past fifteen years, a view has emerged that computing based on models inspired by our understanding of the structure and function of the biological neural networks may hold the key to the success of solving intelligent tasks by machines like noisy time series prediction and more[1]. A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor that has a natural propensity for storing experiential knowledge and making it available for use. It resembles the brain in two respects: Knowledge is acquired by the network through a learning process and interneuron connection strengths known as synaptic weights are used to store the knowledge[2]. Moreover, recently the Markets have become a more accessible investment tool, not only for strategic investors but for common people as well. Consequently they are not only related to macroeconomic parameters, but they influence everyday life in a more direct way. Therefore they constitute a mechanism which has important and direct social impacts. The characteristic that all Stock Markets have in common is the uncertainty, which is related with their short and long-term future state. This feature is undesirable for the investor but it is also unavoidable whenever the Stock Market is selected as the investment tool. The best that one can do is to try to reduce this uncertainty. Stock Market Prediction (or Forecasting) is one of the instruments in this process. We cannot exactly predict what will happen tomorrow, but from previous experiences we can roughly predict tomorrow. In this paper this knowledge based approach is taken. The accuracy of the predictive system which is made by ANN can be tuned with help of different network architectures. Network is consists of input layer ,hidden layer & output layer of neuron, no of neurons per layer can be configured according to the needed result accuracy & throughput,there is no cut & bound rule for that.the network can be trained by using sample training data set,this neural network model is very much useful for mapping unknown functional dependencies between different input & output tuples.In this paper two types of neural network architecture,feed forward multilayer network & timedelay recurrent network is used for the prediction of the NASDAQ stock price.A comparative error study for both network architecture is introduced in this paper.`,keywords: `Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computi`,pages: `7`,title: `Comparative study of Financial Time Series Prediction by Artificial Neural Network with Gradient Descent Learning`,year: `2011`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Comparative study of Financial Time Series Prediction By Artificial Neural Network with Gradient Descent Learning - Ghosh.PDF`},

  {reviewed: true,key: `2011_erocal`,type: `thesis`,author: `Burçin Eröcal`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `The main result of this thesis is an eﬀective method to extend Karr’s symbolic summation framework to algebraic extensions. These arise, for example, when working with expressions involving (−1)n. An implementation of this method, including a modernised version of Karr’s algorithm is also presented. Karr’s algorithm is the summation analogue of the Risch algorithm for indeﬁnite integration. In the summation case, towers of specialized diﬀerence ﬁelds called ΠΣ-ﬁelds are used to model nested sums and products. This is similar to the way elementary functions involving nested logarithms and exponentials are represented in diﬀerential ﬁelds in the integration case. In contrast to the integration framework, only transcendental extensions are allowed in Karr’s construction. Algebraic extensions of ΠΣ-ﬁelds can even be rings with zero divisors. Karr’s methods rely heavily on the ability to solve ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerence equations and they are no longer applicable over these rings. Based on Bronstein’s formulation of a method used by Singer for the solution of diﬀerential equations over algebraic extensions, we transform a ﬁrst-order linear equation over an algebraic extension to a system of ﬁrst-order equations over a purely transcendental extension ﬁeld. However, this domain is not necessarily a ΠΣ-ﬁeld. Using a structure theorem by Singer and van der Put, we reduce this system to a single ﬁrst-order equation over a ΠΣ-ﬁeld, which can be solved by Karr’s algorithm. We also describe how to construct towers of diﬀerence ring extensions on an algebraic extension, where the same reduction methods can be used. A common bottleneck for symbolic summation algorithms is the computation of nullspaces of matrices over rational function ﬁelds. We present a fast algorithm for matrices over Q(x) which uses fast arithmetic at the hardware level with calls to BLAS subroutines after modular reduction.

This flow is computed by solving a sequence of electrical flow problems. Each electrical flow is given by the solution of a system of linear equations in a Laplacian matrix, and thus may be approximately computed in nearly-linear time. Using this approach, we develop the fastest known algorithm for computing approximately maximum s-t flows. For a graph having n vertices and m edges, our algorithm computes a (1-∈)-approximately maximum s-t flow in time ∼O(mn1/3∈-11/3). A dual version of our approach gives the fastest known algorithm for computing a (1+∈)-approximately minimum s-t cut. It takes ∼O(m+n 4/3∈-16/3) time. Previously, the best dependence on m and n was achieved by the algorithm of Goldberg and Rao (J.

The most accurate and robust fit is obtained by minimizing geometric (orthogonal) distances, but this problem has no closed form solution and most known algorithms are prohibitively slow. We revisit this issue based on recent advances by S. J. Ahn, D. Eberly, and our own. Ahn has sorted out various approaches and identified the most efficient one. Eberly has developed a fast method of projecting points onto ellipses/ellipsoids (and gave a proof of its convergence). We extend Eberly's projection algorithm to other conics, as well as quadrics in space. We also demonstrate that Eberly's projection method combined with Ahn's most efficient approach (and using Taubin's algebraic fit for initialization) makes a highly efficient fitting scheme working well for all quadratic curves and surfaces. /textcopyright 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Inmany applications selective spectral imaging is sought since relevantinformation often lies within a subset of spectral bands. Capturing andreconstructing all the spectral bands in the observed image cube, tothen throw away a large portion of this data, is inefficient. To thisend, this paper extends the concept of CASSI to a system admittingmultiple shot measurements, which leads not only to higher quality ofreconstruction but also to spectrally selective imaging when thesequence of code aperture patterns is optimized. The aperture codeoptimization problem is shown to be analogous to the optimization of aconstrained multichannel filter bank. The optimal code apertures allowthe decomposition of the CASSI measurement into several subsets, eachhaving information from only a few selected spectral bands. The richtheory of compressive sensing is used to effectively reconstruct thespectral bands of interest from the measurements. A number ofsimulations are developed to illustrate the spectral imagingcharacteristics attained by optimal aperture codes.

With Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, Seven Languages hits what's essential and unique about each language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages. For each language, you'll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the language's most important features. As the book proceeds, you'll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quickly--for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them. Among this group of seven, you'll explore the most critical programming models of our time. Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system that's at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure. Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use Erlang's let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala. Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems. It's all here, all in one place. Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.`,isbn: `9781934356593`,journal: `University of Anbar for pure science`,keywords: `epoxy,glass fibers,hardness,water absorption`,number: `3`,pages: `300`,title: `Effect of Water Absorption on Hardness Property for Epoxy Reinforced by Glass Fibers`,volume: `5`,year: `2011`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Programming/2010 Seven Languages in Seven Weeks - Tate.pdf`},

Based on this modeling, four different prospective scenarios were comparatively analyzed in order to propose strategic actions to promote the sustainability and competitiveness of the chain. The results were then presented to two different groups of external specialists in order to validate the conclusions drawn and the proposals. Both groups agreed with the ideas presented. The paper is constructed as follows: a brief introduction focusing on contextual elements of the biodiesel production in Brazil and in Rio Grande do Sul; some background material regarding agroindustrial production chains and an overview of the biodiesel production chain of interest; a description of the method used to perform the research; main results and discussion; and conclusions.

Such information has allowed the creation and formal recognition of the closely related genera Gordonia , Tsukamurella and Dietzia to include isolates once placed unconvincingly in the genus Rhodococcus , and the re-assignment of former members of Nocardia and Tsukamurella to it. However, several taxonomic difficulties remain. Where to place Rhodococcus equi is still problematic, and many Rhodococcus isolates, some probably representing new species, have never been formally described.

  {key: `2010_stein_etal`,type: `book`,editor: ` `,author: `Elias M Stein and Rami Shakarchi`,translator: ` `,abstract: `With this second volume, we enter the intriguing world of complex analysis. From the first theorems on, the elegance and sweep of the results is evident. The starting point is the simple idea of extending a function initially given for real values of the argument to one that is defined when the argument is complex. From there, one proceeds to the main properties of holomorphic functions, whose proofs are generally short and quite illuminating: the Cauchy theorems, residues, analytic continuation, the argument principle. With this background, the reader is ready to learn a wealth of additional material connecting the subject with other areas of mathematics: the Fourier transform treated by contour integration, the zeta function and the prime number theorem, and an introduction to elliptic functions culminating in their application to combinatorics and number theory. Thoroughly developing a subject with many ramifications, while striking a careful balance between conceptual insights and the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis, Complex Analysis will be welcomed by students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which Complex Analysis is the second, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.`,doi: `10.2307/j.ctv1b9f4xt.10`,isbn: `9781400831159`,issn: `00255572`,journal: `Complex Analysis`,number: `2`,pages: `1--379`,publisher: `Princeton University Press`,series: `Princeton lectures in analysis`,title: `Complex analysis`,year: `2010`,tags: `#merged`},

It is fundamental to the fields of civil, mechanical, chemical and bioengineering. This time-tested text has been used for over 35 years to introduce junior and senior-level undergraduate engineering students, as well as graduate students, to the basic principles of continuum mechanics and their applications to real engineering problems. The text begins with a detailed presentation of the coordinate invariant quantity, the tensor, introduced as a linear transformation. This is then followed by the formulation of the kinematics of deformation, large as well as very small, the description of stresses and the basic laws of continuum mechanics. As applications of these laws, the behaviors of certain material idealizations (models) including the elastic, viscous and viscoelastic materials, are presented.This new edition offers expanded coverage of the subject matter both in terms of details and contents, providing greater flexibility for either a one or two-semester course in either continuum mechanics or elasticity. Although this current edition has expanded the coverage of the subject matter, it nevertheless uses the same approach as that in the earlier editions - that one can cover advanced topics in an elementary way that go from simple to complex, using a wealth of illustrative examples and problems. It is, and will remain, one of the most accessible textbooks on this challenging engineering subject.

It is a fundamental component of Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems. The authors focus on shape interrogation of geometric models bounded by free-form surfaces. Free-form surfaces, also called sculptured surfaces, are widely used in the bodies of ships, automobiles and aircraft, which have both functionality and attractive shape requirements. Many electronic devices as well as consumer products are designed with aesthetic shapes, which involve free-form surfaces. This book provides the mathematical fundamentals as well as algorithms for various shape interrogation methods. From the reviews: "This book provides the mathematical fundamentals as well as algorithms for various shape interrogation methods including nonlinear polynomial solvers, intersection problems, differential geometry of intersection curves, distance functions, curve and surface interrogation, umbilics and lines of curvature, geodesics, and offset curves and surfaces. [... ] It may well be one of the most important books of the 2002s that has been written on shape interrogation for graduate students in mathematics, engineering, computer science, focusing on geometrical modeling and solid modeling. The book will inform and enlighten professionals in industry and therefore remains essential reading for them too. Currently there are several excellent books in the area of geometric modeling and in the area of solid modeling. The major contribution of this book lies in its skilful manner of providing a bridge between these two areas that is guaranteed to make the target audience cry out aloud with delight." Current Engineering Practice 2002-2003, Vol. 45, Issue 3-4 "This book gives a detailed description of algorithms and computational methods for shape interrogation [... ] The book can be used in a course for advanced graduate students and also as a reference text for researchers and practitioners in CAD/CAM. [... ] is a very detailed and complete book on topics that are important in both the theory and the practice of geometric modeling." L. Henrique de Figueiredo, Mathematical Reviews 2003 a "... This book by Patrikalakis and Maekawa is the first thorough, long overdue, look at this crucial area. [... ] It will serve well any researcher, either in academia or industry, working in the area of freeform design or manufacturing. This work continues from the point where the traditional geometric design and solid modeling books stop. ... Shape interrogation and computational geometry of freeform shapes have been a part of the geometric design and manufacturing community for a long time. This book makes efforts and is likely to become the 'Bible' for this area.

Weconsider the integrated optimization of logistics and production costsassociated with the supply chain members. These problems routinely occurin a wide variety of industries including semiconductor manufacturing,multi-tier automotive supply chains, and consumer appliances to name afew. There are two types of decision variables: binary variables forselection of companies to form the supply chain and continuous variablesassociated with production planning. A scenario approach is used tohandle the uncertainty of demand. The formulation is a robustoptimization model with three components in the objective function:expected total costs, cost variability due to demand uncertainty, andexpected penalty for demand unmet at the end of the planning horizon.The increase of computational time with the numbers of echelons andmembers per echelon necessitates a heuristic. A heuristic based on ak-shortest path algorithm is developed by using a surrogate distance todenote the effectiveness of each member in the supply chain. Theheuristic can find an optimal solution very quickly in some small- andmedium-size cases. For large problems, a good'' solution with asmall gap relative to our lower bound is obtained in a shortcomputational time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  {key: `2010_oertel`,type: `article`,author: `Herbert Oertel`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `In contrast to the topics discussed in previous chapters, biofluid mechanics is concerned with flows that are influenced by flexible biological surfaces. We distinguish between flows past living bodies in air or in water, such as bird flight or the swimming of fish, and internal flows, such as the closed blood circulation of living beings. In the previous millions of years, evolution has developed crawling, running, swimming, gliding, and flying as methods of motion of living beings, depending on their size and weight. The necessary propulsion for altering position requires flow control adapted to the Reynolds number of the motion. The motion of bacteria and amoebae takes place at very small Reynolds numbers, where friction dominates, with cilia and flagella. Tadpoles and octopuses use the inertia of jet propulsion for motion. Eels move in a wavelike manner; whales use vortex separation at the tail fin for motion at Reynolds numbers of up to 108. Fast-swimming fish such as the shark have longitudinal grooves on their scales that affect the viscous sublayer of the flow boundary layer so that the flow drag is reduced. Heat and mass transport in living beings takes place in circulatory systems. These include respiration, the circulatory system of the blood, and the lymph, as well as that of water. All biological flows have in common that the motion is affected by external or internal highly flexible and structured surfaces. This leads to an actively controlled flow whose losses are kept small. Of the many different biological flows, in this chapter we will treat the flying of birds, the swimming of fishes as well as looking at the blood circulation of the human body in depth.`,doi: `10.1007/978-1-4419-1564-1_12`,issn: `2196968X`,journal: `Applied Mathematical Sciences (Switzerland)`,keywords: `Aortic Valve,Left Ventricle,Mitral Valve,Reynolds Number,Shear Rate`,pages: `685--752`,pmid: `9611395`,title: `Biofluid Mechanics`,volume: `158`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Fluid Mechanics/1998 Fluid Mechanics - Frank M.

Musicians, engineers, and producers laughed and cried at the crazy goings-on they'd never imagined or recognized all too well. Now Mixerman turns his razor-sharp gaze to the art of mixing and gives followers and the uninitiated reason to hope if not for logic and civility in the recording studio then at least for a good sounding record. With a firm commitment to art over technology and to maintaining a grasp of each, Mixerman outlines his own approach to recording success, based on his years mixing records in all genres of music for all kinds of artists, often under trying circumstances. As he states in his introduction to the new volume, "Even if you're not a professional mixer, even if you're a musician trying to mix your own work or a studio owner in a smaller market, you have your own set of pressures to deal with while you're mixing. Regardless of what those pressures are, it's important to identify and recognize them, if for no other reason than so you can learn to completely ignore them." But how?

A novel curvature estimation algorithm based on performing line integrals over an adaptive data window is proposed. The use of line integrals makes the proposed approach inherently robust to noise. Furthermore, the accuracy of curvature estimation is significantly improved by using wild bootstrapping to adaptively adjusting the data window for line integral. Compared to existing approaches, this new method promises enhanced performance, in terms of both robustness and accuracy, as well as low computation cost. A number of numerical examples using synthetic noisy and noiseless data clearly demonstrated the advantages of this proposed method over state-of-the-art curvature estimation algorithms.

However,the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive,lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support theprinciples and practices of agile development. Little research hasempirically examined the software development agility construct in termsof its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software developmentperformance. As a result, there is a lack of understanding about howorganizations can effectively implement an agile development approach.Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative andqualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agiledevelopment by empirically examining the relationships among twodimensions of software development agility (software team responseextensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedentsthat can be con trolled (team autonomy and team diversity), and threeaspects of software development performance (on-time completion,on-budget completion, and software functionality). Our PLS results ofsurvey, responses of 399 software project managers suggest that therelationships among these variables are more complex than what has beenperceived by the literature. The results suggest a tradeoff relationshipbetween response extensiveness and response efficiency. These twoagility dimensions impact software development performance differently:response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion,on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas responseextensiveness positively affects only software functionality. Theresults also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect onresponse efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, andthat team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness, Weconducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate ourPLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex,dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, andperformance. The qualitative analysis also provides explanations forboth supported and unsupported hypotheses.

Key concepts and applications are addressed in a thought-provoking manner and are implemented using vector, matrix, and linear algebra methods. With a balanced focus on mathematical theory and computational techniques, this self-contained book equips readers with the essential knowledge needed to transition smoothly from mathematical models to practical digital data applications. The book first establishes a complete vector space and matrix framework for analyzing signals and images. Classical methods such as the discrete Fourier transform, the discrete cosine transform, and their application to JPEG compression are outlined followed by coverage of the Fourier series and the general theory of inner product spaces and orthogonal bases. The book then addresses convolution, filtering, and windowing techniques for signals and images. Finally, modern approaches are introduced, including wavelets and the theory of filter banks as a means of understanding the multiscale localized analysis underlying the JPEG 2000 compression standard. Throughout the book, examples using image compression demonstrate how mathematical theory translates into application. Additional applications such as progressive transmission of images, image denoising, spectrographic analysis, and edge detection are discussed. Each chapter provides a series of exercises as well as a MATLAB project that allows readers to apply mathematical concepts to solving real problems. Additional MATLAB routines are available via the book's related Web site. With its insightful treatment of the underlying mathematics in image compression and signal processing, Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets is an ideal book for mathematics, engineering, and computer science courses at the upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for mathematicians, engineers, and other practitioners who would like to learn more about the relevance of mathematics in digital data processing.`,doi: `10.1080/02664760902919762`,isbn: `9781119258230`,issn: `0266-4763`,journal: `Journal of Applied Statistics`,number: `10`,pages: `1783--1784`,title: `Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets`,volume: `37`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Harmonic Analysis/Fourier Transform/2018 discrete fourier analysis and wavelets - applications to signal and image - broughton et al.pdf`},

The versatility of PHAs has made them good candidates for the study of their potential in a variety of areas from biomedical/medical fields to food, packaging, textile and household material. While production costs are still a drawback to wider usage of these biopolymers, their application as low volume high cost items is becoming a reality. The future trend is to focus on the development of more efficient and economical processes for PHA production, isolation, purification and improvement of PHA material properties. /textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Burdette and Satoru Hayasaka`,editor: ` `,abstract: `Recent developments in network theory have allowed for the study of the structure and function of the human brain in terms of a network of interconnected components. Among the many nodes that form a network, some play a crucial role and are said to be central within the network structure. Central nodes may be identified via centrality metrics, with degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality being three of the most popular measures. Degree identifies the most connected nodes, whereas betweenness centrality identifies those located on the most traveled paths. Eigenvector centrality considers nodes connected to other high degree nodes as highly central. In the work presented here, we propose a new centrality metric called leverage centrality that considers the extent of connectivity of a node relative to the connectivity of its neighbors. The leverage centrality of a node in a network is determined by the extent to which its immediate neighbors rely on that node for information. Although similar in concept, there are essential differences between eigenvector and leverage centrality that are discussed in this manuscript. Degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and leverage centrality were compared using functional brain networks generated from healthy volunteers. Functional cartography was also used to identify neighborhood hubs (nodes with high degree within a network neighborhood). Provincial hubs provide structure within the local community, and connector hubs mediate connections between multiple communities. Leverage proved to yield information that was not captured by degree, betweenness, or eigenvector centrality and was more accurate at identifying neighborhood hubs. We propose that this metric may be able to identify critical nodes that are highly influential within the network. /textcopyright 2010 Joyce et al.`,doi: `10.1371/journal.pone.0012200`,issn: `19326203`,journal: `PLoS ONE`,number: `8`,pmid: `20808943`,title: `A new measure of centrality for brain networks`,volume: `5`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/graph theory and neural networks/2019 A New Measure of Centrality for Brain Networks.PDF`},

  {key: `2010_hsu_etal`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Han Wen Hsu and Chi Min Liu`,abstract: `The theory of autoregressive (AR) modeling, also known as linear prediction, has been established by the Fourier analysis of infinite discrete-time sequences or continuous-time signals. Nevertheless, for various finite-length discrete trigonometric transforms (DTTs), including the discrete cosine and sine transforms of different types, the theory is not well established. Several DTTs have been used in current audio coding, and the AR modeling method can be applied to reduce coding artifacts or exploit data redundancies. This paper systematically develops the AR modeling fundamentals of temporal and spectral envelopes for the sixteen members of the DTTs. This paper first considers the AR modeling in the generalized discrete Fourier transforms (GDFTs). Then, we derive the modeling to all the DTTs by introducing the analytic transforms which convert the real-valued vectors into complex-valued ones. Through the process, we build the compact matrix representations for the AR modeling of the DTTs in both time domain and DTT domain. These compact forms also illustrate that the AR modeling for the envelopes can be performed through the Hilbert envelope and the power envelope. These compact forms can be used to develop new coding technologies or examine the possible defects in the existing AR modeling methods for DTTs, We apply the forms to analyze the current temporal noise shaping (TNS) tool in MPEG-2/4 advanced audio coding (AAC). /textcopyright 2010 IEEE.`,doi: `10.1109/TSP.2010.2047105`,issn: `1053587X`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing`,keywords: `Autoregressive (AR) modeling,Discrete cosine transform (DCT),Discrete trigonometric transform (DTT),Frequency-domain linear prediction,Generalized discrete Fourier transform (GDFT),Hilbert envelope,Linear prediction,Linear prediction in spectral domain,Temporal noise shaping (TNS)`,number: `7`,pages: `3692--3705`,title: `Autoregressive modeling of temporal/spectral envelopes with finite-length discrete trigonometric transforms`,volume: `58`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/envelope/2010 Autoregressive Modeling of TemporalSpectral Envelopes With Finite-Length Discrete Trigonometric Transforms - Hsu and Liu.pdf`},

Only by labeling perceived objects with semantics, a robot can reason about its environment, execute high-level plans and interact autonomously with it. A robot can perceive its enviroment by using 3D LIDAR systems, which generate 3D point cloud images of the environment. This data is perceived in a spatial domain, i.e. the raw data gives only positions of the measured points. The transfer from the spatial domain to the semantic domain is known as the gap problem in AI and one of the hardest to solve. In this paper we present an approach on how to extract spatial entities from unorganized point cloud data generated by a tilting laser scanner. Additionally, we describe how the extracted spatial entities can be mapped to entities in the semantic domain using feature descriptors. We also discuss, how a-priori knowledge about typical indoor environments can be used for semantic labeling.`,journal: `/ldots International Conference on /ldots`,keywords: `own`,number: `November 2014`,title: `Semantic labeling: Classification of 3d entities based on spatial feature descriptors`,url: `http://www.best-of-robotics.org/pages/BRICS-events/icra2010/SemanticLabeling2010Eich.pdf`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/Semantic Labeling - Classiﬁcation of 3D Entities Based on Spatial Feature - Eich et al.pdf`},

The adaptation, in essence, allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive yet rarely observed features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies the task of setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments on a text classification task, showing substantial improvements for classification with sparse datasets.`,isbn: `9780982252925`,journal: `COLT 2010 - The 23rd Conference on Learning Theory`,pages: `257--269`,title: `Adaptive subgradient methods for online learning and stochastic optimization`,volume: `12`,year: `2010`},

It is an attempt to build machine that will mimic brain activities and be able to learn. NN usually learns by examples. If NN is supplied with enough examples, it should be able to perform classification and even discover new trends or patterns in data. Basic NN is composed of three layers, input, output and hidden layer. Each layer can have number of nodes and nodes from input layer are connected to the nodes from hidden layer. Nodes from hidden layer are connected to the nodes from output layer. Those connections represent weights between nodes. This paper describes one of most popular NN algorithms, Back Propagation (BP) Algorithm. The aim is to show the logic behind this algorithm. Idea behind BP algorithm is quite simple, output of NN is evaluated against desired output. If results are not satisfactory, connection (weights) between layers are modified and process is repeated again and again until error is small enough. Simple BP example is demonstrated in this paper with NN architecture also covered. New implementation of BP algorithm are emerging and there are few parameters that could be changed to improve performance of BP.`,journal: `Fett.Tu-Sofia.Bg`,keywords: `artificial neural networks,back propagation algorithm,neural networks`,number: `July`,pages: `3--7`,title: `Neural Networks and Back Propagation Algorithm`,url: `http://fett.tu-sofia.bg/et/2006/ET2006`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/CilimkovicNeural Neural Networks and Back Propagation Algorithm.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Gel`,abstract: `Tracking of an unknown frequency embedded in noise is widely applied in a variety of applications. Unknown frequencies can be obtained by approximating generalized spectral density of a periodic process by an autoregressive (AR) model. The advantage is that an AR model has a simple structure and its parameters can be easily estimated iteratively, which is crucial for online (real-time) applications. Typically, the order of the AR approximation is chosen by information criteria. However, with an increase of a sample size, model order may change, which leads to re-estimation of all model parameters. We propose a new iterative procedure for frequency detection based on a regularization of an empirical information matrix. The suggested method enables to avoid the repeated model selection as well as parameter estimation steps and therefore optimize computational costs. The asymptotic properties of the proposed regularized AR (RAR) frequency estimates are derived and performance of RAR is evaluated by numerical examples. /textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.`,doi: `10.1016/j.jmva.2010.02.006`,issn: `0047259X`,journal: `Journal of Multivariate Analysis`,keywords: `Autoregressive approximation,Frequency detection,Regularization,Robust trimming algorithm,Sinusoidal signals`,number: `7`,pages: `1712--1727`,title: `Autoregressive frequency detection using Regularized Least Squares`,volume: `101`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/2010 Autoregressive frequency detection using Regularized Least Squares - Chen and Gel.pdf`},

Recent technologies are directed towards the development of bio-green materials that exert negligible side- effects on the environment. A biologically-synthesized plastic, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), has been attracting major interests due to its similar physical properties to synthetic plastics. Unlike synthetic plastics, PHA is produced from renewable resources and is degraded aerobically by microorganisms to CO2 and H2O upon disposal. The selections of suitable bacterial strains, inexpensive carbon sources, efficient fermentation and recovery processes are important aspects that should be taken into consideration for the commercialization of PHA.

The cost of large-scale production of these polymers has inhibited its widespread use. Thus, economical, large-scale production of PHAs is currently being studied intensively. Various bacterial strains, either wild-type or recombinant have been utilized with a wide spectrum of utilizable carbon sources. New fermentation strategies have been developed for the efficient production of PHAs at high concentration and productivity. With the current advances, PHAs can now be produced to a concentration of 80 g L-1 with productivities greater than 4 g PHA L-1 h-1. These advanceswill further lower the production cost of PHAs and allow this family of polymers to become a leading biodegradable polymer in the near future. This review describes the properties of PHAs, their uses, the various attempts towards the production of PHAs, focusing on the utilization of cheap substrates and the development of different fermentation strategies for the production of these polymers, an essential step forward towards their widespread use. /textcopyright2010 Society of Chemical Industry.`,doi: `10.1002/jctb.2392`,issn: `02682575`,journal: `Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology`,keywords: `Bacteria,Batch culture,Cheap carbon sources,Continuous culture,Fed-batch culture,Mixed culture,Polyhydroxyalkanoates`,number: `6`,pages: `732--743`,shorttitle: `Production of polyhydroxyalkanoates`,title: `Production of polyhydroxyalkanoates: The future green materials of choice`,volume: `85`,year: `2010`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/2010 production of polyhydroxyalkanoates - akaraonye et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Second, logistic regression is reviewed as a method for predicting the probability of a dichotomous response variable from among predictor variables. Additional approaches to categorical data analysis, such as the conditional logit, the multinomial logit, probit, and lograte models, are also discussed.

Rhythm alone had rarely been the subject of specialised study until the late nineteenth century, when several books on this topic by Rudolf Westphal were published in Leipzig. Westphal's work inspired Charles Francis Abdy Williams's 1911 book which is reissued here. Williams re-examines the classical and romantic repertoire from Handel to Tchaikovsky in the light of ancient Greek musical theory, focusing particularly on the earliest writings by Artistoxenus of Tarentum (fourth century BCE). In Williams's view, the rhythmic forms used by the Greeks are universally intelligible, and appear in all ages and cultures, unlike melodies or scales, which vary hugely. He provides insights into the microstructure of works including Bach's oratorios, Beethoven's sonatas and Schubert's songs, which will continue to intrigue musicians, classicists and mathematicians today.`,doi: `10.1017/CBO9780511703645`,isbn: `9780511703645`,journal: `The Aristoxenian Theory of Musical Rhythm`,pages: `1--191`,title: `The Aristoxenian theory of musical rhythm`,year: `2009`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Music/2009 The Aristoxenian Theory of Musical Rhythm - Williams.pdf`},

Traditional approaches suffer significantly from this shortcoming and usually make strong assumptions on the problem domain such as perfect system models, state-estimators and a Markovian hidden system. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offer a natural framework for dealing with policy learning using hidden state and require only few limiting assumptions. As they can be trained well using gradient descent, they are suited for policy gradient approaches. In this paper, we present a policy gradient method, the Recurrent Policy Gradient which constitutes a model-free reinforcement learning method. It is aimed at training limited-memory stochastic policies on problems which require long-term memories of past observations. The approach involves approximating a policy gradient for a recurrent neural network by backpropagating return-weighted characteristic eligibilities through time. Using a "Long Short-Term Memory" RNN architecture, we are able to outperform previous RL methods on three important benchmark tasks. Furthermore, we show that using history-dependent baselines helps reducing estimation variance significantly, thus enabling our approach to tackle more challenging, highly stochastic environments. /textcopyright The Author 2009.

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning.

Experimental harmonic analysis and visualization techniques, in addition to detailed damped simulations using the ﬁnite element method, were used to obtain mobility functions and operating deﬂection shapes of a top plate. The mobility functions were obtained in the following sequence. First the mobility functions were obtained on the top plate without a bridge attached. Then a bridge was glued to the top plate and new measurements were made. Finally the already attached bridge was cross-cut in situ without detaching it from the top plate, and the measurements were repeated. Those speciﬁc designs were chosen on the grounds of simplicity of construction both experimentally and in FEM simulations (no particular preference for those designs is implied). The assembly and the speciﬁc design of the bridge have shown to have considerable inﬂuence on the response of the top plate regarding the mode shapes above 300 Hz. Depending on the geometry of the bridge, its deﬂections can either be comparable to the maximum deﬂections of the top plate or can have amplitudes so small that the bridge effectively creates a nodal zone on the plate vibrations. This suggests that the shape, the stiffness, and the mass properties of the bridge may play a role in the sound quality of the instrument. /'O 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in plastic, the leaching of chemicals from plastic products and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded. /textcopyright2009 The Royal Society.`,doi: `10.1098/rstb.2009.0053`,issn: `14712970`,journal: `Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences`,keywords: `Debris,Endocrine disruption,Phthalates,Plastic,Polymer,Waste management`,number: `1526`,pages: `2153--2166`,pmid: `19528062`,shorttitle: `Plastics, the environment and human health`,title: `Plastics, the environment and human health: Current consensus and future trends`,volume: `364`,year: `2009`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/Environment/2009 plastics, the environment and human health - thompson et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

The detailed explanations of mathematical derivations and numerous illustrative examples make this textbook readily accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students taking courses in which stochastic processes play a fundamental role. The textbook is relevant to a wide variety of fields, including computer science, engineering, operations research, statistics, and mathematics.The textbook looks at the fundamentals of probability theory, from the basic concepts of set-based probability, through probability distributions, to bounds, limit theorems, and the laws of large numbers. Discrete and continuous-time Markov chains are analyzed from a theoretical and computational point of view. Topics include the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations; irreducibility; the potential, fundamental, and reachability matrices; random walk problems; reversibility; renewal processes; and the numerical computation of stationary and transient distributions. The M/M/1 queue and its extensions to more general birth-death processes are analyzed in detail, as are queues with phase-type arrival and service processes. The M/G/1 and G/M/1 queues are solved using embedded Markov chains; the busy period, residual service time, and priority scheduling are treated. Open and closed queueing networks are analyzed. The final part of the book addresses the mathematical basis of simulation.Each chapter of the textbook concludes with an extensive set of exercises.

Principally, two basic listening types can be distinguished: 'holistic' or 'synthetic' listeners recognize the sound as a whole, and appreciate its pitch and timbre as characteristic qualities of the entire sound; and 'spectral' or 'analytical' listeners break up the sound into its harmonic constituents, at the expense of timbral qualities of the sound as a whole. In-between these two extreme listening modes, intermediate listeners perceive holistic and spectral cues simultaneously to varying degrees (auditory ambiguity). Several recent neurological investigations have pinpointed these perceptual differences to neuroanatomical and neurophysiological measures of the auditory cortex. Furthermore, it has been shown that individual auditory perception bias corresponds to musical instrument preference and musical performance style. Multimodal research findings point towards an individual 'fingerprint' of auditory cortex and perception profiles; however, whether these properties are shaped by intense training or rather reflect innate, genetically determined predisposition remains a matter of unresolved debate. /textcopyright2009 Taylor & Francis.`,doi: `10.1080/07494460903404402`,issn: `07494467`,journal: `Contemporary Music Review`,keywords: `Heschl's gyrus,Interindividual variability,Pitch,Sound perception,Timbre`,number: `3`,pages: `315--328`,title: `The neural basis of individual holistic and spectral sound perception`,volume: `28`,year: `2009`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Neural Science/2009 The Neural Basis of Individual Holistic and Spectral Sound Perception - Schneider and Wengenroth.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

In the case of digital waveguide modeling of piano strings these are normally neglected. Some recent reports have suggested that all four traveling waves should be considered, at least at the neighborhood of interaction points (i.e., the hammer and the boundaries). This paper investigates the effect of omitting string stiffness in the context of sound synthesis of the piano by physical modeling. A stiff, lossy string with a spatially distributed hammer force excitation is implemented using both a finite-difference time-domain scheme and a digital waveguide model. The two models are designed so as to have the exact same features but for the two stiffness-related solutions. Numerical experiments are employed to study the contact force and string velocity signals for different initial hammer velocity values. The results generally confirm that the two fast-decaying waves have only a marginal effect on the overall string motion. However, small audible differences result for bass strings struck with high initial hammer velocities.`,doi: `10.1121/1.4784255`,issn: `0001-4966`,journal: `The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America`,number: `4`,pages: `2684`,shorttitle: `Physical modeling of the piano`,title: `Physical modeling of the piano: An investigation into the effect of string stiffness on the hammer string interaction.`,volume: `125`,year: `2009`},

Peeters`,editor: ` `,abstract: `In this paper we investigate the problem of locating singing voice in music tracks. As opposed to most existing methods for this task, we rely on the extraction of the characteristics speciﬁc to singing voice. In our approach we suppose that the singing voice is characterized by harmonicity, formants, vibrato and tremolo. In the present study we deal only with the vibrato and tremolo characteristics. For this, we ﬁrst extract sinusoidal partials from the musical audio signal . The frequency modulation (vibrato) and amplitude modulation (tremolo) of each partial are then studied to determine if the partial corresponds to singing voice and hence the corresponding segment is supposed to contain singing voice. For this we estimate for each partial the rate (frequency of the modulations) and the extent (amplitude of modulation) of both vibrato and tremolo. A partial selection is then operated based on these values. A second criteria based on harmonicity is also introduced. Based on this, each segment can be labelled as singing or non-singing. Post-processing of the segmentation is then applied in order to remove short-duration segments. The proposed method is then evaluated on a large manually annotated test-set. The results of this evaluation are compared to the one obtained with a usual machine learning approach (MFCC and SFM modeling with GMM). The proposed method achieves very close results to the machine learning approach : 76.8/% compared to 77.4/% F-measure (frame classiﬁcation). This result is very promising, since both approaches are orthogonal and can then be combined.`,annote: `event-place: Taipei, Taiwan`,doi: `10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959926`,isbn: `9781424423538`,journal: `2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing`,pages: `1685--1688`,publisher: `IEEE`,title: `Singing voice detection in music tracks using direct voice vibrato detection`,url: `http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/4912736/4959496/04959926.pdf?arnumber=4959926`,year: `2009`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/2009 Singing voice detection in music tracks using direct voice vibrato detection - Regnier and Peeters.pdf`,tags: `#retrieved,#merged`},

The acoustic guitar is a result of centuries of design and development with wood, and has evolved into an archetypal and traditional product with a relatively conservative user base. As with many other product sectors, most acoustic guitars are now mass-produced in China, where low labour costs contribute to an average out-of-factory price of just \$20 USID. This paper describes research into a dramatic shift in guitar materials, away from wood fabrication, towards the assembly of industrially moulded thermoplastic components. It is proposed that such a shift in materials can lead to competitive mass-manufacture of acoustic guitars outside of low labour cost countries, whilst invigorating the design of this popular musical instrument. Emphasis is placed on articulating the technical, aesthetic, market, and commercial requirements of a thermoplastic acoustic guitar. The crucial issue of sourcing appropriate forms of advice to aid product design is discussed. Focus is on the guitar soundboard, as the principal sound-generating component of the instrument. Three conclusions are reached, based on the patented soundboard technology that emerged from the research. First, instruments constructed. with foamed polycarbonate soundboards can rival the quality of wood counterparts, opening the way for a possible new industry of polymer musical instruments. Second, foamed polycarbonate soundboards have physical material properties surprisingly different to wood yet give equivalent acoustic performance. And third, innovation in this product sector benefits more from designerly ways of knowing and operating and less from scientific discoveries.`,issn: `0258-5316`,journal: `Metu Journal of the Faculty of Architecture`,keywords: `Designerly ways of knowing,Guitar,Industrial design,Material selection,Plastics,Product innovation`,number: `1`,pages: `157--175`,title: `Materials-inspired innovation for acoustic guitar design`,volume: `26`,year: `2009`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Guitar/MATERIALS-INSPIRED INNOVATION   FOR ACOUSTIC GUITAR DESIGN - Pedgley et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

The physical properties and history of sound are fascinating to study. Barry Parker's tour of the physics of music details the science of how instruments, the acoustics of rooms, electronics, and humans create and alter the varied sounds we hear. Using physics as a base, Parker discusses the history of music, how sounds are made and perceived, and the various effects of acting on sounds. In the process, he demonstrates what acoustics can teach us about quantum theory and explains the relationship between harmonics and the theory of waves. Peppered throughout with anecdotes and examples illustrating key concepts, this invitingly written book provides a firm grounding in the actual and theoretical physics of music. /textcopyright 2009 The Johns Hopkins University Press.

It has been argued to be a crucial mechanism for open-ended cognitive development in humans, and as such has gathered a growing interest from developmental roboticists in the recent years. The goal of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a synthesis of the different approaches of intrinsic motivation in psychology. Second, by interpreting these approaches in a computational reinforcement learning framework, we argue that they are not operational and even sometimes inconsistent. Third, we set the ground for a systematic operational study of intrinsic motivation by presenting a formal typology of possible computational approaches. This typology is partly based on existing computational models, but also presents new ways of conceptualizing intrinsic motivation. We argue that this kind of computational typology might be useful for opening new avenues for research both in psychology and developmental robotics. /textcopyright2007 Oudeyer and Kaplan.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1410.5401`,doi: `10.3389/neuro.12.006.2007`,eprint: `1410.5401`,isbn: `00280836`,issn: `16625218`,journal: `Frontiers in Neurorobotics`,keywords: `Artificial intelligence,Cognitive development,Computational modeling,Curiosity,Developmental robotics,Exploration,Intrinsic motivation,Reinforcement learning,Reward,other`,number: `NOV`,pages: `1--26`,pmid: `18958277`,title: `What is intrinsic motivation?

As a result, project managers have little guidanceon how to manage teams who are using agile methodologies. Arguing thatthe most effective control modes are those that provide teams withautonomy in determining the methods for achieving project objectives, wepropose hypotheses related to the interaction between control modes,agile methodology use, and requirements change. We test the model in afield study of 862 software developers in 110 teams.

Thepurpose of this paper is to investigate internal and external factorsthat drive the choice of lean and agile operations capabilities andtheir respective impact on operational performance.Design/methodology/approach - Lean and agile manufacturing are eachconceptualized as a second-order factor and measured through a bundle ofdistinct practices. The competitive intensity of industry and thecompetitive strategy are modeled as potential external and internaldrivers, respectively, and the impact on quality, delivery, cost, andflexibility performance is analyzed using structural equations modeling.The model is tested with data from the high performance manufacturingproject comprising a total of 211 plants from three industries and sevencountries.Findings - The results indicate that lean and agile manufacturing differin terms of drivers and outcomes. The choice of a cost-leadershipstrategy fully mediates the impact of the competitive intensity ofindustry as a driver of lean manufacturing, while agile manufacturing isdirectly affected by both internal and external drivers, i.e. adifferentiation strategy as well as the competitive intensity ofindustry. Agile manufacturing is found to be negatively associated witha cost-leadership strategy, emphasizing the difference between lean andagile manufacturing. The major differences in performance outcomes arerelated to cost and flexibility, such that lean manufacturing has asignificant impact on cost performance (whereas agile manufacturing hasnot), and that agile manufacturing has a stronger relationship withvolume as well as product mix flexibility than does lean manufacturing.Research limitations/implications - Cross-sectional data from threeindustries and seven countries are used, and it would be interesting totest this model for more industries and countries.Practical implications - The results provide insights into the factorsthat influence the choice of lean or agile manufacturing for improvingoperations, and the results that can be obtained.Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the firstlarge-scale empirical survey of leanness and agility simultaneously,using data from manufacturing firms in Europe, Asia, and North America.The model incorporates a wide perspective on factors related to lean andagile manufacturing, to be able to identify similarities anddifferences.`,address: `HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND`,doi: `10.1108/01443570910993456`,issn: `0144-3577`,journal: `INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT`,keywords: `Lean production; Agile production; Operations mana`,number: `10`,pages: `976--999`,publisher: `EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED`,title: `Lean and agile manufacturing: external and internal drivers and performance outcomes`,volume: `29`,year: `2009`},

By the time Umberto Eco published his best-selling novel The Name of the Rose, he was one of Italy's most celebrated intellectuals, a distinguished academic and the author of influential works on semiotics. Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, How to Write a Thesis, in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis―from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, How to Write a Thesis has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English. Eco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. How to Write a Thesis is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid "thesis neurosis" and he answers the important question "Must You Read Books?" He reminds students "You are not Proust" and "Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft." Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data.How to Write a Thesis belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere.

It provides the essential foundations for the theory as well as the basic facts relating to almost periodicity. In six structured and self-contained chapters, the author unifies the treatment of various classes of almost periodic functions, while uniquely addressing oscillations and waves in the almost periodic case. The first half of the book lays the groundwork, noting the basic properties of almost periodic functions, while the second half of this work addresses applications whose main emphasis is on the solvability of ordinary or partial differential equations in the class of almost periodic functions. Key topics include: An introduction to metric spaces; Definition of several classes of almost periodic functions, including those of Bohr, Besicovitch, and Stepanov; Classical results on the mean value property; Convergence of Fourier series to any almost periodic function; Almost periodic solutions for ODEs in a linear setting; Almost periodic nonlinear oscillations; Almost periodic waves, including heat waves. The reader is taken from elementary and well-known facts through the latest results in almost periodic oscillation and waves. This is the first text to present these latest results. The presentation level and inclusion of several clearly presented proofs make this work ideal for graduate students in engineering and science. The concept of almost periodicity is widely applicable to continuuum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, plasma physics, dynamical systems, and astronomy, which makes the book a useful tool for mathematicians and physicists. /textcopyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

This paper addresses the most critical points, where Petrobras is making a great R&D effort, which are: Well technology, where casing stability, well cost and productivity are addressed, in a scenario of water depths beyond 2,200m, target depths greater than 5,000m, crossing salt layers that can reach 2,000m in thickness. Poorly known microbial carbonate reservoir, heterogeneous in vertical profile, spread over very large areas, with wettability concerns, requiring careful evaluation of the performance of the waterflooding method and EOR. Wax deposition, due to low temperature in the ocean bottom, imposing limitations to the subsea layout. Gas processing and exporting technologies concerning environmental issues: CO2 compact removal units aiming the minimization of emissions to the atmosphere. Production units placed in more than 2,000m water depth, with oceanic conditions quite severe and dealing with high CO2 content stream. These challenges deserve all Petrobras attention, but also count with the confidence in achieving good technological solutions, supported by the history of successful developments of the company. Introduction The history of success built by Petrobras in deep water Brazilian coast - mainly Campos Basin - was largely supported by successive discoveries of heavy oil in turbidite sandstones, step by step towards gradually deeper and deeper water depths (Carminatti et al., 2009). The Pre-salt discoveries of Santos Basin represent discovery of huge volumes of light oil (28 to 30 degrees API), with high gas content, in a very short time span, close the most important consuming centers in Southeastern Brazil, and formation tests in the first wells have presented very high flow rates with no indication of barriers. All are excellent news, although PETROBRAS and partners recognize that the Pre-salt of Santos Basin represents a challenging scenario: ultra-deep water (greater then 2,000 meters), deep carbonate reservoirs (deeper than 5,000 meters), spread over very large areas, with high gas-oil ratio (GOR in Tupi area greater than 200 m3/m3), CO2 content (8-12% in Tupi), high-pressure and low temperature, laying immediately bellow a thick salt layer (more than 2,000 meters of salt), located around 300 km from the coast, with oceanic conditions more severe than Campos Basin. This scenario demands using sometimes present day technology in the limit, and other times, adaption and development of technologies specific for such conditions. This paper addresses the most critical points to the development of production in the Pre-salt of Santos Basin, where Petrobras is making an R&D effort to develop and qualify new technologies, including well technology, reservoir technology, flow assurance, gas processing and exporting technologies, and production units. Additionally, the paper discusses briefly how PETROBRAS has organized its structure to face these technological challenges, including the creation of a technological program - PROSAL - focused on Pre-salt objectives.`,doi: `10.4043/otc-19880-ms`,journal: `Proceedings of Offshore Technology Conference`,publisher: `The Offshore Technology Conference`,title: `Challenges and New Technologies for the Development of the Pre-Salt Cluster, Santos Basin, Brazil`,url: `http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=OTC-19880-MS///////%5C%5C&soc=OTC`,year: `2009`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Pre Sal/2009 SS Pre-salt Santos basin - Challenges and New Technologies for the Development of the Pre-salt Cluster, Santos Basin, Brazil - Beltrao et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

To derive the estimator, we start from the characteristic differential equation of a sinusoid. To remove differentials and obtain an algebraic relation for frequency, we introduce finite-period weighted integrals of the differential equation, which become equivalent to the differential equation when a sufficient number of weight functions are applied. As weight functions, we show that Fourier kernels have excellent properties. Terms related to integral boundaries are readily eliminated, observations are provided by Fourier coefficients, and the relation becomes independently accurate for multiple sinusoids if they are sufficiently spaced. We solve the obtained equations in two ways: one is for approaching to the Cram/'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB), and the other is for enhancing the interference rejection capability. Also, methods are proposed to calculate the weighted integrals from sampled signals with an improved accuracy. Proposed algorithms are examined under noise and sinusoidal interference. Error variances are compared with the CRLB and other fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based methods. /textcopyright 2009 IEEE.`,doi: `10.1109/TSP.2009.2021501`,issn: `1053587X`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing`,keywords: `Differential equations,Fast Fourier transform (FFT),Frequency estimation,Spectral analysis,Weighted integral`,number: `9`,pages: `3317--3329`,title: `An exact direct method of sinusoidal parameter estimation derived from finite fourier integral of differential equation`,volume: `57`,year: `2009`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Harmonic Analysis/Fourier Transform/2009 An Exact Direct Method of Sinusoidal Parameter Estimation Derived From Finite Fourier Integral of Differential Equation - Ando and Nara.pdf`},

The conformal monogenic signal contains the monogenic signal as a special case for i1D signals and combines monogenic scale space, phase, direction/orientation, energy and curvature in one unified algebraic framework. The conformal monogenic signal will be theoretically illustrated and motivated in detail by the relation of the 3D Radon transform and the generalized Hilbert transform on the sphere. The main idea is to lift up 2D signals to the higher dimensional conformal space where the signal features can be analyzed with more degrees of freedom.

We present the GASP-WEBT optical and radio light curves of thisblazar obtained in July-November 2007, about various AGILE pointings atthe source. We construct NIR-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs),by assembling GASP-WEBT data together with UV data from the Swift ToOobservations of late October.Results. We observe a contemporaneous optical-radio outburst, which is arare and interesting phenomenon in blazars. The shape of the SEDs duringthe outburst appears peculiarly wavy because of an optical excess and aUV drop- and-rise. The optical light curve is well sampled during theAGILE pointings, showing prominent and sharp flares. A futurecross-correlation analysis of the optical and AGILE data will shed lighton the expected relationship between these flares and the gamma-rayevents.`,address: `17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE`,doi: `10.1051/0004-6361:200809552`,issn: `0004-6361`,journal: `ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS`,keywords: `galaxies : active; galaxies : BL Lacertae objects`,month: `apr`,number: `2`,pages: `L79----L82`,publisher: `EDP SCIENCES S A`,title: `Multifrequency monitoring of the blazar 0716+714 during the GASP-WEBT-AGILE campaign of 2007`,volume: `481`,year: `2008`,tags: `#corrupted author,#merged`},

Fuzzy logic is a reasoning system based on a foundation of fuzzy set theory, itself an extension of classical set theory, where set membership can be partial as opposed to all or none, as in the binary features of classical logic. Fuzzy logic is a relatively new discipline in which major advances have been made over the last decade or so with regard to theory and applications. Following on from the successful first edition, this fully updated new edition is therefore very timely and much anticipated. Concentration on the topics of fuzzy logic combined with an abundance of worked examples, chapter problems and commercial case studies is designed to help motivate a mainstream engineering audience, and the book is further strengthened by the inclusion of an online solutions manual as well as dedicated software codes. Senior undergraduate and postgraduate students in most engineering disciplines, academics and practicing engineers, plus some working in economics, control theory, operational research etc, will all find this a valuable addition to their bookshelves.`,edition: `2`,pagetotal: `650`,publisher: `Wiley`,title: `Fuzzy Logic with Engineering Applications`,year: `2008`,tags: `tesse`},

This article presents the results from a study whichexamined the impact of XP and SCRUM practices on communication withinsoftware development teams and within the focal organization. Theresearch was carried out as a case study in F-Secure where two agilesoftware development projects were compared from the communicationperspective. The goal of the study is to increase the understanding ofcommunication in the context of agile software development: internallyamong the developers and project leaders and in the interface betweenthe development team and stakeholders (i.e. customers, testers, otherdevelopment teams). The study shows that agile practices improve bothinformal and formal communication. However, it further indicates that,in larger development situations involving multiple externalstakeholders, a mismatch of adequate communication mechanisms cansometimes even hinder the communication. The study highlights the factthat hurdles and improvements in the communication process can bothaffect the feature requirements and task subtask dependencies asdescribed in coordination theory. While the use of SCRUM and some XPpractices facilitate team and organizational communication of thedependencies between product features and working tasks, the use ofagile practices requires that the team and organization use alsoadditional plan-driven practices to ensure the efficiency of externalcommunication between all the actors of software development.`,address: `VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS`,doi: `10.1007/s10664-008-9065-9`,issn: `1382-3256`,journal: `EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING`,keywords: `agile software development practices; communicatio`,month: `jun`,number: `3`,pages: `303--337`,publisher: `SPRINGER`,title: `The impact of agile practices on communication in software development`,volume: `13`,year: `2008`},

Thereby, the TLS approach in statistics is sometimes called an errors-in-variables (EIV) modelling and, moreover, this type of regression is usually known as an orthogonal regression. We take an EIV regression model into account. Necessary algebraic tools are introduced in order to construct the TLS estimator. A comparison with the classical ordinary least squares estimator is illustrated. Consequently, the existence and uniqueness of the TLS estimator are discussed. Finally, we show the large sample properties of the TLS estimator, i.e. a strong and weak consistency, and an asymptotic distribution.`,isbn: `9788073780654`,journal: `WDS’08 Proceedings of Contributed Papers: Part I–Mathematics and Computer Sciences`,pages: `88--93`,title: `Total Least Squares Approach in Regression Methods`,url: `https://www.mff.cuni.cz/veda/konference/wds/proc/pdf08/WDS08_115_m4_Pesta.pdf`,year: `2008`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/total last squares/2008 Total Least Squares Approach in Regression Methods - Peˇsta.pdf`,tags: `least squares`},

Dans les années 1980 et 1990, ces projets se sont faits plus rares dans bien des endroits, répondant à la contestation populaire et au désaccord des intellectuels, parallèlement à une préoccupation nouvelle pour la préservation. Dernièrement, pourtant, les mégaprojets ont réapparu, souvent associés à un aménagement touristique ou sportif et intégrant des créations d'architectes de renommée mondiale. Ils se situent fréquemment sur le site d'anciennes décharges ou usines abandonnées. Le symposium dont ce texte sert d'introduction montre la convergence croissante des projets nord-américains et européens, convergence que l'on constate dans leur forme physique, leur financement et dans le rôle que joue l'État dans un monde empreint de néolibéralisme. En même temps, les nouveaux projets affichent une sensibilitéà l'environnement et un engagement vis-à-vis de l'urbanité plus marqués que les programmes modernistes antérieurs.`,doi: `10.1111/j.1468-2427.2008.00829.x`,issn: `1468-2427`,journal: `International Journal of Urban and Regional Research`,langid: `english`,number: `4`,pages: `759--767`,rights: `© 2009 The Authors.

Games represent a widely accepted paradigm for representing interactive decision-making. We explored the potential value of neural networks for modeling and predicting human interactive learning in repeated games. We found that even very simple learning networks, driven by regret-based feedback, accurately predict observed human behavior in different experiments on 21 games with unique equilibria in mixed strategies. Introducing regret in the feedback dramatically improved the performance of the neural network. We show that regret-based models provide better predictions of learning than established economic models.`,doi: `10.1126/science.1151185`,issn: `00368075`,journal: `Science`,number: `5866`,pages: `1111--1113`,pmid: `18292345`,title: `Predicting human interactive learning by regret-driven neural networks`,volume: `319`,year: `2008`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2008MarchioriPredicting Predicting Human Interactive Learning by Regret Driven Neural Networks.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

For constant velocities the equation for the radius of curvature reduces to the original Huygens' Principle. The variable RV can be computed during ray tracing and used to determine the local radius of curvature, which in turn can be used in geometrical spreading, amplitude corrections and structure interpretation. /textcopyright 2008 The Authors Journal compilation /textcopyright 2008 RAS.`,doi: `10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03699.x`,issn: `0956540X`,journal: `Geophysical Journal International`,keywords: `Body waves,Computational seismology,Non-linear differential equations,Theoretical seismology,Wave propagation`,number: `3`,pages: `1117--1122`,title: `A geometrical approach to time evolving wave fronts`,volume: `172`,year: `2008`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/approx k segments/2008 A geometrical approach to time evolving wave fronts - Madrid.pdf`},

The intestinaltract was considered to be sufficiently patent if the capsule wasexcreted intact or if the capsule was not detected by the scanner at 30hours after ingestion. if patency was established, then standard CE wasperformed.Setting: International multicenter study.Patients: A total of 106 patients with known strictures.Intervention: Agile patency system.Main Outcome Measurements: Performance and safety of Agile patencysystem.Results: A total of 106 patients ingested the patency capsule.Fifty-nine (56%) excreted it intact and subsequently underwent CE.There were no cases of capsule retention.

The reason for this foreseen spectrumshortage is reported not to be the scarcity of the radio spectrum butthe inefficiency of current spectrum access methods, thus leavingspectrum opportunities along both the time and frequency dimensions thatwireless devices can exploit. Fortunately, recent technological advanceshave made it possible to build software-defined radios (SDRs), which,unlike traditional radios, can switch from one frequency band to anotherat little or no cost. We propose a MAC protocol, called OpportunisticSpectrum MAC (OS-MAC), for wireless networks equipped with cognitiveradios like SDRs. OS-MAC 1) adaptively and dynamically seeks andexploits opportunities in both licensed and unlicensed spectra and alongboth the time and frequency dimensions, 2) accesses and shares spectrumamong different unlicensed and licensed users, and 3) coordinates withother unlicensed users for better spectrum utilization. Using extensivesimulation, OS-MAC is shown to be far more effective than current accessprotocols from both the network's and the user's perspectives.

The formulas for length and curvature of a discrete curve (a polygon) are immediately amenable to computation. Convergence guarantees that in the presence of abundant computational resources we may refine our discrete curve until the measurements we take match to arbitrary precision their counterparts on a smooth curve. We discussed an example of structure preservation, namely that the Turning Number Theorem holds exactly for discrete curves, even for coarse mesh sizes. If we wrote an algorithm whose correctness relied on the Turning Number Theorem, then the algorithm could be applied to our discrete curve. The following chapters will extend our exploration of discrete analogues of the objects of differential geometry to the settings of surfaces and volumes and to application areas spanning physical simulation (thin shells and fluids) and geometric modeling (remeshing and parameterization). In each application area algorithms make use of mathematical structures that are carried over from the continuous to the discrete realm.

These wastes are produced in all stages of the process: wood preparation, pulp and paper manufacture, chemical recovery, recycled paper processing, waste water treatment. Energy recovery from wastes of different origin has become a generally accepted alternative to their disposal. Pulp and paper industry expresses an interest in adapting and integrating advanced biomass energy conversion technologies into its mill operations. Industrial adoption of these new technologies has the potential for higher efficiency, lower capital cost, and safer operation than conventional operations that bum fossil fuels for energy. Incineration with energy recovery has the advantage of hygienic disposal, volume reduction, and the recovery of thermal energy by means of steam or super heated water that can be used for heating and power generation. The paper reviews the current state and tendencies in using as a fuel of solid wastes generated in pulp and paper mills. A description of biomass-derived wastes regarding their opportunity to be used for energy recovery is presented. The heating properties of wood wastes, rejects from recycled paper processing, paper sludge and low-quality recovered paper grades are discussed.

We used the example of a keyword search to evaluate the usefulness of these databases in biomedical information retrieval and a specific published article to evaluate their utility in performing citation analysis. All databases were practical in use and offered numerous search facilities. PubMed and Google Scholar are accessed for free. The keyword search with PubMed offers optimal update frequency and includes online early articles; other databases can rate articles by number of citations, as an index of importance. For citation analysis, Scopus offers about 20% more coverage than Web of Science, whereas Google Scholar offers results of inconsistent accuracy. PubMed remains an optimal tool in biomedical electronic research. Scopus covers a wider journal range, of help both in keyword searching and citation analysis, but it is currently limited to recent articles (published after 1995) compared with Web of Science.

Items are placed in the knapsack sequentially, and the act of placing an item in the knapsack instantiates its size. Our goal is to compute a solution "policy" that maximizes the expected value of items successfully placed in the knapsack, where the final overflowing item, contributes no value. We consider both nonadaptive policies (that designate a priori a fixed sequence of items to insert) and adaptive policies (that can make dynamic choices based on the instantiated sizes of items placed in the knapsack thus far). An important facet of our work lies in characterizing the benefit of adaptivity. For this purpose we advocate the use of a measure called the adaptivity gap: the ratio of the expected value obtained by an optimal adaptive policy to that obtained by an optimal nonadaptive policy. We bound the adaptivity gap of the stochastic knapsack problem by demonstrating a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a nonadaptive policy whose expected value approximates that of an optimal adaptive policy to within a factor of four. We also devise a polynomial-time adaptive policy that approximates the optimal adaptive policy to within a factor of 3 + \$/epsilon\$ for any constant \$/epsilon\$ > 0. /textcopyright2008 INFORMS.`,doi: `10.1287/moor.1080.0330`,issn: `0364765X`,journal: `Mathematics of Operations Research`,keywords: `Adaptivity,Approximation algorithm,Knapsack problem,Stochastic models`,number: `4`,pages: `945--964`,title: `Approximating the stochastic knapsack problem: The benefit of adaptivity`,volume: `33`,year: `2008`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/DeanApproximating Approximating the Stochastic Knapsack Problem_ the Beneﬁt of Adaptivity.pdf`,tags: `#corrupted author,#merged`},

Agile softwareengineering methods have recently emerged as a new and different way ofdeveloping software as compared to the traditional methodologies.However, their success has mostly been anecdotal, and research in thissubject is still scant in the academic circles. This research study wasa survey study on the critical success factors of Agile softwaredevelopment projects using quantitative approach.Based on existing literature, a preliminary list of potential criticalsuccess factors of Agile projects were identified and compiled.Subsequently, reliability analysis and factor analysis were conducted toconsolidate this preliminary list into a final set of 12 possiblecritical success factors for each of the four project success categories- Quality, Scope, Time, and Cost.A survey was conducted among Agile professionals, gathering survey datafrom 109 Agile projects from 25 countries across the world. Multipleregression techniques were used, both at the full regression model andat the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure.The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported,identifying three critical success factors for Agile softwaredevelopment projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile SoftwareEngineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability.Limitations of the study are discussed together with interpretations forpractitioners. To ensure success of their projects, managers are urgedto focus on choosing a high-caliber team, practicing Agile engineeringtechniques and following Agile-style delivery strategy.

The creation of frequency-agile metamaterials would extendthe spectral range over which devices function and, further, enable themanufacture of new devices such as dynamically tunable notch filters.Here, we demonstrate such frequency-agile metamaterials operating in thefar-infrared by incorporating semiconductors in critical regions ofmetallic split-ring resonators.

The focus is on algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic background in algorithms.

The investigation is based on the CAplus database of Chemical Abstracts Service, the INSPEC database of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Web of Science (WoS) of Thomson Reuters. The time evolution of the publications shows a dramatic increase since 2004 when graphene has been isolated for the first time. The graphene literature has been analyzed with respect to the most productive authors, research organizations, countries of authors, and the leading journals. Furthermore, the time evolution of the major graphene based research topics and the top 10 most productive research organizations with respect to their specific topics have been analyzed and are shown as heat maps. In addition, the graphene research landscape has been established using the analysis tool STN AnaVist. Finally, a brief citation analysis has been performed. The time evolution of the impact reveals that, rather similar to the output evolution, the impact increase of the graphene papers within the starting period is possibly going to outrun the impact increase of the fullerenes and nanotubes papers.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `0808.3320`,eprint: `0808.3320`,pages: `1--15`,title: `Graphene - A rising star in view of scientometrics`,url: `http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3320`,year: `2008`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Bibliometry/2018 Graphene - A rising star in view of scientometrics.pdf`},

A website gives access to the data files used in the text, and, for instructors, the remaining solutions.

Quite a number of the early research results are now standard components of many audio and music devices and new technologies are continuously being developed and integrated into new products. Through the years there have been important changes. For example, most of the abstract algorithms that were the focus of work in the 70s and 80s are considered obsolete. Then the 1990s saw the emergence of computational approaches that aimed either at capturing the characteristics of a sound source, known as physical models, or at capturing the perceptual characteristics of the sound signal, generally referred to as spectral or signal models. More recent trends include the combination of physical and spectral models and the corpus-based concatenative methods. But the field faces major challenges that might revolutionize the standard paradigms and applications of sound synthesis. In this article we will first place the sound synthesis topic within its research context, then we will highlight some of the current trends, and finally we will attempt to identify some challenges for the future. /textcopyright 2007 IEEE.`,doi: `10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412805`,isbn: `1424412749`,journal: `2007 IEEE 9Th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing, MMSP 2007 - Proceedings`,keywords: `Sound and music computing,Sound synthesis`,pages: `9--12`,title: `State of the art and future directions in musical sound synthesis`,year: `2007`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Musical/2007 State of the Art and Future Directions in Musical Sound Synthesis - Serra.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

In addition, while the notion of the genotype has received significant attention from philosophers of biology, the notion of the phenotype has not. Recent developments in the technology of measuring gene-expression levels have made it possible to conceive of phenotypic traits in terms of levels of gene expression. We demonstrate that not only has this become possible but it has also become an actual practice. This suggests a significant change in our conception of the phenotype: as in the case of the 'genotype', phenotypes can now be conceived in quantitative and measurable terms on a comprehensive molecular level. We discuss in what sense gene expression profiles can be regarded as phenotypic traits and whether these traits are better described as a novel concept of phenotype or as an extension of the classical concept. We argue for an extension of the classical concept and call for an examination of the type of extension involved. /textcopyright2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, more than 10,000 citing and purportedly citing documents were examined. Results show that Scopus significantly alters the relative ranking of those scholars that appear in the middle of the rankings and that GS stands out in its coverage of conference proceedings as well as international, non-English language journals. The use of Scopus and GS, in addition to WoS, helps reveal a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the scholarly impact of authors.

The weighted and structured total least-squares problems have no such analytic solution and are currently solved numerically by local optimization methods. We explain how special structure of the weight matrix and the data matrix can be exploited for efficient cost function and first derivative computation. This allows to obtain computationally efficient solution methods. The total least-squares family of methods has a wide range of applications in system theory, signal processing, and computer algebra.

  {key: `2007_bengio_etal1`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun and Yann Lecun`,abstract: `One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), rea- soning, intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, withmin- imal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally lim- ited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very ineffi- cient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Sec- ond, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learn- ing) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more ab- stract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence. 1`,doi: `10.1.1.72.4580`,isbn: `1002620262`,issn: `0009-9104`,journal: `Large Scale Kernel Machines`,keywords: `theory`,number: `1`,pages: `321--360`,pmid: `11359439`,title: `Scaling Learning Algorithms towards AI`,year: `2007`,tags: `#merged,tesse,theory`},

We are concerned with the dual, frequency-domain problem. We derive the relationship between the discrete-frequency linear autocorrelation of a spectrum and the temporal envelope of a signal. In particular, we focus on the real spectrum obtained by a type-I odd-length discrete cosine transform (DCT-Io) which leads to the all-pole envelope of the corresponding symmetric squared Hilbert temporal envelope. A compact linear algebra notation for the familiar concepts of AR modeling clearly reveals the dual symmetries between modeling in time and frequency domains. By using AR models in both domains in cascade, we can jointly estimate the temporal and spectral envelopes of a signal. We model the temporal envelope of the residual of regular AR modeling to efficiently capture signal structure in the most appropriate domain. /textcopyright 2007 IEEE.`,doi: `10.1109/TSP.2007.898783`,issn: `1053587X`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing`,keywords: `Autoregressive (AR) modeling,Frequency-domain linear prediction (FDLP),Hilbert envelope,Linear prediction in spectral domain (LPSD),Temporal noise shaping (TNS)`,number: `11`,pages: `5237--5245`,title: `Autoregressive modeling of temporal envelopes`,volume: `55`,year: `2007`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/envelope/2007 Autoregressive Modeling of Temporal Envelopes - Athineos and Ellis.pdf`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,annote: `OCLC: 938669307`,isbn: `9788578110796`,issn: `1098-6596`,journal: `Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling`,keywords: `icle`,number: `9`,pages: `1689--1699`,pmid: `25246403`,publisher: `Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg`,title: `Neural Networks Theory`,volume: `53`,year: `2007`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Artificial Intelligence/2007 Neural networks theory - Galushkin.pdf`},

In many brain structures, action potential activity is considered to be sparse. This sparseness of activity has been exploited to reduce the computational cost of large-scale network simulations, through the development of event-driven simulation schemes. However, existing event-driven simulations schemes use extremely simplified neuronal models. Here, we implement and evaluate critically an event-driven algorithm (ED-LUT) that uses precalculated look-up tables to characterize synaptic and neuronal dynamics. This approach enables the use of more complex (and realistic) neuronal models or data in representing the neurons, while retaining the advantage of high-speed simulation. We demonstrate the method's application for neurons containing exponential synaptic conductances, thereby implementing shunting inhibition, a phenomenon that is critical to cellular computation. We also introduce an improved two-stage event-queue algorithm, which allows the simulations to scale efficiently to highly connected networks with arbitrary propagation delays. Finally, the scheme readily accommodates implementation of synaptic plasticity mechanisms that depend on spike timing, enabling future simulations to explore issues of long-term learning and adaptation in large-scale networks. /textcopyright 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.`,doi: `10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.2959`,issn: `08997667`,journal: `Neural Computation`,number: `12`,pages: `2959--2993`,pmid: `17052155`,title: `Event-driven simulation scheme for spiking neural networks using lookup tables to characterize neuronal dynamics`,volume: `18`,year: `2006`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Spiking Neural Networks/2006 Event-driven simulation scheme for spiking neural networks using lookup tables to characterize neuronal dynamics.pdf`},

  {key: `2006_reiffenstein1`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Tim Reiffenstein`,abstract: `Recent research in economic geography has emphasized tacit knowledge as the basis of industrial learning. In contrast, codification and the practices of industrial writing have received little attention for the roles they play in mobilizing knowledge across space. This paper offers insight into the geographies of codification through an examination of technology transfer in the electronic musical instrument industry between 1965 and 1995. The research draws on a variety of primary and secondary data that include interviews with inventors, biographical accounts and patent analysis. These sources offer perspective on the career trajectories of three U.S. inventors who transferred knowledge from various contexts in California's high-tech industry to the Japanese firm, Yamaha. Conceptually, the paper draws on the actor-network theory and Latour's idea of translation to highlight the detours inventors must take to register novelty. The analysis reveals the problematic nature of codified knowledge and its transfer; in this case codified knowledge was mobile internationally but not locally, at least until it reached Japan. The paper argues for the need to understand how texts such as patents are produced-the context of their authorship, the geographies of their circulation and their efficacy for shaping further innovative practice. /textcopyright2006 Canadian Association of Geographers/L'Association canadienne des g/'eographes.`,doi: `10.1111/j.1541-0064.2006.00143.x`,issn: `00083658`,journal: `Canadian Geographer`,number: `3`,pages: `298--318`,title: `Codification, patents and the geography of knowledge transfer in the electronic musical instrument industry`,volume: `50`,year: `2006`,tags: `#merged`},

It presents a thorough treatment of ideas and techniques necessary for a firm understanding of the subject. The text is also recommended for use in discrete probability courses. The material is organized so that the discrete and continuous probability discussions are presented in a separate, but parallel, manner. This organization does not emphasize an overly rigorous or formal view of probabililty and therefore offers some strong pedagogical value. Hence, the discrete discussions can sometimes serve to motivate the more abstract continuous probability discussions. Features: Key ideas are developed in a somewhat leisurely style, providing a variety of interesting applications to probability and showing some nonintuitive ideas. Over 600 exercises provide the opportunity for practicing skills and developing a sound understanding of ideas. Numerous historical comments deal with the development of discrete probability.

(2006). The method utilizes the close geometric relationship between a spline regression function and its control polygon, with vertices whose y-coordinates are the regression coefficients and whose x-coordinates are certain averages of the knots, known as the Greville sites. The method involves two stages, A and B. In stage A, a linear LS spline fit to the data is constructed, and viewed as the initial position of the control polygon of a higher order (n > 2) smooth spline curve. In stage B, the optimal set of knots of this higher order spline curve is found, so that its control polygon is as close to the initial polygon of stage A as possible, and finally the LS estimates of the regression coefficients of this curve are found. In Kaishev et al. (2006) the implementation of stage A has been thoroughly addressed and the pointwise asymptotic properties of the GeD spline estimator have been explored and used to construct asymptotic confidence intervals. In this paper, the focus of the attention is at giving further insight into the optimality properties of the knots of the higher order spline curve, obtained in stage B so that it is nearly a variation diminishing (shape preserving) spline approximation to the linear fit of stage A. Error bounds for this approximation are derived. Extensive numerical examples are provided, illustrating the performance of GeDS and the quality of the resulting LS spline fits. The GeDS estimator is compared with other existing variable knot spline methods and smoothing techniques and is shown to perform very well, producing nearly optimal spline regression models. It is fast and numerically efficient, since no deterministic or stochastic knot insertion/deletion and relocation search strategies are involved.

The structure and morphology of biodegradable nanocomposites were characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). It was revealed that UFTPCS were intercalated into the layers of MMT successfully, and layers of MMT were fully exfoliated and so formed the exfoliated nanocomposites with MMT.

  {key: `2006_green`,type: `book`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,author: `Edward Green`,abstract: `A wide range of music -- from Bach to Mozart and Brahms -- is marked by its use of some form of what is generally called "tonality": the tendency of music to focus melodically on some stable pitch or tonic and for its harmony to use functional triads. Yet few terms in music theory are more enigmatic than that seemingly simple word "tonality." Matthew Brown's Explaining Tonality: Schenkerian Theory and Beyond considers a number of disparate ways in which functional tonality has been understood. In particular, it focuses on the comprehensive theory developed by Heinrich Schenker in his monumental three-part treatise Neue musikalische Theorien und Phantasien (1906-1935). Schenker systematically investigated the ways in which lines and chords behave both locally within individual tonal phrases and globally across entire compositions. Explaining Tonality shows why Schenker was able to elucidate tonal relationships so successfully and the many advantages that his explanations have over those of his rivals. In addition, it proposes some ways in which Schenker's approach can be extended to tonal features in works from before Bach (such as Monteverdi) and after Brahms (such as Debussy, Stravinsky, and much popular music of today). Along the way, the book explores six methodological criteria that help in building, testing, and evaluating a plausible theory of tonality or, indeed, any other musical phenomenon: accuracy, scope, fruitfulness, consistency, simplicity, and coherence. It reveals how understanding the tonality of a piece can shed light on other aspects of musical composition. And, in conclusion, it describes some ways in which Schenkerian theory might fruitfully develop in the future.

However, there is not much knownabout the tailoring and engineering of agile methods, or about how thesemethods can be used to complement each other. This study investigatedtailoring of the agile methods, eXtreme programming (XP) and Scrum, atIntel Shannon, and involved experienced software engineers whocontinuously monitored and reflected on these methods over a 3- yearperiod. The study shows that agile methods may individually beincomplete in supporting the overall development process, but XP andScrum complement each other well, with XP providing support fortechnical aspects and Scrum providing support for project planning andtracking. The principles of XP and Scrum were carefully selected (onlysix of the 12 XP key practices were implemented, for example) andtailored to suit the needs of the development environment at IntelShannon. Thus, the study refutes the suggestion that agile methods arenot divisible or individually selectable but achieve their benefitsthrough the synergistic combination of individual agile practices;rather, this study shows that an a la carte selection and tailoring ofpractices can work very well. In the case of Scrum, some local tailoringhas led to a very committed usage by developers, in contrast to manydevelopment methods whose usage is limited despite being decreedmandatory by management. The agile practices that were applied did leadto significant benefits, including reductions in code defect density bya factor of 7.

Digital waveguides can be used to form a 1D model of the vocal tract, simplistically represented as a series of cylindrical tubes of varying radius along a straight axis. This 1D signal propagating element can also be extended to create a digital waveguide mesh (DWM), giving acoustical synthesis of a higher dimensional structure, such as a 2D surface or 3D space. The work contained in this thesis is an investigation into the effects of increased dimensionality in the 1D waveguide vocal tract paradigm. A 2D DWM is configured as a model of the tract, such that shape characteristics are set within the width of the mesh. Wave propagation and reflection is simulated along the tract from the glottis to the lips, as well as across it, between the two inner walls, thereby removing plane-wave limitations inherent in the 1D model. The 2D tract is found to give accurate formant synthesis, producing vowels that give a good match to real-world targets. However, problems associated with high sampling frequency limitations and discontinuous dynamic operation are identified. Movements readily occurring in speech, such as diphthongs, are not easily accommodated by the static mesh structure. A novel alternative approach is also presented which maintains a rect-angular mesh, but maps the changing tract shapes onto the waveguide impedances. This allows for stable dynamic manipulation of the modelled space. Furthermore, sampling frequency limitations are removed, such that real-time operation and interaction with the 2D tract model is achieved. i Contents Abstract i Acknowledgments xi Declaration xii`,journal: `Area`,number: `April`,pages: `40--47`,school: `The University of York`,title: `Physical modelling of the vocal tract with the 2D digital waveguide mesh`,url: `http://www-users.york.ac.uk/\$/sim\$dtm3/Download/JackThesis.pdf`,volume: `2006`,year: `2006`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Digital Waveguides/2006MullenPhysical Physical Modelling of the Vocal Tract with the 2D Digital Waveguide Mesh..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

Information and communications technologies enable the exchange of distributed sources of information in the open innovation process. The case study shows that furthermore a suite of new technologies for data mining, simulation, prototyping and visual representation, what we call 'innovation technology', help to support open innovation in Procter and Gamble.

The strength of this book is that it readdresses these shortcomings; by using examples, often from real-life and using real data, the authors can show how the fundamentals of probabilistic and statistical theories arise intuitively. It provides a tried and tested, self-contained course, that can also be used for self-study. A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics has numerous quick exercises to give direct feedback to the students. In addition the book contains over 350 exercises, half of which have answers, of which half have full solutions.

The only pre-requisite for the book is a first course in calculus; the text covers standard statistics and probability material, and develops beyond traditional parametric models to the Poisson process, and on to useful modern methods such as the bootstrap.

This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network. /textcopyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For years researchers looking for this type of information had only one resource to consult: the Web of Science from Thomson Scientific. In 2004 two competitors emerged – Scopus from Elsevier and Google Scholar from Google. The research reported here uses citation analysis in an observational study examining these three databases; comparing citation counts for articles from two disciplines (oncology and condensed matter physics) and two years (1993 and 2003) to test the hypothesis that the different scholarly publication coverage provided by the three search tools will lead to different citation counts from each. Methods: Eleven journal titles with varying impact factors were selected from each discipline (oncology and condensed matter physics) using the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). All articles published in the selected titles were retrieved for the years 1993 and 2003, and a stratified random sample of articles was chosen, resulting in four sets of articles. During the week of November 7–12, 2005, the citation counts for each research article were extracted from the three sources. The actual citing references for a subset of the articles published in 2003 were also gathered from each of the three sources. Results: For oncology 1993 Web of Science returned the highest average number of citations, 45.3. Scopus returned the highest average number of citations (8.9) for oncology 2003. Web of Science returned the highest number of citations for condensed matter physics 1993 and 2003 (22.5 and 3.9 respectively). The data showed a significant difference in the mean citation rates between all pairs of resources except between Google Scholar and Scopus for condensed matter physics 2003. For articles published in 2003 Google Scholar returned the largest amount of unique citing material for oncology and Web of Science returned the most for condensed matter physics. Conclusion: This study did not identify any one of these three resources as the answer to all citation tracking needs.

UTA methodology uses linear programming techniques in order to optimally infer additive value/utility functions, so that these functions are as consistent as possible with the global decision-maker’s preferences (inference principle). The main objective of this chapter is to analytically present the UTA method and its variants and to summarize the progress made in this field. The historical background and the philosophy of the aggregation-disaggregation approach are firstly given in this chapter. The detailed presentation of the basic UTA algorithm is presented, including the discussion on the stability and sensitivity analyses. Several variants of the UTA method, which incorporate different forms of optimality criteria used in the LP formulation, are also discussed. The implementation of the UTA methods is illustrated by a general overview of UTA-based DSSs, as well as real-world decision-making applications. Finally, several potential future research developments of the UTA methodologies within the context of MCDA are discussed through this chapter.`,doi: `10.1007/0-387-23081-5/////////_8`,isbn: `9780387230672`,journal: `Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys`,langid: `english`,location: `New York`,pages: `297--334`,publisher: `Springer-Verlag`,title: `UTA Methods`,urldate: `2019-03-31`,volume: `78`,year: `2005`,tags: `tesse`},

Parameters such as amplitude and pitch can control other aspects of the synthesis. This approach gives the player more control over details of the sound due to the use of the rich acoustic signal. Latency in sensing parameters, particularly pitch, is less of a problem because pitch information is carried directly by the acoustically generated signal.

Usui`,abstract: `Evolving gradient-learning artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a popular approach to address the local optima and design problems of ANN. The typical approach is to combine the strength of backpropagation (BP) in weight learning and EA’s capability of searching the architecture space. However, the BP’s "gradient descent" approach requires a highly computer-intensive operation that relatively restricts the search coverage of EA by compelling it to use a small population size. To address this problem, we utilized mutation-based genetic neural network (MGNN) to replace BP by using the mutation strategy of local adaptation of evolutionary programming (EP) to effect weight learning. The MGNN’s mutation enables the network to dynamically evolve its structure and adapt its weights at the same time. Moreover, MGNN’s EP-based encoding scheme allows for a ﬂexible and less restricted formulation of the ﬁtness function and makes ﬁtness computation fast and efﬁcient. This makes it feasible to use larger population sizes and allows MGNN to have a relatively wide search coverage of the architecture space. MGNN implements a stopping criterion where overﬁtness occurrences are monitored through "sliding-windows" to avoid premature learning and overlearning. Statistical analysis of its performance to some well-known classiﬁcation problems demonstrate its good generalization capability. It also reveals that locally adapting or scheduling the strategy parameters embedded in each individual network may provide a proper balance between the local and global searching capabilities of MGNN.`,doi: `10.1109/TNN.2005.844858`,issn: `1045-9227`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks`,langid: `english`,number: `3`,pages: `587--600`,title: `Mutation-Based Genetic Neural Network`,url: `http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1427764/`,urldate: `2019-04-05`,volume: `16`,year: `2005`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/2005 Mutation-Based Genetic Neural Network - Palmes et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged,evolutive,tesse`},

  {key: `2005_kyessi`,type: `article`,author: `Alphonce G Kyessi`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `Diminishing state resources coupled with inadequate urban management capacity and insufficiency of conventional approaches have rendered it impossible to provide basic infrastructure in urban areas in developing countries such as in the city of Dar es Salaam. In that situation fringe neighbourhoods are mostly hit. However, a notable phenomenon has emerged in informal and formal settlements where the communities, through self-help and local governance in their own neighbourhood associations, have organised to fill the gaps in infrastructure services left by the centralised institutions. Among other things, community groups mobilise and organise fund-raising, mutual self-help and external technical assistance to provide water supply and sanitation, roads and drainage channels within the immediate area. This seems to be a trend in infrastructure improvement in poor neighbourhoods including fringe settlements. Actors observed to be participating in the process of providing the basic services and facilities in some of the fringe settlements include Dar es Salaam City Council (DCC), the civil societies including political party organisations and private individuals as well as youth and women groups, and the donor community. This paper discusses the potentials and constraints existing in the provision of basic infrastructure to fringe settlements taking water management as an example. Potable water was chosen to explain the case because these settlements are not connected to the Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (DAWASA-a centralised institution) water supply system and are remotely located. The purpose is to inform policy makers, researchers and practitioners including water providers and managers and water users on potentials and constraints existing in the provision and management of water supply in remote poor communities. Potable water as an essential need plays a major role in health development and if water is not easily accessible much time is wasted to search for it. One of the questions to be answered is how the residents, most of them being poor, are coping up with the deficiency of water supply in their fringe areas. /textcopyright2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Good professionals make a considerable effort to remain current in their career fields. Professional associations assist their members in this task by developing training and professional development programs that address the critical skills that professionals need to do their jobs. In higher education and student affairs, many practitioners acknowledge the importance of knowing how the law affects what they do. Constitutional law affects what kinds of rules and regulations public institutions promulgate. Contract law affects the type of business relationship administrators have with students and other constituents. Tort law affects how managers maintain facilities and supervise student events. As a result, professional associations have been created to focus attention solely on legal issues in higher education (e.g., Education Law Association and the Association for Interdisciplinary Initiatives in Higher Education Law and Policy), programs on a wide variety of legal topics appear on almost every national conference schedule, many professional associations devote part of their Web sites to law and legislation (e.g., American College Personnel Association, National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and the Association for Student Judicial Affairs), and private companies publish newsletters designed to inform their readers about the latest court rulings (e.g., The College Student and the Courts by Gehring and Letzring, Synfax weekly report by Pavela). Some of these resources examine events that may be several years old since litigation takes time and initial decisions may be appealed. Many of the authors of these publications restate the facts of the particular case and give some guidance on appropriate administrative practice. These resources, however, may not always be able to identify what administrators might face on their own campuses in the near future or define decision-making processes that might help administrators avoid legal pitfalls. The purpose of this paper is to identify two important mechanisms that college administrators can use to more actively anticipate the legal issues that may occur on their own campuses. First, practitioners should scan the broad legal environment. Secondly, they should be aware of legal issues in other parts of the education enterprise.

Large instrumental databases with standardised intensities like the Virtual Orchestra are required. For each sound of the database, an average spectral envelope is calculated. An error minimisation algorithm optimises the similarity of the orchestration's envelope in relation to the phoneme.

In this work, we present a comparative study of the guitar box in which the interior gas is changed both experimentally and numerically.

This allows us to characterise the soundboard-back plate coupling via the cavity fluid, stressing the role of the structural and acoustic uncoupled modes. This could help guitar makers, allowing them to modify the final modes by means of structural modifications. Moreover the methodology, together with the developed finite element model, proves to be valid for studying the dynamic fluid-structure coupling in any arbitrary mechanical system, including cavities connected to the surrounding air. /textcopyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This article reviews the state of researchin XP and AM, and recommends areas that could benefit from furtherstudy. Since nearly all empirical XP research relates to pairprogramming, a closer look into the unstudied XP core practices would bebeneficial, although interaction between related core practice areascould confound such efforts. It might also be possible to group relatedcore XP concepts and study the groups individually.

This paper introduces an information gain technique used in machine learning for data mining to evaluate the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. Neural network models for level estimation and classification are then examined for their ability to provide an effective forecast of future values. A cross-validation technique is also employed to improve the generalization ability of several models. The results show that the trading strategies guided by the classification models generate higher risk-adjusted profits than the buy-and-hold strategy, as well as those guided by the level-estimation based forecasts of the neural network and linear regression models. /textcopyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Our understanding of Nature comes in layers, so should the development of logic. Classic logic is an indispensable part of our knowledge, and its interactions with computer science have recently dramatically changed our life. A new layer of logic has been developing ever since the discovery of quantum mechanics. G. D. Birkhoff and von Neumann introduced quantum logic in a seminal paper in 1936 [1]. But the definition of quantum logic varies among authors (see [2]). How to capture the logic structure inherent in quantum mechanics is very interesting and challenging. Given the close connection between classical logic and theoretical computer science as exemplified by the coincidence of computable functions through Turing machines, recursive function theory, and \$/lambda\$-calculus, we are interested in how to gain some insights about quantum logic from quantum computing. In this note we make some observations about quantum logic as motivated by quantum computing (see [5]) and hope more people will explore this connection.  The quantum logic as envisioned by Birkhoff and von Neumann is based on the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space, usually an infinite dimensional one. The quantum logic of a fixed Hilbert space ℍ in this note is the variety of all the true equations with finitely many variables using the connectives meet, join and negation. Quantum computing is theoretically based on quantum systems with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, especially the states space of a qubit ℂ 2 .

There has been much discussion about the tool and the objects of the tool, but little discussion of the implication of the material process on the digital process. A brief historical review on the development of computer numerical control and the origins of the B/'ezier curve reveals an instrumental fact: computer numerical controlled tools necessitated advancements in computational surfaces which eventually led to NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces. In other words, the origins of NURBS surfaces resides in its relation to material processes, rather than many current approaches that develop free form surfaces and then force the tool onto the material without regard to the material properties. From this historical and mathematical review, this project develops toward more intelligent construction methods based on the integration of NURBS differential geometry paired with material qualities and processes. Specifically, a digital technique of developing conceptual NURBS geometry into piecewise surface patches are then flattened based on the material thickness and density. From these flattened patches, a material technique is developed to intelligently remove material to allow the rigid flat material to re-develop into physical surface patches. The goal of this research is to develop digital and material techniques toward intelligent construction based on the correspondence between digitally driven surface and digitally driven material processes.

Smith and Thierry Voinier`,translator: ` `,abstract: `As is well-known, digital waveguides offer a computationally efficient, and physically motivated means of simulating wave propagation in strings. The method is based on sampling the traveling wave solution to the ideal wave equation and linearly filtering this solution to simulate dispersive effects due to stiffness and frequency-dependent loss; such digital filters may terminate the waveguide or be embedded along its length. For strings of high stiffness, however, dispersion filters can be difficult to design and expensive to implement. In this article, we show how high-quality time-domain terminating filters may be derived from given frequency-domain specifications which depend on the model parameters. Particular attention is paid to the problem of phase approximation, which, in the case of high stiffness, is strongly nonlinear. Finally, in the interest of determining the limits of applicability of digital waveguide techniques, we make a comparison with more conventional finite difference schemes, in terms of computational cost and numerical dispersion, for a set of string stiffness parameters. /textcopyright S.

  {key: `2004_traube`,type: `phdthesis`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Caroline Traube`,abstract: `This dissertation proposes an interdisciplinary approach for the study of the timbre of the classical guitar. We start by identifying the static control parameters of timbre, relating to the structural components of the guitar and the dynamic control parameters of timbre, relating to the gestures applied by the performer on the instrument. From the plucked string physical model (obtained from the tranverse wave equation), we derive a digital signal interpretation of the plucking eﬀect which is a comb ﬁltering. Then we investigate how subjective characteristics of sound, like timbre, are related to gesture parameters. The starting point for exploration is an inventory of verbal descriptors commonly used by professional musicians to describe the brightness, the colour, the shape and the texture of the sounds they produce on their instruments. An explanation for the voice-like nature of guitar tones is proposed based on the observation that the maxima of the comb-ﬁltershaped magnitude spectrum of guitar tones are located at frequencies similar to the formant frequencies of a subset of identiﬁable vowels. These analogies at the spectral level might account for the origin of some timbre descriptors such as open, oval, round, thin, closed, nasal and hollow, that seem to refer to phonetic gestures. In a experiment conducted to conﬁrm these analogies, participants were asked to associate a consonant to the attack and a vowel to the decay of guitar tones. The results of this study support the idea that some perceptual dimensions of the guitar timbre space can be borrowed from phonetics. Finally, we address the problem of the indirect acquisition of instrumental gesture parameters. Pursuing previous research on the estimation of the plucking position from a recording, we propose a new estimation method based on an iterative weighted least-square algorithm, starting from a ﬁrst approximation derived from a variant of the autocorrelation function of the signal.`,institution: `McGill University`,langid: `english`,pages: `237`,title: `An Interdisciplinary Study of the Timbre of the Classical Guitar.`,year: `2004`,tags: `tesse`},

In addition, textiles and clothing has marketcharacteristics, such as short product lifecycle, high volatility, lowpredictability, and a high level of impulse purchase, making such issuesas quick response of Paramount importance. This article discussescharacteristics of the textiles and apparel industry and identifies theperspectives of lean, agile and leagility (a combination of these)within existing supply chain literature, which have been proffered assolutions to achieving quick response and reduced lead times.

Ballal and Joseph Zelina`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Second only to the invention of an airplane by the Wright Brothers 100 years ago, the jet engine has revolutionized both military and civil aviation. We present a survey of the key aeroengine technology trends. Since 1939, engine thrust has increased over 100-fold and the (thrust/weight) ratio to 7. Whereas the early jet engines barely lasted for less than 10 hours, today's civil engines can stay on wings for up to 10,000 hours, and high-performance military engines can last several hundred hours. Advances in blade cooling technologies and high-temperature materials have permitted an increase in turbine inlet temperature from 1280 to 3200°F. Today, engine thermal efficiency is approaching 50%. Also, today's most powerful aeroengines already meet the International Civil Aviation Organization ultra-low gaseous and smoke requirements. Finally, civil and military technology is moving along the direction set by the versatile affordable advanced turbine engines (VAATE) propulsion capability goals. The spectacular achievements of the last century truly provide an outstanding start for many future achievements to come in the field of aeroengine technology, along the lines of the VAATE goals.`,doi: `10.2514/1.562`,issn: `15333868`,journal: `Journal of Aircraft`,number: `1`,pages: `43--50`,title: `Progress in Aeroengine Technology (1939-2003)`,volume: `41`,year: `2004`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2018 MATRIX CAPSULES WITH EM ROUTING - Hinton et al.pdf`},

[Nature (London) 416, 87–90 (2002)] using "auditory chimera" in which the envelope from one sound was paired with the fine structure of another. Smith et al. found that, when 4 to 16 frequency bands were used, recognition of English speech was dominated by the envelope, whereas recognition of melody was dominated by the fine structure. In the present study, Mandarin Chinese monosyllables were divided into 4, 8, or 16 frequency bands and the fine structure and envelope of one tone pattern were exchanged with those of another tone pattern of the same monosyllable. Five normal-hearing native Mandarin Chinese speakers completed a four-alternative forced-choice tone-identification task. In the vast majority of trials, subjects based their identification of the monosyllables on the fine structure rather than the envelope. Thus, the relative importance of envelope and fine structure for lexical-tone perception resembled that for melody recognition rather than that for English speech recognition. Delivering fine-structure information in cochlear implant stimulation could be particularly beneficial for lexical-tone perception.`,doi: `10.1121/1.1623786`,issn: `0001-4966`,journal: `The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America`,number: `6`,pages: `3024--3027`,pmid: `14714781`,title: `Relative importance of temporal envelope and fine structure in lexical-tone perception (L)`,volume: `114`,year: `2003`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/unused/xu2003.pdf`,tags: `speech,temporal envelope`},

Thus, repeat measurements of in situ surface and subsurface repellency and associated soil moisture content were made on eight occasions over a 16-month period at four sites in Eucalyptus globulus plantations of differing stand age (1-10 years) and burn history in north-central Portugal. Key findings are: (a) at all sites, large-scale seasonal variations in repellency occur, which, for the surface soils of the 10-year old site, encompass the transition from entirely wettable to entirely repellent within a period of ≤2 months; (b) when soils are either mostly wettable or mostly repellent, a close inverse relationship with antecedent rainfall and soil moisture exists; however, (c) at other times, no clear relationship between antecedent rainfall and soil moisture is apparent; and (d) the area of soil affected by repellency increases with stand age. The implications of these findings for slope hydrology are discussed.`,issn: `01447815`,journal: `IAHS-AISH Publication`,keywords: `Eucalyptus globulus,Overland flow,Portugal,Slope hydrology,Soil moisture,Spatial patterns,Temporal patterns,Water repellency`,number: `278`,pages: `111--116`,title: `Spatio-temporal patterns of soil water repellency in Portuguese eucalyptus forests and implications for slope hydrology`,year: `2003`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/2011 D³ Data-Driven Documents - Bostock et al.pdf`},

Risk management has rapidly evolved over the last decade and has become an indis- pensable function in many institutions. This Handbook was originally written to provide support for candidates taking the FRM examination administered by GARP. As such, it reviews a wide variety of prac- tical topics in a consistent and systematic fashion. It covers quantitative methods, capital markets, as well as market, credit, operational, and integrated risk manage- ment. It also discusses the latest regulatory, legal, and accounting issues essential to risk professionals. Modern risk management systems cut across the entire organization. This breadth is reflected in the subjects covered in this Handbook. This Handbook was designed to be self-contained, but only for readers who already have some exposure to financial markets. To reap maximum benefit from this book, readers should have taken the equivalent of an MBA-level class on investments. Finally, I wanted to acknowledge the help received in the writing of this second ed- ition. In particular, I would like to thank the numerous readers who shared comments on the previous edition. Any comment and suggestion for improvement will be wel- come.

However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The rain-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.`,doi: `10.1109/TSP.2002.807005`,issn: `1053587X`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing`,keywords: `Discrete Fourier transform,Gridding,Imaging,Magnetic resonance,Min-max interpolation,Tomography`,number: `2`,pages: `560--574`,title: `Nonuniform fast Fourier transforms using min-max interpolation`,volume: `51`,year: `2003`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Harmonic Analysis/Fourier Transform/2003 Nonuniform fast fourier transforms using min-max interpolation - Fessler and Sutton.pdf`},

The model involves the transverse displacement of the string excited by a force pulse, the flexural motion of the soundboard, and the sound radiation. A specific spectral method is used for solving the Kirchhoff-Love's dynamic top plate model for a damped, heterogeneous orthotropic material. The air-plate interaction is solved with a fictitious domain method, and a conservative scheme is used for the time discretization. Frequency analysis is performed on the simulated sound pressure and plate velocity waveforms in order to evaluate quantitatively the transfer of energy through the various components of the coupled system: from the string to the soundboard and from the soundboard to the air. The effects of some structural changes in soundboard thickness and cavity volume on the produced sounds are presented and discussed. Simulations of the same guitar in three different cases are also performed: "in vacuo," in air with a perfectly rigid top plate, and in air with an elastic top plate. This allows comparisons between structural, acoustic, and structural-acoustic modes of the instrument. Finally, attention is paid to the evolution with time of the spatial pressure field. This shows, in particular, the complex evolution of the directivity pattern in the near field of the instrument, especially during the attack.`,doi: `10.1121/1.1629302`,issn: `0001-4966`,journal: `The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America`,number: `6`,pages: `3368--3383`,pmid: `14714817`,title: `Time-domain simulation of a guitar: Model and method`,volume: `114`,year: `2003`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Guitar/2003 time-domain simulation of a guitar - derveaux et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged,#corrupted author`},

The core theme of this paper is that, in spite ofthe increasing attention given to manufacturing strategy from theseminal work of Skinner through to the plethora of articles in recenttimes, little is mentioned about its application to paradigms of agilityor mass customisation. As a consequence firms attempt to become agileand to pursue mass customisation without appreciating the contributionof plant-specific manufacturing strategies that might enable them toachieve these aspirations. We examine the enablers and strategicblockages in pursuing mass customisation, via a mapping process, andreveal reasons why some firms remain unable to devise and implementmanufacturing strategies.`,address: `HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND`,doi: `10.1108/01443570310481522`,issn: `0144-3577`,journal: `INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT`,keywords: `strategic planning; mass customization; agile prod`,number: `7-8`,pages: `707--730`,publisher: `EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD`,title: `The manufacturing strategy-capabilities links in mass customisation and agile manufacturing - an exploratory study`,volume: `23`,year: `2003`},
  {key: `2003_bonada_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Jordi Bonada and Alex Loscos and H Kenmochi`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `The singing synthesis system we present generates a performance of an artificial singer out of the musical score and the phonetic transcription of a song using a frame-based frequency domain technique. This performance mimics the real singing of a singer that has been previously recorded, analyzed and stored in a database, in which we store his voice characteristics (phonetics) and his low-level expressivity (attacks, releases, note transitions and vibratos). To synthesize such performance the systems concatenates a set of elemental synthesis units (phonetic articulations and stationeries). These units are obtained by transposing and time-scaling the database samples. The concatenation of these transformed samples is performed by spreading out the spectral shape and phase discontinuities of the boundaries along a set of transition frames that surround the joint frames. The expression of the singing is applied through a Voice Model built up on top of a Spectral Peak Processing (SPP) technique. SPP considers the spectrum as a set of regions. Each region is made up of one spectral peak and its surroundings and can be shifted both in frequency and amplitude. The Voice Model is based on an improved version of the traditional excitation/filter approach. The system will be demonstrated with several performances.`,journal: `Proceedings of Stockholm Music /ldots`,number: `Smac 03`,pages: `1--4`,title: `Sample-based singing voice synthesizer by spectral concatenation`,url: `http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&btnG=Search&q=intitle:Sample-based+singing+voice+synthesizer+by+spectral+concatenation#0`,volume: `2003`,year: `2003`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Acoustics/Voice Synthesis/Sample-based singing voice synthesizer by spectral concatenation.pdf`},

  {reviewed: true,key: `2003_bensa_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Julien Bensa and Stefan Bilbao and Richard Kronl and  -Martinet and Julius O. Smith III`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `A model of transverse piano string vibration, second order in time, which models frequency-dependent loss and dispersion effects is presented here. This model has many desirable properties, in particular that it can be written as a well-posed initial-boundary value problem (permitting stable finite difference schemes) and that it may be directly related to a digital waveguide model, a digital filter-based algorithm which can be used for musical sound synthesis. Techniques for the extraction of model parameters from experimental data over the full range of the grand piano are discussed, as is the link between the model parameters and the filter responses in a digital waveguide. Simulations are performed. Finally, the waveguide model is extended to the case of several coupled strings.`,doi: `10.1121/1.1587146`,journal: `The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America`,keywords: `digital waveguides, physical modeling, finite difference`,number: `2`,pages: `1095--1107`,pmid: `12942987`,publisher: `ASA`,title: `The simulation of piano string vibration: From physical models to finite difference schemes and digital waveguides`,volume: `114`,year: `2003`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Digital Waveguides/2003 the simulation of piano string vibration - bensa et al.pdf`,tags: `piano,digital musical instruments`},

Whereas performance enhancements of lean practices have beendemonstrated, it is now the case that markets have become increasinglycharacterized by turbulence, a situation in which reliance on leanpractices is insufficient, and that survival requires adoption of agilepractices. As a result, a comparative study of lean and agilemanufacturing with a related survey of current practices in the UK wascarried out, the results of which is presented in this paper. The paperexplored the threats to lean and the drivers of agile manufacturing.Using data from a questionnaire survey, four hypotheses were tested,which was indicative of the benefits of agile manufacturing. In contrastto their lean counterparts, agile companies paid attention to a widerrange of competitive capabilities. They therefore had a lower range ofmean scores on competitive capabilities. Independent sample tests ofsignificant difference in business performance measures revealed thatthe agile companies consistently outperformed their lean competitors onall business performance measures studied. In addition, a wider range ofcompetitive capabilities and performance measures of the agile companiescorrelated significantly and positively whilst such correlation wasobserved for only a narrow range of capabilities and performancemeasures for lean companies. The results suggest that competingsimultaneously on multiple competitive capabilities enhance performancebetter than a rather narrow focus on cost and quality.`,address: `4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK,, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND`,doi: `10.1080/00207540210157141`,issn: `0020-7543`,journal: `INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH`,month: `nov`,number: `17`,pages: `4545--4562`,publisher: `TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD`,title: `A comparative study of lean and agile manufacturing with a related survey of current practices in the UK`,volume: `40`,year: `2002`},

The presence of massive feedback connections within this hierarchy raises the possibility that normal visual processing relies on the use of computational loops. It is not known, however, whether object recognition can be performed at all without such loops (i.e., in a purely feed-forward mode). By analyzing the time course of reaction times in a masked natural scene categorization paradigm, we show that the human visual system can generate selective motor responses based on a single feed-forward pass. We confirm these results using a more constrained letter discrimination task, in which the rapid succession of a target and mask is actually perceived as a distractor. We show that a masked stimulus presented for only 26 msecand often not consciously perceivedcan fully determine the earliest selective motor responses: The neural representations of the stimulus and mask are thus kept separated during a short period corresponding to the feedforward sweep. Therefore, feedback loops do not appear to be mandatory for visual processing. Rather, we found that such loops allow the masked stimulus to reverberate in the visual system and affect behavior for nearly 150 msec after the feed-forward sweep.`,archiveprefix: `arXiv`,arxivid: `1407.0576`,doi: `10.1162/106365602320169811`,eprint: `1407.0576`,isbn: `10636560`,issn: `1063-6560`,journal: `Evolutionary Computation`,keywords: `evolutive`,number: `2`,pages: `99--127`,pmid: `12180173`,publisher: `MIT Press`,title: `Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies`,url: `http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/106365602320169811`,volume: `10`,year: `2002`,tags: `#merged,evolutive`},

By embedding biofibers with renewable resource-based biopolymers such as cellulosic plastics; polylactides; starch plastics; polyhydroxyalkanoates (bacterial polyesters); and soy-based plastics, the so-called green bio-composites are continuously being developed. /textcopyright2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.`,doi: `10.1023/A:1021013921916`,issn: `15662543`,journal: `Journal of Polymers and the Environment`,keywords: `Bioplastic,Cellulosic plastic,Fiber-matrix interface,Natural fiber,Polyhydroxyalkanoates,Polylactides,Soybean-based plastic,Sustamable bio-composites`,number: `1-2`,pages: `19--26`,title: `Sustainable Bio-Composites from renewable resources: Opportunities and challenges in the green materials world`,volume: `10`,year: `2002`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/Environment/2002 sustainable bio-composites from renewable resources - mohanty et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

  {key: `2002_lyche_etal`,type: `article`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,author: `Tom Lyche and Knut Morken`,abstract: `In this first chapter we consider the following fundamental problem: Given a set of points in the plane, determine a smooth curve that approximates the points. The algorithm for determining the curve from the points should be well suited for implementation on a computer. That is, it should be efficient and it should not be overly sensitive to roundoff errors in the computations. We only consider methods that involve a relatively small number of elementary arithmetic operations; this ensures that the methods are efficient. The sensitivity of the methods to round-off errors is controlled by insisting that all the operations involved should amount to forming weighted averages of the given points. This has the added advantage that the constructions are geometrical in nature and easy to visualise. In Section 1.1 we discuss affine and convex combinations and the convex hull of a set of points, and relate these concepts to numerical stability (sensitivity to rounding errors), while in Section 1.2 we give a brief and very informal introduction to parametric curves. The first method for curve construction, namely polynomial interpolation, is introduced in Section 1.3. In Section 1.4 we show how to construct Bezier curves, and in Section 1.5 we generalise this construction to spline curves. At the outset, our construction of spline curves is geometrical in nature, but in Section 1.6 we show that spline curves can be written conveniently in terms of certain basis functions, namely B-splines. In the final section, we relate the material in this chapter to the rest of the book.`,keywords: `Approximation Theory,Arc Length,B-splines,Bezier Curves,Convex Hull,Knot Insertion,Linear Algebra,Marsden's Identity,Quadratic Interpolation,Splines,Tensor Product,quasi-interpolant`,pages: `36`,title: `Spline Methods`,year: `2002`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Computer Graphics/2008 Spline Methods.pdf - Tom Lyche et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

This kind of satellites ispresently studied by the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales(PLEIADES project). The mission of an Earth Observing Satellite is toacquire images of specified areas on the Earth surface, in response toobservation requests from customers. Whereas non-agile satellites suchas SPOT5 have only one degree of freedom for acquiring images, the newgeneration satellites have three, giving opportunities for a moreefficient use of the satellite imaging capabilities. Counterwise to thisadvantage, the selection and scheduling of observations becomessignificantly more difficult, due to the larger search space forpotential solutions. Hence, selecting and scheduling observations ofagile satellites is a highly combinatorial problem. This article setsout the overall problem and analyses its difficulties. Then it presentsdifferent methods which have been investigated in order to solve asimplified version of the complete problem: a greedy algorithm, adynamic programming algorithm, a constraint programming approach and alocal search method.

The rectilinear 3D extension to the mesh had been suggested, and has been applied to the case of room acoustics. However, it requires the use of 6-port scattering junctions, which make a multiply-free implementation impossible in the isotropic case. The 4-port scattering junctions of the 2D mesh required only an internal divide by 2, which could be implemented as a right shift in binary arithmetic. However, the 6-port junction requires a divide by 3. The multiply-free cases occur for N-port junctions in which N is a power of two. We propose here a tetrahedral distribution of multiply-free 4-port scattering junctions filling space much like the molecular structure of the diamond crystal, where the placement of the scattering junctions corresponds to the placement of the carbon nuclei, and the bi-directional delay units correspond to the four tetrahedrally spaced single bonds between each pair of nuclei. We show that the tetrahedral mesh is mathematically equivalent to a finite difference scheme (FDS) which approximates the 3D lossless wave equation.

However, the increasing computational power of the modern processors makes it feasible to experiment with more complex algorithms also for real-time sound synthesis purposes. By certain simplifications, time-domain methods based on finite differences (FDTD) are efficient enough to run in real time on modern processors and yet they are more flexible than the computationally less expensive commuted synthesis. The resulting structures, which are called 1-D FDTD waveguides, have previously been shown to be equal to or to approximate many properties of digital waveguides, including lossless and lossy propagation, input and output ports, terminations, and scattering junctions. The numerical stability of the 1-D FDTD waveguides, as well as their initialization and formation of the traveling waves are well understood. However, a careful comparison between 1-D FDTD waveguides and conventional digital waveguides in terms of their limitations, computational efficiency, accuracy, and interaction has not been carried out. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by highlighting important properties of both methods side by side in string instrument modeling and synthesis. We then try to combine the best properties of both methods and discuss the interaction of the two model structures.

Taking a computational approach, Temperley develops models for generating these aspects of musical structure. The models he proposes are based on preference rules, which are criteria for evaluating a possible structural analysis of a piece of music. A preference rule system evaluates many possible interpretations and chooses the one that best satisfies the rules. After an introductory chapter, Temperley presents preference rule systems for generating six basic kinds of musical structure: meter, phrase structure, contrapuntal structure, harmony, and key, as well as pitch spelling (the labeling of pitch events with spellings such as A flat or G sharp). He suggests that preference rule systems not only show how musical structures are inferred, but also shed light on other aspects of music. He substantiates this claim with discussions of musical ambiguity, retrospective revision, expectation, and music outside the Western canon (rock and traditional African music). He proposes a framework for the description of musical styles based on preference rule systems and explores the relevance of preference rule systems to higher-level aspects of music, such as musical schemata, narrative and drama, and musical tension.`,doi: `10.1353/not.2002.0116`,isbn: `0262201348`,issn: `1534-150X`,journal: `Notes`,number: `1`,pages: `97--99`,title: `The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures (review)`,volume: `59`,year: `2002`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Music/2001 The cognition of basic musical structures - Temperley.pdf`},

Each of the two algorithms has its own advantages and is to be purposefully applied to a specific fitting task, considering the implementation and memory space cost, and possibilities of observation weighting. By the new algorithms, the model feature parameters are grouped and simultaneously estimated in terms of form, position, and rotation parameters. The form parameters determine the shape of the model feature and the position/rotation parameters describe the rigid body motion of the model feature. The proposed algorithms are applicable to any kind of implicit surface and plane curve.

By introducing new genetic operators to the improved GA, it will also be shown that the improved GA performs better than the traditional GA based on some benchmark test functions. A neural network with switches introduced to links is proposed. By doing this, the proposed neural network can learn both the input-output relationships of an application and the network structure. Using the improved GA, the structure and the parameters of the neural network can be tuned.

An increased number of both CD4+ and CD8+ naive T cells and a normalization of the frequency of CCR5- and CXCR4-expressing CD4+ T cells were readily observed after starting therapy. Single cell analysis of cytokine production after 12 months of HAART showed an increased number of interleukin (IL)-2-, but not IL-4- and (IFN)-\$/gamma\$-, producing T cells and a decreased percentage of CD8+ IFN-\$/gamma\$ + cells. A correlation between the frequency of IFN-\$/gamma\$-producing T cells and that of memory, CCR5+ and CD95+ T cells was demonstrated in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. The diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) variable beta (BV) chain repertoire significantly increased after 12 months of HAART within the CD4+ but not the CD8+ T cell subset. However, the level of perturbation of the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3), was not significantly modified by effective therapy. The number of anti-HIV Gag and Pol cytotoxic T lymphocytes precursors (CTLp) decreased during HAART and highly correlated with the CD8 IFN-\$/gamma\$ response. Ameliorated clinical conditions were observed in all patients in absence of any opportunistic infections during all the study period. These observations indicate that a better restoration of immunity may be obtained in patients starting HAART at less advanced stages of the disease.`,doi: `10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01502.x`,isbn: `1002620262`,issn: `00099104`,journal: `Clinical and Experimental Immunology`,keywords: `CTL,Cytokine,HAART,HIV,TCR,theory`,number: `1`,pages: `21--31`,pmid: `11359439`,title: `T cell responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy defined by chemokine receptors expression, cytokine production, T cell receptor repertoire and anti-HIV T-lymphocyte activity`,volume: `124`,year: `2001`,tags: `theory,#merged`},

Past approaches to this problem tend to confuse gradual shot changes with changes caused by smooth camera motions. This is in part due to the fact that camera motion has not been dealt with in a more fundamental way. We propose an approach that is based on a physical constraint used in optical flow analysis, namely, the total brightness of a scene point across two frames should remain constant if the change across two frames is a result of smooth camera motion. Since the brightness constraint would be violated across a shot change, the detection can be based on detecting the violation of this constraint. It is robust because it uses only the qualitative aspect of the brightness constraint - detecting a scene change rather than estimating the scene itself. Moreover, by tapping on the significant know-how in using this constraint, the algorithm's robustness is further enhanced. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of various algorithms. It was shown that our algorithm is less likely to interpret gradual camera motions as shot changes, resulting in a significantly better precision performance than most other algorithms.`,doi: `10.1023/A:1011351316971`,isbn: `9780137024971`,issn: `13807501`,journal: `Multimedia Tools and Applications`,keywords: `Optical flow,Shot change detection,Video segmentation`,number: `2`,pages: `175--186`,title: `Shot change detection using scene-based constraint`,volume: `14`,year: `2001`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/2012 Management accounting information for decision-making and strategy execution - Atkinson.pdf`},

Without it, a number of consumer and commercial products, such as DVD, videophone, digital camera, MP3, video-streaming and wireless PCS, would have been virtually impossible. Transforming the data to a frequency or other domain enables even more efficient compression. By illustrating this intimate link, The Transform and Data Compression Handbook serves as a much-needed handbook for a wide range of researchers and engineers. The authors describe various discrete transforms and their applications in different disciplines. They cover techniques, such as adaptive quantization and entropy coding, that result in significant reduction in bit rates when applied to the transform coefficients. With clear and concise presentations of the ideas and concepts, as well as detailed descriptions of the algorithms, the authors provide important insight into the applications and their limitations. Data compression is an essential step towards the efficient storage and transmission of information.

Prior approaches to encoding higher order functions in C++ have suffered with respect to polymorphic functions from either lack of expressiveness or high complexity. In contrast, FC++ offers full and concise support for higher-order polymorphic functions through a novel use of C++ type inference. Another new element in FC++ is that it implements a subtype polymorphism policy for functions, in addition to the more common parametric polymorphism facilities. Subtype polymorphism is common in object oriented languages and ensures that functions in FC++ fit well within the C++ object model. Apart from these conceptual differences, FC++ is also an improvement in technical terms over previous efforts in the literature. Our function objects are reference-counted and can be aliased without needing to be copied, resulting in an efficient implementation. The reference-counting mechanism is also exported to the user as a general-purpose replacement of native C++ pointers. Finally, we supply a number of useful functional operators (a large part of the Haskell Standard Prelude) to facilitate programming with FC++. The end result is a library that is usable and efficient, while requiring no extensions to the base C++ language.`,doi: `10.1145/351240.351251`,isbn: `1581132026`,journal: `Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming, ICFP`,pages: `118--129`,title: `Functional programming in C++`,year: `2000`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/programming/C++/Functional Programming in C++ - McNamara and Smaragdakis.pdf`},

  {key: `2000_fischer`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `K Fischer`,abstract: `Assume we are given a set S ⊂ Rd of n points in 2D or 3D and we want to have something like "the shape formed by these points." This is quite a vague notion and there are probably many possible interpretations (cf. [3]), the \$/alpha\$-shape being one of them. As mentionned in Edelsbrunner's and M¨ ucke's paper [3], one can intuitively think of an \$/alpha\$-shape as the following. Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space Rd and containing the points S as "hard" chocolate pieces. Using one of these sphere-formed ice-cream spoons we carve out all parts of the ice- cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (eg. parts not reachable by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and points. If we now straighten all "round" faces to triangles and line segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the \$/alpha\$-shape of S. Here's an example for this process in 2D (where our ice-cream spoon is simply a circle): And what is \$/alpha\$ in the game? \$/alpha\$ is the radius of the carving spoon. A very small value will allow us to eat up all of the ice-cream except the chocolate points S themselves. Thus we already see that the \$/alpha\$-shape of S degenerates to the point-set S for \$/alpha\$ → 0. On the other hand, a huge value of \$/alpha\$ will prevent us even from moving the spoon between two points since it's way too large. So we will never spoon up ice-cream lying in the inside of the convex hull of S, and hence the \$/alpha\$-shape for \$/alpha\$→∞ is the convex hull of S. In the following I will (i) summarize the definitons from [3] to state the above concepts (spoon, etc.) more precisely and (ii) present a result from [1] which allows one to easily compute \$/alpha\$-shapes from the Delaunay triangulation of S. Finally, I will very briefly give an overview of the problems and approaches with \$/alpha\$-shapes when applied to surface reconstruction. 2`,journal: `Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University`,pages: `1--17`,title: `Introduction to Alpha Shapes`,url: `http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&btnG=Search&q=intitle:Introduction+to+Alpha+Shapes#1`,year: `2000`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/Introduction to Alpha Shapes - Fischer.pdf`},

Companies now have to be able to notonly predict variations and changes within the market and socio-economicand political environments but must also be able to adapt and change inaccordance with these environments. As a result, this demands that anorganisation develops and sustains an inherent ability to continuouslychange. Such a demand can be met by adopting the management philosophyof agile manufacturing. Tn embracing such an approach, there are a lotof key concepts and enabling technologies that are required to be ableto implement agile manufacturing and many companies do not know how fardown the path they are towards becoming agile manufacturingorganisations. Hence, in providing a deeper understanding, this paperproposes a conceptual model, based on joint research, which has beendeveloped to identify where UK's best practice companies are in theirquest to become agile manufacturing organisations. In support of this, aquestionnaire has been developed and completed by best practitioners ofmanufacturing, to assess the model, and establish whether they aremaking progress to becoming agile manufacturing organisations.

The best basis search is performed in families of orthonormal bases constructed with wavelet packets or local cosine bases. We base our search for the best' basis on a criterion of minimal reconstruction error of the underlying signal. This approach is intuitively appealing because the enhanced or estimated signal has an associated measure of performance, namely, the resulting mean-square error. Previous approaches in this framework have focused on obtaining the most compact' signal representations, which consequently contribute to effective denoising. These approaches, however, do not possess the inherent measure of performance which our algorithm provides. We first propose an estimator of the mean-square error, based on a heuristic argument and subsequently compare the reconstruction performance based upon it to that based on the Stein unbiased risk estimator. We compare the two proposed estimators by providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bias term. Having two estimators of the mean-square error, we incorporate these cost functions into the search for the best' basis, and subsequently provide a substantiating example to demonstrate their performance.`,doi: `10.1109/18.796365`,issn: `00189448`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Information Theory`,number: `7`,pages: `2225--2238`,title: `On denoising and best signal representation`,volume: `45`,year: `1999`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/allocate/1999 On denoising and best signal representation - Krim et al..pdf`},

This process often involves solving sim-ilar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under stringent time requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this solution process to directly learn the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need of solving computationally expensive large-scale paramet-ric programs in real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active con-straints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables more interpretable learning poli-cies, and inherently accounts for relevant safety constraints. Further, the number of relevant ac-tive sets is finite, which make them simpler ob-jects to learn. To learn the relevant active sets, we propose a streaming algorithm backed up by the-oretical results. Through extensive experiments on benchmarks of the Optimal Power Flow prob-lem, we observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that this is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning al-gorithm to target.`,doi: `10.1201/9781420049503-c34`,isbn: `9780521833783`,title: `Convex Optimization`,year: `1998`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Optimization/2004 Convex Optimization - Boyd, Stephen P. and Vandenberghe, Lieven.pdf`},

The filter bank structure adapts according to psychoacoustic criteria and according to the computational complexity that is available at the decoder. This permits software implementations that can perform according to the computational power available in order to achieve real time coding/decoding. The bit allocation scheme is an adapted zero-tree algorithm that also takes input from the psychoacoustic model. The measure of performance is a quantity called subband perceptual rate, which the filter bank structure adapts to approach the perceptual entropy (PE) as closely as possible. In addition, this method is also amenable to progressive transmission, that is, it can achieve the best quality of reconstruction possible considering the size of the bit stream available at the encoder. The result is a variablerate compression scheme for high-quality audio that takes into account the allowed computational complexity, the available bitbudget, and the psychoacoustic criteria for transparent coding. This paper thus provides a novel scheme to marry the results in wavelet packets and perceptual coding to construct an algorithm that is well suited to high-quality audio transfer for internet and storage applications. /textcopyright 1998 IEEE.`,doi: `10.1109/78.668558`,issn: `1053587X`,journal: `IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing`,keywords: `Audio compression,Wavelet applications,Wavelet packets,Zero trees`,number: `4`,pages: `1085--1093`,title: `High-quality audio compression using an adaptive wavelet packet decomposition and psychoacoustic modeling`,volume: `46`,year: `1998`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/1998 High-quality audio compression using an adaptive wavelet packet decomposition and psychoacoustic modeling - Srinivasan and Jamieson.pdf`},

This paper discusses the various technologies being used to produce polylactic acids. In addition, attention is drawn to how monomer stereochemistry can be controlled to impart targeted utility in the final polymers. Specific applications are described to illustrate further the range of properties that can be developed by utilising both the basic monomer/polymer chemistries in combination with post-modification techniques.

Snin and Quanan Zheng and Nai Chyuan Yen and Chi Chao Tung and Henry H. Liu`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the 'empirical mode decomposition' method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of 'intrinsic mode functions' that admit well-behaved Hubert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hubert transform, the 'instrinic mode functions' yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hubert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of 'intrinsic mode functions' based on local properties of the signal, which makes the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data, are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution /textcopyright 1998 The Royal Society.`,doi: `10.1098/rspa.1998.0193`,issn: `13645021`,journal: `Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences`,keywords: `Empirical mode decomposition,Frequency-time spectrum,Hubert spectral analysis,Intrinsic time scale,Non-stationary time series,Nonlinear differential equations`,number: `1971`,pages: `903--995`,title: `The empirical mode decomposition and the Hubert spectrum for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis`,volume: `454`,year: `1998`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/envelope/1998 The empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert spectrum for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis - Huang et al..pdf`},

As the product life cycle becomes shortened, highproduct quality becomes necessary for survival. Markets become highlydiversified and global, and continuous and unexpected change become thekey factors for success. The need for a method of rapidly andcost-effectively developing products, production facilities andsupporting software, including design, process planning and shop floorcontrol system has led to the concept of agile manufacturing.Agile manufacturing can be defined as the capability to survive andprosper in a competitive environment of continuous and unpredictablechange by reacting quickly and effectively to changing markets, drivenby customer-designed products and services. This article details the keyconcepts and enablers of agile manufacturing. The key enablers of agilemanufacturing include: (i) virtual enterprise formation tools/metrics;(ii) physically distributed manufacturing architecture and teams; (iii)rapid partnership formation tools/metrics; (iv) concurrent engineering;(v) integrated product/production/business information system; (vi)rapid prototyping tools; and (vii) electronic commerce.

  {key: `1998_guitouni_etal1`,type: `article`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,author: `Adel Guitouni and Jean Marc Martel`,abstract: `Despite the development of a large number of refined multicriterion decision aid (MCDA) methods, none can be considered as the 'super method' appropriate to all decision making situations. Hence, how can one choose an appropriate method to a specific decision situation? Recent experimental studies in psychology and behaviour have revealed, on the one hand, that the human thinking is not to be modelled by logical rules and calculations, and, on the other hand, that the response mode affects the preference formation as well as the use of compensatory or noncompensatory strategies. The aim of this paper is to draw a conceptual framework for articulating tentative guidelines to choose an appropriate MCDA method. This paper also presents the results of the comparison of well known multicriterion aggregation procedures (MCAP) on the basis of these guidelines. In our opinion this study can constitute a first step for proposing a methodological approach to select an appropriate MCDA method to a specific decision making situation. Such an approach should be validated and may be integrated into a decision support system. Moreover, the framework suggested is helpful to develop useful methods and to address neglected issues within the field. /textcopyright1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

As well as providing a wide coverage of existing methodologies the authors also analyse both current areas of research and future trends. In addition the text is supported by introductory material on digital signal processing. Aimed at researchers in signal processing, at communications industries and at music companies and media libraries wishing to remarket or use archive sound recordings, this is a unique and essential study of audio restoration techniques.`,isbn: `9783540762225`,pages: `143--146`,title: `Digital Audio Restoration - a statistical model based approach`,url: `http://books.google.de/books?id=NC1TAAAAMAAJ`,year: `1998`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/Digital Audio Restoration - a statistical model based approach - Godsill and Rayner.pdf`},

More specifically, the aim of what follows is to trace the formative history of a central idea in economic theory: the concept of economic or social ‘surplus' as a fundamental determinant of a range of economic phenomena, especially income distribution and commodity exchange values. This conception of surplus as a basic organizing principle for economic analysis belongs to the history of ideas—not only in the obvious sense, as a creature of human invention or discovery, but also in the sense that during the latter half of the nineteenth century it was replaced as the dominant framework for theorizing economic phenomena in general and income distribution in particular, by the marginalist theories of Jevons (1871), Marshall (1890), Menger (1871) and Walras (1874; 1877), notwithstanding precursors. The tradition of surplus analysis persisted as a living theory only in the thought of Marx and the more or less incoherent forms a residual classicism took in post-Marxian Marxism. A rigorous and coherent reconstruction of the surplus approach, at least with regard to income distribution and values, only fully emerges in Piero Sraffa's Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities: prelude to a critique of economic theory (1960)—notwithstanding, as almost always, the existence of some notable precursors. This study is designed to restore an understanding of the early history of this tradition—a history which was largely ‘submerged and forgotten' (Sraffa 1960:v) as a result of the success of the marginalist theories which remained dominant until Keynes, and indeed beyond. 1.1`,doi: `10.1177/030981689806400114`,isbn: `0415128781`,issn: `0309-8168`,journal: `Capital & Class`,number: `1`,pages: `142--143`,title: `On the Origins of Classical Economics: Distribution and Value from William Petty to Adam Smith`,volume: `22`,year: `1998`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Economics/1995 On the Origins of Classical Economics_ Distribution and Value From William Petty to Adam Smith - Tony Aspromourgos.pdf`},

They face the twin challenges of discriminating between species to identify conspecific mates, and between individuals to recognize collaborators and competitors. It is therefore often assumed that long-distance signals are under strong selection for species-specificity and individual distinctiveness, and that this will drive character displacement when closely related species meet, particularly in noisy environments. However, the occurrence of signal stereotypy and convergence in rainforest species seems to contradict these ideas, and raises the question of whether receivers in these systems can recognize species or individuals by long-distance signals alone. Here, we test for acoustically mediated recognition in two sympatric antbird species that are known to have convergent songs.We show that male songs are stereotyped yet individually distinctive, and we use playback experiments to demonstrate that females can discriminate not only between conspecific and heterospecific males, but between mates and strangers. These findings provide clear evidence that stereotypy and convergence in male signals can be accommodated by fine tuning of perceptual abilities in female receivers, suggesting that the evolutionary forces driving divergent character displacement in animal signals are weaker than is typically assumed.`,isbn: `8535109161`,journal: `Os Economitas: Max Weber`,keywords: `Max Weber,ci/^encias sociais,metologia weberiana,pensamento weberiano`,pages: `192`,title: `Os Economistas`,year: `1997`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Economics/Os Economistas/Max Weber - Textos Selecionados .pdf`},

An architecture combining time-delay windows and recurrent connections is used to capture the important dynamic information of the speech signal. Because the number of connections in a fully connected recurrent network grows super-linear with the number of hidden units, schemes for sparse connection and connection pruning are explored. It is found that sparsely connected networks outperform their fully connected counterparts with an equal number of connections. The implementation of the combined architecture and training scheme is described in detail. The networks are evaluated in a hybrid HMM/ANN system for phoneme recognition on the TIMIT database, and for word recognition on the WAXHOLM database. The achieved phone error-rate, 27.8%, for the standard 39 phoneme set on the core test-set of the TIMIT database is in the range of the lowest reported.

Granular potato starch was plasticized with different amounts of glycerol and water by extrusion. The materials were amorphous directly after processing. During aging above the glass transition temperature at various humidities single helical (V and E-type) and double helical (B-type) crystallinity was formed. The rate of crystallization is a function of water and glycerol content. The amorphous rubbery materials were soft and weak with high elongations. During aging the materials became less flexible with higher elastic modulus and tensile stress. The changes are related to changes in water content and glass transition temperature and to changes in B-type crystallinity. The changes in stress-strain properties are explained by the formation of helical structures and crystals, which results in a reinforcement of the starch network by physical crosslinking. /textcopyright 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.`,doi: `10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19970516)64:7<1411::AID-APP21>3.0.CO;2-Y`,issn: `00218995`,journal: `Journal of Applied Polymer Science`,keywords: `Bioplastic,Crystallinity,Extrusion,Mechanical properties,Potato starch`,number: `7`,pages: `1411--1422`,title: `Influence of glycerol and water content on the structure and properties of extruded starch plastic sheets during aging`,volume: `64`,year: `1997`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Sustentabilidade/1997 influence of glycerol and water content on the structure and properties of - van soest et al.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

The popularity of PCs led to investments in increasingly more powerful MPUs and memory chips of ever-growing capacity. MPUs and DRAMs became the semiconductor industry technology drivers for the data processing needs of the PC. But now, DSP, as opposed to conventional data processing, has become the major technology driver for the semiconductor industry as evidenced by its market growth and the fervour of chip vendors to provide new products based on DSP technology. The increasing need to digitally process analog information signals, like audio and video, is causing a major shift in the semiconductor business.

The systematic musicology approach emphasizes the utility of complex computer simulations, and this study focuses on the self-organization of memory structures and the role of contextual information in guiding perception.

  {key: `1997_maass`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Wolfgang Maass`,abstract: `The computational power of formal models for networks of spiking neurons is compared with that of other neural network models based on McCulloch Pitts neurons (i.e., threshold gates), respectively, sigmoidal gates. In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology.`,doi: `10.1016/S0893-6080(97)00011-7`,issn: `08936080`,journal: `Neural Networks`,keywords: `Computational complexity,Integrate-and-fire neutron,Lower bounds,Sigmoidal neural nets,Spiking neuron`,number: `9`,pages: `1659--1671`,title: `Networks of spiking neurons: The third generation of neural network models`,volume: `10`,year: `1997`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Spiking Neural Networks/1997 Networks of Spiking Neurons The Third Generation of Neural Network Models.pdf`},

  {key: `1996_wood`,type: `book`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,author: `Isaac K Wood`,abstract: `Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

The basic idea is to imitate the sound production mechanism of an acoustic musical instrument using a computer program. The sound produced by such a model will automatically resemble that of the real instrument, if the model has been devised in a proper way. In this article we review the history and present techniques of physical modelling. It appears that the many seemingly very different modelling methods try to achieve the same result: to simulate the solutions of the wave equation in a simplified manner. We concentrate on the digital waveguide modelling technique which has gained much popularity among both researchers and engineers in the music technology industry. The benefits and drawbacks of the new technology are considered, and concurrent research topics are discussed. The physical modelling approach offers many new applications, especially in the fields of multimedia and virtual reality. /textcopyright1996, Cambridge University Press.

  {key: `1996_s_etal2`,type: `article`,author: ` S and Tuomas W. holm and Robert H. Crites`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the idea that the tendency to produce an action should be strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favourable results, and weakened if it produces unfavourable results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that does not need a model of its environment and can be used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL research has been confined to single-agent settings or to multiagent settings where the agents have totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither totally positively nor totally negatively correlated. RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain. This paper investigates the ability of a variety of Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an unknown opponent.

Loughlin and Berkant Tacer`,editor: ` `,abstract: `In general, the problem of determining the amplitude and frequency modulations (AM and FM) of a signal is ill posed because there is an unlimited number of combinations of AM and FM that will generate a given signal. Although Gabor proposed a method for uniquely defining the AM and FM of a signal, namely via the analytic signal, the results obtained are sometimes physically paradoxical. In this paper, four reasonable physical conditions that the calculated AM and FM of a signal should satisfy are proposed. The analytic signal method generally fails to satisfy two of the four conditions. A method utilizing the positive (Cohen–Posch) time-frequency distribution and time-varying coherent demodulation of the signal is given for obtaining an AM and FM that satisfy the four proposed conditions. Contrary to the accepted definition, the instantaneous frequency (i.e., the FM) that satisfies these conditions is generally not the derivative of the phase of the signal. Rather, the phase is separated into two parts, one which gives the instantaneous frequency via differentiation, and the other which can be interpreted either as phase modulation or quadrature amplitude modulation of the signal. Examples are given for synthetic signals and speech, with comparisons to the analytic signal method.`,doi: `10.1121/1.416061`,issn: `0001-4966`,journal: `The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America`,number: `3`,pages: `1594--1601`,title: `On the amplitude‐ and frequency‐modulation decomposition of signals`,volume: `100`,year: `1996`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/envelope/1996 On the amplitude- and frequency-modulation decomposition of signalsa) - Loughlin and Tacer.pdf`,tags: `envelope,#merged`},

An interpolant constructed in this way does not require solving a system of linear equations as many approaches do. However there are vanishing tangent vectors at the interpolating points. By blending with a Bezier curve using the data points as the control points, the blended curve is a proper smooth interpolant. The blending factor has the effect similar to the "tension" control of tension splines. Piecewise interpolants can be constructed in an analogous way as a connection of Bezier curve segments to achieve C 1 continuity at the connecting points. Smooth interpolating surface patches can also be defined by blending sinusoidal polynomial tensor surfaces and Bezier tensor surfaces. The interpolant can very efficiently be evaluated by tabulating the sinusoidal function.`,doi: `10.1016/0377-0427(95)00241-3`,issn: `0377-0427`,journal: `Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics`,langid: `english`,number: `2`,pages: `383--393`,title: `A sinusoidal polynomial spline and its Bezier blended interpolant`,url: `http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0377042795002413`,urldate: `2019-03-28`,volume: `71`,year: `1996`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Computer Graphics/1996 A Sinusoidal Polynomial Spline and Its Bezier Blended Interpolant_1996Loesinusoidal.pdf`,tags: `#merged,computer graphics`},

It contains such musical phenomena as flute breath noise or violin bow noise. Synthesis without such 'noise' tends to sound artificial; it is desirable to improve the synthesis realism by modeling the residual in such a way that it can be reinjected in the synthesized signal. This paper deals with a model of noise perception based on the equivalent rectangular bands (ERBs) of the auditory system. Since a broadband noise is perceptually well-represented by the time-varying energy in each of these frequency bands, the residual is parametrized in terms of these energies in the proposed model. An application of the model to music synthesis based on the inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) is described in detail.`,doi: `10.1109/icassp.1996.543293`,issn: `07367791`,journal: `ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings`,number: `October`,pages: `1005--1008`,title: `Residual modeling in music analysis-synthesis`,volume: `2`,year: `1996`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Music/1996 Residual modeling in music analysis-synthesis - Goodwin.pdf`},

It is clear that the more obser-vations that are available, the more accurately will it be possible to calculate the parameters in the model. This gives rise to the problem of " solving " an overdetermined linear or nonlinear system of equations. It can be shown that the solution which minimizes a weighted sum of the squares of the residual is optimal in a certain sense Ake Bj/"orck, Numerical Methods for Least Squares Prob-lems, SIAM, 1996. Least squares problems appear very naturally when one would like to estimate values of parameters of a mathematical model from measured data, which are subject to errors (see quote above). They appear however also in other con-texts, and form an important subclass of more general optimization problems, see Chapter 12. After several typical examples of least squares problems, we start in Section 6.2 with the linear least squares problem and the natural solution given by the normal equations. There were two fundamental contri-butions to the numerical solution of linear least squares problems in the last century: the first one was the development of the QR factorization by Golub in 1965, and the second one was the implicit QR algorithm for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) by Golub and Reinsch (1970). We introduce the SVD, which is fundamental for the understanding of linear least squares problems, in Section 6.3. We postpone the description of the algorithm for its computation to Chapter 7, but use the SVD to study the condition of the linear least squares problem in Section 6.4. This will show why the normal equations are not necessarily a good approach for solving linear least squares problems, and motivates the use of orthogonal transfor-mations and the QR decomposition in Section 6.5. Like in optimization, least squares problems can also have constraints. We treat the linear least squares problem with linear constraints in full detail in Section 6.6, and a special class with nonlinear constraints in Section 6.7. We then turn to nonlinear least squares problems in Section 6.8, which have to be solved by iteration. We show classical iterative methods for such problems, and like in the case of nonlinear equations, linear least squares problems arise naturally at each iter-ation. We conclude this chapter with an interesting example of least squares fitting with piecewise functions in Section 6.9. The currently best and most thorough reference for least squares methods is the book b Ake Bj/"orck [9].`,doi: `10.1007/978-3-319-04325-8`,isbn: `9783319043258`,journal: `Report`,title: `Chapter 6 .

However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.`,doi: `10.5860/choice.33-6354`,isbn: `9783319110790`,issn: `0009-4978`,journal: `Choice Reviews Online`,number: `11`,pages: `33--6354--33--6354`,title: `Linear algebra done right`,volume: `33`,year: `1996`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Linear Algebra/2015 Linear Algebra Done Right - Sheldon Axler.pdf`},

A general mathematical framework for numerical optimization techniques is introduced and three algorithms of design optimization are reviewed: parameter optimization, shape optimization, and topology optimization. This paper highlights strengths and drawbacks of each method with the use of real-world design of a waveguide and two phase plugs. Where possible, the results are confirmed with prototypes and measurements. The work shows that excellent results can be achieved in just one design iteration with the help of numerical optimization methods.`,pages: `1--11`,title: `Convention Paper`,year: `1995`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Data Compression/2018 Bandwidth extension method based on generative adversarial nets for audio compression - Huang et al..pdf`},

The amplitude envelopes of 24 1/4|-oct bands (covering 100-6400 Hz) were processed in several ways (e.g., fast compression) in order to assess the importance of the modulation peaks and troughs. Results for 60 normal-hearing subjects show that reduction of modulations by the addition of noise is more detrimental to sentence intelligibility than the same degree of reduction achieved by direct manipulation of the envelope; in some cases the benefit in speech-reception threshold (SRT) is almost 7 dB. Two crossover levels can be defined in dividing the temporal envelope into two equally important parts. The first crossover level divides the envelope into two perceptually equal parts: Removing modulations either x dB below or above that level yields the same intelligibility score. The second crossover level divides the envelope into two acoustically equal peak and trough parts. The perceptual level is 9-12 dB higher than the acoustic level, indicating that envelope peaks are perceptually more important than troughs. Further results showed that 24 intact temporal speech envelopes with noise fine structure retain perfect intelligibility. In general, for the present type of signal manipulations, no one-to-one relation between the modulation-transfer function and the intelligibility scores could be established. /textcopyright 1995, Acoustical Society of America.

The resulting instruments exhibit interesting natural vibration mode and sound radiation physics. The tone qualities of the new instruments suggest relations between the guitar response envelope and human sound perception. Translating the principle natural modes of the guitar up or down with string frequencies does not necessarily produce pleasing tone qualities nor optimal playing dynamics. However, designing bracing configurations for both classical and folk baritone and bass guitars to maximise low frequency radiation eficiency does seem to produce new instruments of musical appeal, Frequency response records of standard and guitar family variants illustrate the physical behaviour of the difierent designs.

Unlike the Gabor expansion and the wavelet decomposition, the bandwidth and time-frequency centers of the localized Gaussian elementary functions hp(t) used in the AGR can be adjusted to best match the analyzed signal. Each expansion coefficient Bp is defined as the inner product sp(t) and hp(t), where sp(t) is the remainder of the orthogonal projection of sp-1(t) onto hp-1(t). Consequently, the AGR not only accurately captures signal local behavior, but also has a monotonically decreasing reconstruction error norm of matrixsp(t)norm of matrix2. By combining the AGR and the Wigner-Ville distribution, we further develop an adaptive spectrogram that is non-negative, cross-term free, and of high resolution. Finally, an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the optimal Gaussian elementary functions hp(t) is discussed. /textcopyright 1994.`,doi: `10.1016/0165-1684(94)90174-0`,issn: `01651684`,journal: `Signal Processing`,keywords: `Gabor expansion,Gaussian function,Inner product,Orthogonal,Wavelet,Wigner-Ville distribution`,number: `1`,pages: `1--11`,title: `Signal representation using adaptive normalized Gaussian functions`,volume: `36`,year: `1994`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/allocate/1994 Signal representation using adaptive normalized Gaussian functions - Qian and Chen.pdf`},

  {key: `1994_fritzke`,type: `article`,author: `Bernd Fritzke`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `We present a new self-organizing neural network model that has two variants. The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches (e.g., the Kohonen feature map) is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process that also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method that results from the combination of the above-mentioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible-in contrast to earlier approaches-to perform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks that generalize very well. Results on the two-spirals benchmark and a vowel classification problem are presented that are better than any results previously published. /textcopyright1994.`,doi: `10.1016/0893-6080(94)90091-4`,isbn: `08936080`,issn: `08936080`,journal: `Neural Networks`,keywords: `Clustering,Data visualization,Feature map,Incremental learning,Pattern classification,Radial basis function,Self-organization,Two-spiral problem,evolutive,seminal`,number: `9`,pages: `1441--1460`,publisher: `Elsevier`,title: `Growing cell structures-A self-organizing network for unsupervised and supervised learning`,url: `http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0893608094900914`,volume: `7`,year: `1994`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/Theory/1994 growing cell structures—a self-organizing network for unsupervised and - fritzke.pdf`,tags: `evolutive,seminal,#merged`},

It is shown here how this numerical approach and the underlying physical model can be improved in order to simulate the motion of the piano string with a high degree of realism. Starting from the fundamental equations of a damped, stiff string interacting with a nonlinear hammer, a numerical finite difference scheme is derived, from which the time histories of string displacement and velocity for each point of the string are computed in the time domain. The interacting force between hammer and string, as well as the force acting on the bridge, are given by the same scheme. The performance of the model is illustrated by a few examples of simulated string waveforms. A brief discussion of the aspects of numerical stability and dispersion with reference to the proper choice of sampling parameters is also included. /textcopyright 1994, Acoustical Society of America.

Our method, Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), is significantly better than magnitude-based methods, which can often remove the wrong weights. OBS also represents a major improvement over other methods, such as Optimal Brain Damage [Le Cun, Denker and Solla, 1990], because ours uses the full off-diagonal information of the Hessian matrix H. Crucial to OBS is a recursion relation for calculating H-1 from training data and structural information of the net. We illustrate OBS on standard benchmark problems — the MONK's problems. The most successful method in a recent competition in machine learning [Thrun et al., 1991] was backpropagation using weight decay, which yielded a network with 58 weights for one MONK's problem. OBS requires only 14 weights for the same performance accuracy. On two other MONK's problems, our method required only 38% and 10% of the weights found by magnitude-based pruning.`,isbn: `10495258`,journal: `Advances in NIPS5`,pages: `164--171`,title: `Second order derivaties for network prunning: Optimal brain surgeon`,year: `1993`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/pruning ANNs/1993 Second order derivatives for network pruning Optimal Brain Surgeon.pdf`},

Applications may be found in physical models of drums, soundboards, cymbals, gongs, small-box reverberators, and other acoustic constructs where a one-dimensional model is less desirable.`,edition: `proceeding`,isbn: `10261087`,issn: `1026-1087`,journal: `Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC)`,pages: `40--47`,publisher: `Anais�INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER MUSIC ACCOCIATION`,title: `Physical modeling with the 2-D digital waveguide mesh`,url: `http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece5760/LABS/f2011/vanduyne93physical.pdf`,year: `1993`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Digital Waveguides/1993DuynePhysical Physical Modeling with the 2 D Digital Waveguide Mesh.pdf`,tags: `#merged`},

For solving large and sparse instances of these problems on parallel architectures with distributed memory, the use of static data structures to represent the sparse matrix is preferred during the factorization. But the accurate detection of the rank of the constraint matrix is also very critical to the accuracy of the computed solution. In this work, we examine the solution of the constrained problem using weighting approach. We demonstrate that all computations can be carried out using a static data structure that is generated using the symbolic structure of the input matrices, making use of a recently proposed rank detection procedure. We show good speed-ups in solving large and sparse equality conditioned least squares problems on hypercubes up to 128 processors.`,doi: `10.1109/shpcc.1992.232669`,isbn: `0818627751`,journal: `Proccedings of the Scalable High Performance Computing Conference-SHPCC-92`,pages: `381--384`,publisher: `IEEE Comput.

  {key: `1992_smith1`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `Julius O Smith`,abstract: `Music synthesis based on a physical model promises the highest quality when it comes to imitating natural instruments. Because the artificial instrument can have the same control parameters as the real instrument, expressivity of control is unbounded. Historically, physical models have led to prohibitively expensive synthesis algorithms, and commercially available synthesizers do not yet appear to make use of them. These days, most synthesizers use either processed digital recordings ("sampling synthesis") or an abstract algorithm such as frequency modulation (FM). However, as computers become faster and cheaper, and as algorithms based on physical models become more efficient, we may expect to hear more from them. Most attempts to synthesize sounds based on a physical model have been based on numerical integration of the wave equation (covered in any textbook on acoustics). These methods generally require at least one operation (multiplication and/or addition) for each point on a grid that permeates the instrument. In principle, the grid spacing must be less than half a wavelength at the highest audio frequency. This is essentially why the computational costs are so high in "brute force" numerical solutions of the wave equation. More recently developed "digital waveguide" methods follow a different path to the physical model; the wave equation is first solved in a general way to obtain traveling waves in the medium interior. The traveling waves are explicitly simulated in the waveguide model, in contrast to computing a physical variable. (The traveling waves must be summed together to produce a physical output.) In the lossless case, a traveling wave between two points in the medium can be simulated using nothing but a digital delay line. In the general linear case, in which there are frequency-dependent losses and dispersion, the commutativity of linear time-invariant systems allows the losses and dispersion to be lumped at discrete points such that most of the simulation still consists of multiply-free delay lines. This is essentially why computational costs are so low in "waveguide synthesis" algorithms. Computer-music programmers know very well that a delay line can be implemented by a single fetch, store, and pointer update for each sample of output. If the delay line is, say, 500 samples long (corresponding to a pitch of 44,100/500=88 Hz in a string or bore model of compact disk quality), computational requirements relative to "brute force" numerical integration on the grid are reduced by three orders of magnitude. As a result, for very simple physical models, several CD-quality voices can be sustained in real time on a single digital signal processing (DSP) chip costing only a few dollars. This article develops waveguide synthesis beginning with the wave equation for vibrating strings. Transverse waves on a string are taken as the primary example due to the relative clarity of the underlying physics, but the formulation for string simulation is unified with that of the acoustic tube. The technique of lumping losses at discrete points in the waveguide, replacing more expensive distributed losses, is described.`,doi: `10.2307/3680470`,issn: `01489267`,journal: `Computer Music Journal`,number: `4`,pages: `74`,title: `Physical Modeling Using Digital Waveguides`,volume: `16`,year: `1992`,tags: `#merged`},

  {key: `1992_kusuma_etal`,type: `article`,author: `Tony Kusuma and Mark M. Brown`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `The neural network paradigm has been gaining recognition in geophysics as an alternative approach to solving various problems, especially those associated with pattern recognition and prediction tasks. Most of the work that has been done uses some form of back-propagation algorithm. A back-propagation network is simple and easy to implement. However, it learns too slowly for many real-life, non-trivial applications and lends to scale up poorly as the problem gels larger and more complex. It is also prone to getting trapped in local minima on the error surface. This sludy evaluates the performance of the cascade-correlation learning architecture in first break picking and automatic trace editing tasks. Empirical results show that, in comparison to the back-propagation mcthod, cascade correlation learning enables us to achieve a 10 to 50-foldspcedup in both tasks without getting trapped in local minima. Since cascade-correlation is a dynamic learning process, the size of the net obtained aller the learning session is guaranteed to be nearly optimal. Unlike back-propagation, a cascade-correlation net can be trained Incrementally while retaining most of the knowledge from its previous training session. Therefore, a large training data set can be broken up into smaller pieces and training can be cumulative.`,doi: `10.1190/1.1821929`,journal: `1992 SEG Annual Meeting`,pages: `1136--1139`,title: `Cascade-correlation learning architecture for first-break picking and automated trace editing`,year: `1992`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/pruning ANNs/1990 The cascade-correlation learning architecture.pdf`},

In this paper the concept of IF is extended to be able to cope with discrete time signals. The specific problem explored is that of estimating the IF of frequency modulated (FM) discrete-time signals imbedded in Gaussian noise. There are many well established methods for estimating the IF—these methods include differentiation of the phase and smoothing thereof, adaptive frequency estimation techniques such as the phase locked loop (PLL), and extraction of the peak from time-varying spectral representations. More recently methods based on a modeling of the signal phase as a polynomial have been introduced. All of these methods are reviewed, and their performances are compared on both simulated and real data.

It is intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of the design strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the fundamental ideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will build upon this base. Chapter 1 is an overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. This chapter defines what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also makes a case that algorithms are a technology, just as are fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks. In Chapter 2, we see our first algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting a sequence of n numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not directly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the structure of the algorithm clearly enough that a competent programmer can implement it in the language of his choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, which uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive technique known as divide and conquer. Although the time each requires increases with the value of n, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We determine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful notation to express them. Chapter 3 precisely defines this notation, which we call asymptotic notation. It starts by defining several asymptotic notations, which we use for bounding algorithm running times from above and/or below. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily a presentation of mathematical notation. Its purpose is more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.`,annote: `OCLC: 698955316`,doi: `10.2307/2583667`,edition: `3`,isbn: `97802620338489780262533058`,issn: `01605682`,journal: `The Journal of the Operational Research Society`,number: `9`,pages: `816`,publisher: `MIT Press`,title: `Introduction to Algorithms`,volume: `42`,year: `1991`,tags: `#merged,#corrupted author`},

An approach is taken in this paper which does not require an explicit use of the truth table. The design objective is the minimization of the average number of errors, rather than a minimization of the number of logical components used. The nature of the logical elements is quite unconventional. The system design procedure is adaptive, and is based upon an iterative search process. Performance feedback is used to achieve automatic system synthesis, i.e., the selection of the 'best' system from a restricted but useful class of possibilities. The designer 'trains' the system to give the correct responses by 'showing' it examples of inputs and respective desired outputs. The more examples 'seen', the better is the system performance.`,journal: `Wescon Conference Record`,pages: `709--717`,title: `Adaptive switching circuits`,volume: `1960`,year: `1989`,tags: `#merged,tesse`},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

Second the models, when applied properly, work very well in practice for several important applications.

In the EORTC ALL-3 trial, the efficacy of allogeneic transplantation was compared with that of autologous marrow transplantation and maintenance chemotherapy in patients ≤ 50 years who reached CR. Design and Methods. Among 340 patients who entered the study, 279 were ≤ 50 years old. Out of these, 220 reached CR, 184 patients started consolidation and were HLA typed; 68 had a donor and 116 had no sibling donor. The median follow-up was 9.5 years; 93 patients relapsed, 26 died in CR, and overall 116 patients died. Allogeneic transplantation was performed in 47 (68%) patients with a donor while autologous transplantation or maintenance chemotherapy was given to 84 (72%) patients without a sibling donor. Results. The 6-year disease-free survival rate was similar in the groups with and without donor [38.2% (SE=5.9%) vs. 36.8% (SE=4.6%), hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.67-1.53]. Comparing the donor group with the no donor group, the former had a lower relapse incidence (38.2% vs. 56.3%, p=0.001), but a higher cumulative incidence of death in CR (23.5% vs. 6.9%, p=0.0004). The 6-year survival rates were similar [41.2% (SE=6.0%) vs. 38.8% (SE=4.6%)]. Interpretation and Conclusions.

The work described in these two volumes suggests that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. It is some of the most exciting work in cognitive science, unifying neural and cognitive processes in a highly computational framework, with links to artificial intelligence. Although thought and problem solving have a sequential character when viewed over a time frame of minutes or hours, the authors argue that each step in the sequence is the result of the simultaneous activity of a large number of simple computational elements, each influencing others and being influenced by them. "Parallel Distributed Processing" describes their work in developing a theoretical framework for describing this parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Volume 2 applies to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience. Some chapters describe models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Others discuss the relation between parallel distributed processing models and neurophysiology or describe models that are specifically addressed to neurophysiological data.

Stegun. That 1046-page tome proved to be an invaluable reference for the many scien- tists and engineers who use the special functions of applied mathematics in their day-to-day work, so much so that it became the most widely distributed and most highly cited NIST publication in the first 100 years of the institution's existence.2 The success of the original handbook, widely referred to as "Abramowitz and Stegun" ("A&S"), derived not only from the fact that it provided critically useful scientific data in a highly accessible format, but also because it served to standardize definitions and notations for special functions. The provision of standard reference data of this type is a core function of NIST. Much has changed in the years since A&S was published. Certainly, advances in applied mathe- matics have continued unabated. However, we have also seen the birth of a new age of computing technology, which has not only changed how we utilize special functions, but also how we commu- nicate technical information. The document you are now holding, or the Web page you are now reading, represents an effort to extend the legacy of A&S well into the 21st century. The new printed volume, the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions, serves a similar function as the original A&S, though it is heavily updated and extended. The online version, the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF), presents the same technical information along with extensions and innovative interactive features consistent with the new medium. The DLMF may well serve as a model for the effective presentation of highly mathematical reference material on the Web. The production of these new resources has been a very complex undertaking some 10 years in the making. This could not have been done without the cooperation of many mathematicians, information technologists, and physical scientists both within NIST and externally. Their unfailing dedication is acknowledged deeply and gratefully.

There exist numerous learning rules for finding a set of weights to achieve a particular correspondence between input-output pairs. But early works in the field have shown that the number of threshold functions (or linearly separable functions) in N binary variables is small compared to the number of all possible boolean mappings in N variables, especially if N is large. This problem is one of the main limitations of most neural networks models where the state is fully specified by the environment during learning: they can only learn linearly separable functions of their inputs. Moreover, a learning procedure which requires the outside world to specify the state of every neuron during the learning session can hardly be considered as a general learning rule because in real-world conditions, only a partial information on the "ideal" network state for each task is available from the environment. It is possible to use a set of so-called "hidden units" [Hinton,Sejnowski,Ackley. 84], without direct interaction with the environment, which can compute intermediate predicates. Unfortunately, the global response depends on the output of a particular hidden unit in a highly non-linear way, moreover the nature of this dependence is influenced by the states of the other cells.`,doi: `10.1007/978-3-642-82657-3_24`,journal: `Disordered Systems and Biological Organization`,pages: `233--240`,title: `Learning Process in an Asymmetric Threshold Network`,year: `1986`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Articles/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks/backpropagation alternative/1986 Learning Process in an Asymmetric Threshold Network.pdf`},

Kofi Agawu's Music as Discourse has become a standard and definitive work in musical semiotics. Working at the nexus of musicology, ethnomusicology, and music philosophy and aesthetics, Agawu presents a synthetic and innovative approach to musical meaning which argues deftly for the thinking of music as a discourse in itself—composed not only of sequences of gestures, phrases, or progressions, but rather also of the very philosophical and linguistic props that enable the analytical formulations made about music as an object of study. The book provides extensive demonstration of the pertinence of a semiological approach to understanding the fully-freighted language of romantic music, stresses the importance of a generative approach to tonal understanding, and provides further insight into the analogy between music and language.

All the information that is needed to perform the analysis is the sequence numbers of the well and the time it takes to reach a given depth. This paper presents some typical examples of DPC's covering a study of over 30 different areas (onshore and offshore) including over 2000 wells. From the data, a simple model for the overall drilling performance was derived. Three constants Ci, C2 and C3 are unique to the DPC. From the numerical value of the constants, the drilling performance can be derived. For example, the Ci constant indicates how well an operation is prepared to drill a given location and/or how difficult the area is to drill. The C2 constant directly reflects the rate of learning. The C3 constant indicates the level of technology and organization for drilling in a particular area. This paper will present cases from poor to excellent drilling with the associated coefficients. It will be shown that the DPC can dictate the strategy for a drilling program and what the economics of drilling a sequence of wells should be in a given area. It is suggested that the DPC become the yardstick for evaluating drilling, much as the decline curve is for production.`,doi: `10.2523/15362-ms`,isbn: `9781555636074`,journal: `Proceedings - SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition`,pages: `12`,title: `The drilling performance curve: A yardstick for judging drilling Performance`,year: `1986`,tags: `#merged`},

However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a compre- hensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma- chine learning concepts.

Allen`,abstract: `This major work covers almost all that has been learned about the acoustics of stringed instruments from Helmholtz's 19th-century theoretical elaborations to recent electroacoustic and holographic measurements. Many of the results presented here were uncovered by the author himself (and by his associates and students) over a 20-year period of research on the physics of instruments in the violin family. Lothar Cremer is one of the world's most respected authorities on architectural acoustics and, not incidentally, an avid avocational violinist and violist.The book―which was published in German in 1981―first of all meets the rigorous technical standards of specialists in musical acoustics. But it also serves the needs and interests of two broader groups: makers and players of stringed instruments are expressly addressed, since the implications of the mathematical formulations are fully outlined and explained; and acousticians in general will find that the work represents a textbook illustration of the application of fundamental principles and up-to-date techniques to a specific problem. The first―and longest―of the book's three parts investigates the oscillatory responses of bowed (and plucked) strings. The natural nonlinearities that derive from considerations of string torsion and bending stiffness are deftly handled and concisely modeled. The second part deals with the body of the instrument. Special attention is given to the bridge, which transmits the oscillations of the strings to the wooden body and its air cavity. In this case, linear modeling proves serviceable for the most part―a simplification that would not be possible with lute―like instruments such as the guitar. The radiation of sound from the body into the listener's space, which is treated as an extension of the instrument itself, is the subject of the book's final part.`,edition: `uk ed. edition`,isbn: `9780262527071`,pagetotal: `474`,publisher: `The MIT Press`,title: `The Physics of the Violin`,year: `1984`},

In this chapter, we highlight the most important aspects of the topic, taking advantage of prior development of discrete and continuous stochastic models in this book. Beginning with discussing model building for simulation analysis relevant in various application areas, we review the fundamentals of simulation in terms of random variates generation, model validation, and simulation output analysis. We consider manufacturing and service systems, where we are concerned with the optimal layout and configuration of manufacturing operations or service delivery setup for best-performance characteristics, or sensitivity analysis from changes made in layout or changes appearing due to breakdowns. The second application domain we consider is that of communication and transportation networks, where flow of entities is on a fixed infrastructure designed to meet customer demand, while satisfying 'physical' constraints of the system. Therefore, capability analysis is often the motivation of evaluating such systems for meeting demand as well as quality of service delivered to customers. We finally consider two example application domains in banking and finance, one in asset valuation and allocation and the other in risk management. In the second part of the chapter, we delve into specialized topics of interest for a simulation study, such as variance reduction techniques, rare-event simulation, and stochastic Kriging. For a more sophisticated use of simulation modeling and analysis, we developmodeling approaches for simulation of dynamic systems. Acknowledging that many decision analytics problems extend to assessing better or the best configurations of systems or ways of performing tasks, the chapter presents simulation-based optimization methodologies and techniques to address optimal decision-making problems. While we have initiated the chapter with several specific application domains where simulation modeling and analysis is extensively utilized, the entire chapter is interspersed with examples for making a stronger context for an analyst to benefit from the topics covered. This chapter is devoted to developing simulation modeling and analysis concepts and techniques to address decision analysis problems. Simulation modeling and analysis is a vast topic, and a powerful suite of techniques, for solving a broad array of problems. This chapter will highlight in brevity the most important aspects of the topic. Taking advantage of prior discussions on discrete and continuous random variables and distributions, this chapter will begin with describing model building for simulation analysis of decision making. The next several major topics will develop the fundamentals of simulation modeling and analysis, through topics such as random variates generation, model validation, and simulation output analysis. This is followed by specialized topics on variance reduction techniques, rare-event simulation, stochastic Kriging, and simulation of dynamic systems for more sophisticated use of simulation modeling and analysis. The later part of this chapter focuses on simulation-based optimization methodologies and techniques to address optimal decision-making problems that may be solved using simulation in conjunction with optimization techniques. While the entire chapter is interspersed with examples, we initiate the chapter with several specific application domains where simulation modeling and analysis is extensively utilized. We will end the chapter by pointing to the future challenges facing simulation modeling and analysis for decision making today.`,doi: `10.2307/2288169`,isbn: `9780073401324`,issn: `01621459`,journal: `Journal of the American Statistical Association`,number: `383`,pages: `743`,title: `Simulation Modeling and Analysis.`,volume: `78`,year: `1983`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New BOOKS/2013 Simulation modeling and analysis - Law.pdf`},
  {key: `1983_mcintyre_etal1`,type: `article`,author: `M E McIntyre and R T Schumacher and J Woodhouse`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `The time-domain description of musical and other nonlinear oscillators complements the more commonly used frequency-domain description, and is advantageous for some purposes. It is especially advantageous when studying large-amplitude oscillations, for which nonlinearity may be severe. It gives direct insight into the physical reasons for the variation of waveform as playing conditions vary, and into certain phenomena which may seem counter-intuitive from the frequency-domain viewpoint, such as the musically undesirable flattening in the pitch of a bowed string when the bow is pressed too hard onto the string. It is easy to set up efficient time-domain simulations on a small computer, a fact that has been surprisingly little exploited in musical acoustics. The simplest relevant model is described here. It demonstrates some of the basic nonlinear behavior of the clarinet, violin, and flute families with very little programming effort. Remarkably, a single set of model equations has relevance to all three cases, at a certain level of idealization, with appropriate choices of parameter values and of linear and nonlinear characteristics. For the flute family, this simplest model gives waveforms and phase relations closely resembling those observed at resonance in the organ-pipe experiments of Coltman [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 60, 725–733 (1976)], including the triangular pressure and velocity waveforms. It can be shown (again using a time-domain approach) that the triangular waveform is a universal limiting form, independent of detailed acoustic loss mechanisms provided losses are small. /textcopyright1983, Acoustical Society of America.

This book is directed primarily toward the industrial engineer or scientist in research or development with a firm technical background who is attempting to apply that background to polymerization processes. It should also be suitable as a text for courses dealing with chemical engineering aspects of polymer processes.

This extended work is the culmination of forty years' research and shows the belief that we all can, and do, design, and that we can learn to design better. The creative mind continues to have the power to surprise and this book aims to nurture and extend this creativity. Neither the earlier editions, nor this book, are intended as authoritative prescriptions of how designers should think but provide helpful advice on how to develop an understanding of design. In this fourth edition, Bryan Lawson continues to try and understand how designers think, to explore how they might be better educated and to develop techniques to assist them in their task. Some chapters have been revised and three completely new chapters added. The book is now intended to be read in conjunction with What Designers Know which is a companion volume. Some of the ideas previously discussed in the third edition of How Designers Think are now explored more thoroughly in What Designers Know. For the first time this fourth edition works towards a model of designing and the skills that collectively constitute the design process.`,doi: `10.1016/0142-694x(81)90033-8`,isbn: `9780750660778`,issn: `0142694X`,journal: `Design Studies`,number: `1`,pages: `55--56`,title: `How designers think`,volume: `2`,year: `1981`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Design/2006 How designers think - the design process demystified - Lawson.pdf`},

  {key: `1980_r_etal`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,author: `J. R. and Carl de Boor`,translator: ` `,abstract: `This book is based on the author's experience with calculations involving polynomial splines. It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.`,doi: `10.2307/2006241`,issn: `00255718`,journal: `Mathematics of Computation`,number: `149`,pages: `325`,title: `A Practical Guide to Splines.`,volume: `34`,year: `1980`},

This article describes INTERAX, a method for generating alternative future scenarios which requires very few simplifying assumptions. To accelerate the time required for the analysis, INTERAX includes a large multidisciplinary data base, which is of immediate use in a broad range of long-range strategic issues. INTERAX is described in two articles. This article describes the method and its philosophy and presents the data base. The second part, which will appear in the next issue of Technological Forecasting and Social Change, describes bow INTERAX generates scenarios and their use in exploring a variety of strategic issues.`,doi: `10.1016/0040-1625(80)90049-9`,issn: `0040-1625`,journal: `Technological Forecasting and Social Change`,langid: `english`,number: `2`,pages: `141--159`,shorttitle: `INTERAX—An interactive model for studying future business environments`,title: `INTERAX—An interactive model for studying future business environments: Part I`,url: `http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0040162580900499`,urldate: `2019-04-07`,volume: `17`,year: `1980`},

  {key: `1979_justice`,type: `article`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,author: `James H Justice`,abstract: `AbNtruct-Digital synthesis of music has led to the consideration of models other than the usual additive (Fourier) synthesis of waveforms. One of these methods, based on the FM equation, has been found to be of particular value due to its easy implementation and the richness and evolutionary character of its harmonic structure in time. Any useful synthesis procedure should be accompanied by a corresponding analytic procedure. In this paper we lay the foundations for such a procedure based on the discrete Hilbert transform. I. INTRODUCTION STIMULATING, challenging, and relatively new appli-cation of digital signal processing is to be found in the area of music generation via digital computer. By music gen-eration, we mean the production of purposefully structured sounds in the broad sense. That is, we wish to control not only the means of sound synthesis itself, including the shaping of timbre and other tone characteristics, but we wish to pro-vide the means to orchestrate sounds into larger structures or compositions with a minimum of restrictions in achieving whatever sort of goal we may have in mind. In short, our goal is nothing less than complete control of the sound en-vironment including the warp and woof of sound textures, rhythms, .and pitches; the entire spectrum of sound charac-teristics from which the patterned cloth of music is woven. Indeed, tomorrow's composer/performer, the weaver, may find himself as much at home with CRT terminals, graphic tablets, and joy sticks as he now does with his instruments, paper, pen, and baton. Since the creation of the first music generation program in 1958 by M. Mathews of Bell Labs [ 6 ] , an ever growing num-ber of engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and artists, all with a common goal, have been intent on converting the digital computer into a responsive and sensitive instrument capable of enhancing and extending our musical powers. The setting was eminently suited for, and indeed demanded the use of digital signal processing principles and techniques of all kinds, and few stones are being left unturned. And, just as any new area of inquiry draws heavily on the tools of the past, its own unique challenges will hopefully always con-tribute something new which may find use in other areas as well, or perhaps pave a road to new and as yet unseen areas of application. We do not need to look very deeply into the complexities of digital music generation to appreciate the need to find`,journal: `Ieee Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing`,number: `6`,title: `nal Processin`,year: `1979`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Thesis/envelope/analytic signal/Analytic_signal_processing_in_music_comp.pdf`},

Now, at last, there is a coherent theory which describes in modern terms an architecture as ancient as human society itself. The Timeless Way of Building is the introductory volume in the Center for Environmental Structure series, Christopher Alexander presents in it a new theory of architecture, building, and planning which has at its core that age-old process by which the people of a society have always pulled the order of their world from their own being. Alexander writes, "There is one timeless way of building. It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way.

A model placing these two variables as mediators between disease severity and QoL was tested with structural equation modeling. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with epilepsy (58% men, age 36+/-12 years) were given the following instruments: Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Epileptic Self-Efficacy Scale, Locus of Control scale, and the World Health Organization's Quality of Life Questionnaire, the WHOQOL. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling showed good fit between the research model and the data (Bentler-Bonett Normalized Index of fit, 0.96; LISREL GFI, 0.95). Ninety percent of the variance of the WHOQOL was explained by a combination of disease severity, self-efficacy in epilepsy, social support, and locus of control. Mastery was found to mediate the correlation between disease severity and QoL, and social support was found to act as a mediator between disease severity and mastery. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings emphasize the possibility of improving QoL among patients with epilepsy by counseling and treatment aimed at reinforcing their self-efficacy and locus of control, as well as by improving their SoS.`,keywords: `debt equity ratio,pertumbuhan laba,total asset turnover`,number: `3`,pages: `1--19`,title: `PDF created with FinePrint pdfFactory Pro trial version www.pdffactory.com`,volume: `12`,year: `1978`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Luthiery/MezzalunaBWTiled.pdf`},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. in the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an "optimal" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. for purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients. Finally, a brief introduction to pole-zero modeling is given. /textcopyright 1975, IEEE.

Chu`,translator: ` `,editor: ` `,abstract: `The effective potential formalism of Rabitz is extended to a general potential expressed in terms of relative or body-fixed coordinates and applied to the study of the H2-HD rotationally inelastic collisions. The H, and HD molecules are treated as rigid rotors and their interaction potential is derived from the H2-H2 potential. Long-range quadrupole-dipole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions are also considered. Quantum-mechanical close-coupling calculations for three-dimensional collisions of para-H2, and ortho-H2 with HD are performed up to E=0.20 eV. The general features of the rotational excitation cross sections of HD are examined and their sensitivity to certain aspects of the potential are analyzed. In particular, the different roles of the short- and long-range anisotropies are illustrated. It is found that the degree of anisotropy is meaningful only in relation to the magnitude of the "effectively" spherically symmetric part of potential. The rate constants for pure rotational transitions of HD are presented in the temperature range of 5 to 800 °K. The relation of these results to the quantitative interpretation of the thermal balance of interstellar clouds is pointed out. We have also calculated the rotational relaxation times for the lowest two levels of HD, which could be examined and compared with future sound absorption experiments to assess the accuracy of the H2-HD interaction potential.

  {key: `1973_nica`,type: `book`,author: `Bogdan Nica`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `This chapter introduces the basic terminology associated with the graph theory. The chapter presents several binary operations on graphs. These operations construct more complicated graphs and build examples of frequently encountered graphs. A graph is said to be Eulerian if the graph itself can be expressed as a closed trail. A graph is said to be Hamiltonian if it has a spanning cycle. (This corresponds to the "traveling salesman" problem; Hamiltonian graphs have not been completely characterized). The chapter also presents certain subgraphs that are known by their special names through a series of definitions. The chapter discusses various infinite families of graphs, bipartite graphs, and nontrivial graph. The chapter also presents several definitions of bipartite graph, labeled graph, nontrivial graph, directed graph, and their associated problems. /textcopyright 1984, Academic Press, Inc.`,doi: `10.1016/S0304-0208(08)71130-7`,isbn: `9783037191880`,issn: `03040208`,journal: `North-Holland Mathematics Studies`,number: `C`,pages: `5--13`,title: `A brief introduction to graph theory`,volume: `8`,year: `1973`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Graph Theory/2018 A Brief Introduction to Spectral Graph Theory - Bogdan Nica.pdf`},

Data obtained by electrostatic probes form the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the clean air boundary-layer plasma of a slender re-entry vehicle. Corroboration of two independent, yet complementary, theoretical models has been obtained: 1) A simple diffusion/convection model determines electron levels within the plasma on the basis of measured probe currents. Independence of the probe bias for a range of altitudes and positions on the vehicle is strong evidence of this model's essential correctness; 2) A complete numerical solution to the equations governing the vehicle's hypersonic, reacting flowfield has been generated. The boundary-layer plasma is embedded in this solution as a trace species (e-) distribution. Agreement between the calculated electron densities and the processed probe data is qualitatively complete and quantitatively compelling: for a wide range of altitudes and all probe stations the agreement is within experimental accuracy. /textcopyright 1973 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Abstract Purpose – Directors play a hard-to-quantify but critical role in the success of corporations. Outside directors supplement the firm-specific knowledge of inside directors by providing expertise and monitoring. Prior research finds that outside directors who are commercial bankers can be both beneficial and costly to large, non-financial corporations. Smaller, bank-dependent corporations should benefit more than large firms from the services banker directors provide, but may also be more prone to the costs they can impose. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of bank dependency on appointments of banker directors. Design/methodology/approach – The author estimates models relating the probability of a first-time banker-director appointment to proxies of bank dependency on data for a matched sample of firms with and without banker directors drawn from a size-representative sample of Compustat firms. Findings – Bank-dependent firms are less likely to appoint bankers as directors than bank-independent firms. Bank-dependent firms are also less likely to appoint bankers whose employers are firms' creditors (i.e. affiliated bankers). Bank-dependent and bank-independent firms are indistinguishable in their probabilities of appointing unaffiliated bankers as directors. Practical implications – Bank-dependent firms with unexploited growth opportunities appear unable to ameliorate their financial constraints by having banker directors. Appointing retired bankers to boards may give firms the benefits of banker directors without the costs. Originality/value – This paper is the first to: document the prevalence of banker directors at smaller corporations; present econometric evidence on banker-director appointments at firms ranging from small to large; and identify bank dependency as a factor limiting appointments of affiliated banker directors.`,doi: `10.2307/2977800`,isbn: `9780136119463`,issn: `00221082`,journal: `The Journal of Finance`,number: `4`,pages: `688`,title: `Managerial Finance.`,volume: `17`,year: `1962`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Management/2012 Principles of managerial finance - Gitman et al.pdf`},

Halmos`,editor: ` `,translator: ` `,abstract: `Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$/alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 /AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.`,doi: `10.2307/3612585`,isbn: `9780486814865`,issn: `00255572`,journal: `The Mathematical Gazette`,number: `348`,pages: `142`,title: `Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces`,volume: `44`,year: `1960`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/Non-Fiction/Linear Algebra/2017 Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces - Paul R.

Such problems arise, for example, in the analysis of multicomponent radioactive decay curves, and in the study of the dielectric properties of certain compounds. This paper is concerned with the numerical evaluation of a mathematical approach to the problem. The approach is based on the inversion of the Laplace integral equation by a method of Fourier transforms. The results of the analysis appear in the form of a frequency spectrum. Each true peak in the spectrum indicates a component, the abscissa value at the center of the peak is the decay constant X,-, while the height of the peak is directly proportional to Ni/\$/lambda\$t. Results obtained on an IBM 650 computer indicate that the method may possess certain advantages over previous methods of analysis.`,doi: `10.1063/1.1730560`,issn: `00219606`,journal: `The Journal of Chemical Physics`,keywords: `qualityAssured`,number: `4`,pages: `978--986`,qualityassured: `qualityAssured`,title: `Method for the analysis of multicomponent exponential decay curves`,volume: `31`,year: `1959`,file: `C:/Users/tesse/Desktop/Files/Dropbox/BIBrep/0 New PAPERS/allocate/1959 Method for the Analysis of Multicomponent Exponential Decay Curves - Gardner et al..pdf`,tags: `#merged`},
