Our work extends previous work by Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework. We design a multiagent Q-learning method under this framework, and prove that it converges to a Nash equilibrium under speci ed conditions. This algorithm is useful for nding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to nd optimal strategies.",, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,english,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efﬁcient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive ﬁeld. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We ﬁnd that the latent alignment structure contained in the representations reﬂects the expected alignment between the tokens.",tesse, ,,,,,,,,,"1610.10099v2},",,,,,,31/10/2016,,,,,,,,,," {1610.10099},",,arxiv,,,,,,,,,arXiv:1610.10099 [cs],,english,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26/03/2019,,

This task requires an image model that is at once expressive, tractable and scalable. We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two- dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNel dataset.

You will also need a course ID from your instructor to access MyOMLab. Operations management is important, exciting, challenging … and everywhere you look! Important, because it enables organizations to provide services and products that we all need Exciting, because it is central to constant changes in customer preference, networks of supply and demand, and developments in technology Challenging, because solutions must be must be financially sound, resource-efficient, as well as environmentally and socially responsible And everywhere, because in our daily lives, whether at work or at home, we all experience and manage processes and operations. New features: There are now more than 110 of the popular ‘Operations in Practice’ examples throughout the book, over 40 ///% of which are new. The importance of sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been emphasized further, and included throughout the book. We have even further strengthened the emphasis on the idea that ‘operations management’ is relevant to every type of business and all functional areas of the organization. Many new ideas in operations management have been incorporated, including the ‘three level’ approach to performance, the relationship between innovation, creativity and design, crowdsourcing, ideas management, business ecosystems, triadic relationships, office layout, telecommuting and organisational ‘ambidexterity’. However, we have retained the emphasis on the foundations of the subject. Six of the 19 cases at the end of the chapter are new (but the old ones are still available on the web site), and provide an up-to-date selection of operations issues. Operations Management focuses on the sustainable and socially responsible imperatives of operations management, using over 120 cases and illustrations of real-life operations around the world, including Apple, Médecins Sans Frontières, Amazon, Ecover, Dyson, Disneyland Paris, Google, The North Face, and many more.
