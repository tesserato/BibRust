abstract = {We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of generalsum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (deﬁned by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the ﬁrst grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of ofﬂine learning performance in both games, we ﬁnd agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we adopt general-sum stochastic games as a framework for multiagent reinforcement learning. Our work extends previous work by Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework. We design a multiagent Q-learning method under this framework, and prove that it converges to a Nash equilibrium under speci ed conditions. This algorithm is useful for nding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to nd optimal strategies.},

abstract = {This work explores conditional image generation with a new image density model based on the PixelCNN architecture. The model can be conditioned on any vector, including descriptive labels or tags, or latent embeddings created by other networks. When conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database, the model is able to generate diverse, realistic scenes representing distinct animals, objects, landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face, it generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial expressions, poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional PixelCNN can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder. Additionally, the gated convolutional layers in the proposed model improve the log-likelihood of PixelCNN to match the state-of-the-art performance of PixelRNN on ImageNet, with greatly reduced computational cost.},

abstract = {Modeling the distribution of natural images is a landmark problem in unsupervised learning. This task requires an image model that is at once expressive, tractable and scalable. We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two-dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset. Samples generated from the model appear crisp, varied and globally coherent.},

abstract = {We present a novel neural network for processing sequences. The ByteNet is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efﬁcient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive ﬁeld. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We ﬁnd that the latent alignment structure contained in the representations reﬂects the expected alignment between the tokens.},

abstract = {Modeling the distribution of natural images is a landmark problem in unsupervised learning. This task requires an image model that is at once expressive, tractable and scalable. We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two- dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNel dataset. Samples generated from the model appear crisp, varied and globally coherent.},

The model can be conditioned on any vector, including descriptive labels or tags, or latent embeddings created by other networks. When conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database, the model is able to generate diverse, realistic scenes representing distinct animals, objects, landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face, it generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial expressions, poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional PixelCNN can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder.

Buy Operations Management, 8th edition with MyOMLab access card (ISBN 9781292098777) if you need access to MyOMLab as well, and save money on this resource. You will also need a course ID from your instructor to access MyOMLab. Operations management is important, exciting, challenging … and everywhere you look! Important, because it enables organizations to provide services and products that we all need Exciting, because it is central to constant changes in customer preference, networks of supply and demand, and developments in technology Challenging, because solutions must be must be financially sound, resource-efficient, as well as environmentally and socially responsible And everywhere, because in our daily lives, whether at work or at home, we all experience and manage processes and operations. New features: There are now more than 110 of the popular ‘Operations in Practice’ examples throughout the book, over 40 ///% of which are new. The importance of sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been emphasized further, and included throughout the book. We have even further strengthened the emphasis on the idea that ‘operations management’ is relevant to every type of business and all functional areas of the organization. Many new ideas in operations management have been incorporated, including the ‘three level’ approach to performance, the relationship between innovation, creativity and design, crowdsourcing, ideas management, business ecosystems, triadic relationships, office layout, telecommuting and organisational ‘ambidexterity’. However, we have retained the emphasis on the foundations of the subject. Six of the 19 cases at the end of the chapter are new (but the old ones are still available on the web site), and provide an up-to-date selection of operations issues. Operations Management focuses on the sustainable and socially responsible imperatives of operations management, using over 120 cases and illustrations of real-life operations around the world, including Apple, Médecins Sans Frontières, Amazon, Ecover, Dyson, Disneyland Paris, Google, The North Face, and many more. This is 24-carat excellence'Par Åhlström, Torsten and Ragnar Söderberg Chair of Business Administration, Stockholm School of Economics 'Operations Management is engaging and accessible, but it never dumbs-down. The book is comprehensive, but not overwhelming. Students hold on to this one; it’s a ‘keeper’.'Michael Shulver, Birmingham Business School 'This continues to be the definitive operations Management text … written by the masters of the field!'Dr Ross Ritchie, Lecturer in Operations Management, Loughborough University 'An essential text packed full of up-to-date examples that really bring the subject to life'Claire Moxham, University of Liverpool Management School 'An excellent book for those studying operations management. This book provides great illustrations to seamlessly link theory with practice' Frank Wiengarten, ESADE Business School Operations Management by Nigel Slack and Alistair Brandon-Jones is quite simply the best text on operations management.

We apply network-in-network principles, batch normalization, residual connections and convolutional LSTMs to build very deep recurrent and convolutional structures. Our models exploit the spectral structure in the feature space and add computational depth without overfitting issues.
