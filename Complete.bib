volume={70},
abstract={In this work the effect of two different bridge conﬁgurations on the vibrations of the top plate of a classical guitar is presented. Experimental harmonic analysis and visualization techniques, in addition to detailed damped simulations using the ﬁnite element method, were used to obtain mobility functions and operating deﬂection shapes of a top plate. The mobility functions were obtained in the following sequence. First the mobility functions were obtained on the top plate without a bridge attached. Then a bridge was glued to the top plate and new measurements were made. Finally the already attached bridge was cross-cut in situ without detaching it from the top plate, and the measurements were repeated. Those speciﬁc designs were chosen on the grounds of simplicity of construction both experimentally and in FEM simulations (no particular preference for those designs is implied). The assembly and the speciﬁc design of the bridge have shown to have considerable inﬂuence on the response of the top plate regarding the mode shapes above 300 Hz. Depending on the geometry of the bridge, its deﬂections can either be comparable to the maximum deﬂections of the top plate or can have amplitudes so small that the bridge effectively creates a nodal zone on the plate vibrations. This suggests that the shape, the stiffness, and the mass properties of the bridge may play a role in the sound quality of the instrument. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results of all these measurements show that high frequency vibrations and radiation occurs signiﬁcantly from 1 to 14 kHz, but that the sound radiation has harmonics at frequencies up to 20 kHz. This report does not produce any experimental evidence as to the importance of the high frequency region from the subjective point of view, or to the correlation of the subjective impression of reverberation of the plates with measured data of early decay times, as these aspects were not addressed at this point.},

abstract={When the standard classical guitar is scaled up a musical fourth to a treble guitar, down a musical fifth to a baritone guitar, and down an octave to a bass guitar, design compromises are necessary to maintain playability and favourable tone qulality. The resulting instruments exhibit interesting natural vibration mode and sound radiation physics. The tone qualities of the new instruments suggest relations between the guitar response envelope and human sound perception. Translating the principle natural modes of the guitar up or down with string frequencies does not necessarily produce pleasing tone qualities nor optimal playing dynamics. However, designing bracing configurations for both classical and folk baritone and bass guitars to maximise low frequency radiation eficiency does seem to produce new instruments of musical appeal, Frequency response records of standard and guitar family variants illustrate the physical behaviour of the difierent designs. Experience of musicians with the guitar family instruments indicates that creative new guitar territory is available.},

abstract={Despite citation counts from Google Scholar (GS), Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus being widely consulted by researchers and sometimes used in research evaluations, there is no recent or systematic evidence about the differences between them. In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93/////// %–96/////// %), far ahead of Scopus (35/////// %–77/////// %) and WoS (27/////// %–73/////// %). GS found nearly all the WoS (95/////// %) and Scopus (92/////// %) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48/////// %–65/////// %), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19/////// %–38/////// %), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage.},

abstract={Bibliometric methods are used in multiple ﬁelds for a variety of purposes, namely for research evaluation. Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier’s Scopus. The objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some ﬁeld, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. To do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in WoS (13,605 journals) and Scopus (20,346 journals) with Ulrich’s extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. These results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, WoS and Scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different ﬁelds, institutions, countries or languages. The bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientiﬁc output that are not covered in WoS or Scopus, such as ﬁeld-speciﬁc and national citation indexes.},

Our longitudinal comparison of eight data points between 2013 and 2015 shows a consistent and reasonably stable quarterly growth for both publications and citations across the three databases. This suggests that all three databases provide sufﬁcient stability of coverage to be used for more detailed cross-disciplinary comparisons. Our cross-disciplinary comparison of the three databases includes four key research metrics (publications, citations, h-index, and hI, annual, an annualised individual h-index) and ﬁve major disciplines (Humanities, Social Sciences, Engineering, Sciences and Life Sciences). We show that both the data source and the speciﬁc metrics used change the conclusions that can be drawn from cross-disciplinary comparisons.},

volume={98},
abstract={Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) are prominent citation services with distinct indexing mechanisms. Comprehensive knowledge about the growth patterns of these two citation services is lacking. We analyzed the development of citation counts in WoS and GS for two classic articles and 56 articles from diverse research ﬁelds, making a distinction between retroactive growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in mid-2005 and citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013) and actual growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013 and citation counts up to April 2013 measured in April 2013). One of the classic articles was used for a citation-by-citation analysis. Results showed that GS has substantially grown in a retroactive manner (median of 170 /////// % across articles), especially for articles that initially had low citations counts in GS as compared to WoS. Retroactive growth of WoS was small, with a median of 2 /////// % across articles. Actual growth percentages were moderately higher for GS than for WoS (medians of 54 vs. 41 /////// %). The citation-by-citation analysis showed that the percentage of citations being unique in WoS was lower for more recent citations (6.8 /////// % for citations from 1995 and later vs. 41 /////// % for citations from before 1995), whereas the opposite was noted for GS (57 vs. 33 /////// %). It is concluded that, since its inception, GS has shown substantial expansion, and that the majority of recent works indexed in WoS are now also retrievable via GS. A discussion is provided on quantity versus quality of citations, threats for WoS, weaknesses of GS, and implications for literature research and research evaluation.},

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientiﬁc papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag “good for teaching” do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag – if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is speciﬁcally scientiﬁcally oriented (“new ﬁnding”). The ﬁndings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact.},

abstract={Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

Key limitations include the mismatch between citing and cited documents, the deceptive display of three decimals that belies the real precision, and the absence of conﬁdence intervals. These are minor issues that are easily amended and should be corrected, but more substantive improvements are needed. There are indications that the scientiﬁc community seeks and needs better certiﬁcation of journal procedures to improve the quality of published science. Comprehensive certiﬁcation of editorial and review procedures could help ensure adequate procedures to detect duplicate and fraudulent submissions.},

title={Three options for citation tracking: Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science},
doi={10.1186/1742-5581-3-7},
groups={Bibliometry},
abstract={Background: Researchers turn to citation tracking to find the most influential articles for a particular topic and to see how often their own published papers are cited. For years researchers looking for this type of information had only one resource to consult: the Web of Science from Thomson Scientific. In 2004 two competitors emerged – Scopus from Elsevier and Google Scholar from Google. The research reported here uses citation analysis in an observational study examining these three databases; comparing citation counts for articles from two disciplines (oncology and condensed matter physics) and two years (1993 and 2003) to test the hypothesis that the different scholarly publication coverage provided by the three search tools will lead to different citation counts from each. Methods: Eleven journal titles with varying impact factors were selected from each discipline (oncology and condensed matter physics) using the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). All articles published in the selected titles were retrieved for the years 1993 and 2003, and a stratified random sample of articles was chosen, resulting in four sets of articles. During the week of November 7–12, 2005, the citation counts for each research article were extracted from the three sources. The actual citing references for a subset of the articles published in 2003 were also gathered from each of the three sources. Results: For oncology 1993 Web of Science returned the highest average number of citations, 45.3. Scopus returned the highest average number of citations (8.9) for oncology 2003. Web of Science returned the highest number of citations for condensed matter physics 1993 and 2003 (22.5 and 3.9 respectively). The data showed a significant difference in the mean citation rates between all pairs of resources except between Google Scholar and Scopus for condensed matter physics 2003. For articles published in 2003 Google Scholar returned the largest amount of unique citing material for oncology and Web of Science returned the most for condensed matter physics. Conclusion: This study did not identify any one of these three resources as the answer to all citation tracking needs. Scopus showed strength in providing citing literature for current (2003) oncology articles, while Web of Science produced more citing material for 2003 and 1993 condensed matter physics, and 1993 oncology articles. All three tools returned some unique material. Our data indicate that the question of which tool provides the most complete set of citing literature may depend on the subject and publication year of a given article.},

Starting from the fundamental equations of a damped, stlff string interacting with a nonlinear hammer, a numericalfinite difference scheme is derived,from which the time and spatial dependence of string displacement, velocity, and interactingforce between hammer and string, as well as theforce acting on the bridge, are computed in the time-domain. The strength of the model is illustrated by comparisons between measured and simulated piano tones. After this verification of the accuracy of the method, the model is used as a tool for systematically exploring the influence of string stiffness, relative strikin, position, and hammer-string mass ratio on string waveforms and spectra.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is the time domain modeling of a piano. We aim at explaining the vibratory and acoustical behavior of the piano, by taking into account the main elements that contribute to sound production. The soundboard is modeled as a bidimensional thick, orthotropic, heterogeneous, frequency dependant damped plate, using Reissner Mindlin equations. The vibroacoustics equations allow the soundboard to radiate into the surrounding air, in which we wish to compute the complete acoustical ﬁeld around the perfectly rigid rim. The soundboard is also coupled to the strings at the bridge, where they form a slight angle from the horizontal plane. Each string is modeled by a one dimensional damped system of equations, taking into account not only the transversal waves excited by the hammer, but also the stiﬀness thanks to shear waves, as well as the longitudinal waves arising from geometric nonlinearities. The hammer is given an initial velocity that projects it towards a choir of strings, before being repelled. The interacting force is a nonlinear function of the hammer compression. The ﬁnal piano model is a coupled system of partial diﬀerential equations, each of them exhibiting speciﬁc diﬃculties (nonlinear nature of the string system of equations, frequency dependant damping of the soundboard, great number of unknowns required for the acoustic propagation), in addition to couplings’ inherent diﬃculties.},

abstract={Fourier transform methods are used to analyze functions and data sets to provide frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of underlying oscillatory components. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods oﬀer speed advantages over evaluation of explicit integrals (EI) that deﬁne Fourier transforms. This paper compares frequency, amplitude, and phase accuracy of the two methods for well resolved peaks over a wide array of data sets including cosine series with and without random noise and a variety of physical data sets, including atmospheric CO2 concentrations, tides, temperatures, sound waveforms, and atomic spectra. The FFT uses MIT’s FFTW3 library. The EI method uses the rectangle method to compute the areas under the curve via complex math. Results support the hypothesis that EI methods are more accurate than FFT methods. Errors range from 5 to 10 times higher when determining peak frequency by FFT, 1.4 to 60 times higher for peak amplitude, and 6 to 10 times higher for phase under a peak. The ability to compute more accurate Fourier transforms has promise for improved data analysis in many ﬁelds, including more sensitive assessment of hypotheses in the environmental sciences related to CO2 concentrations and temperature. Other methods are available to address diﬀerent weaknesses in FFTs; however, the EI method always produces the most accurate output possible for a given data set. On the 2011 Lenovo ThinkPad used in this study, an EI transform on a 10,000 point data set took 31 seconds to complete. Source code (C) and Windows executable for the EI method are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/.},

abstract={Frequency estimation from discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefﬁcients of a rectangular windowed signal under the inﬂuence of additive white noise is a well studied problem in signal processing. In its simplest form, the process involves ﬁnding the spectral peaks. When higher frequency resolution is required, a frequency offset can be found from the interpolation of DFT coefﬁcients. However, most of the past researches focus on monotonic cisoid signals. In practical situations where multiple harmonics are present, the sidelobes from other harmonics interfere with the estimation of the harmonic being considered. In this case, windows with smaller sidelobes such as Hanning window are preferred over rectangular window. Given the increased mathematical complexity of Hanning window, analytical solution has not yet been available for DFT interpolation. In this paper, we derive an exact analytical solution of the estimated frequency from DFT interpolation of Hanning windowed signal. In experiments, we show that the new analytical solution is accurate for monotonic cisoid signal and can considerably reduce the effect of interharmonic interference as compared to previous rectangular windowed methods.},

abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become one of the most successful frameworks for unsupervised generative modeling. As GANs are difficult to train much research has focused on this. However, very little of this research has directly exploited gametheoretic techniques. We introduce Generative Adversarial Network Games (GANGs), which explicitly model a finite zero-sum game between a generator (G) and classifier (C) that use mixed strategies. The size of these games precludes exact solution methods, therefore we define resource-bounded best responses (RBBRs), and a resourcebounded Nash Equilibrium (RB-NE) as a pair of mixed strategies such that neither G or C can find a better RBBR. The RB-NE solution concept is richer than the notion of ‘local Nash equilibria’ in that it captures not only failures of escaping local optima of gradient descent, but applies to any approximate best response computations, including methods with random restarts. To validate our approach, we solve GANGs with the Parallel Nash Memory algorithm, which provably monotonically converges to an RB-NE. We compare our results to standard GAN setups, and demonstrate that our method deals well with typical GAN problems such as mode collapse, partial mode coverage and forgetting.},

abstract={Security is a critical concern around the world, whether it is the challenge of protecting ports, airports and other critical infrastructure, interdicting the illegal ﬂow of drugs, weapons and money, protecting endangered species, forests and ﬁsheries, suppressing urban crime or security in cyberspace. Unfortunately, limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times; instead, we must optimize the use of limited security resources. To that end, we founded the “security games” framework to build decision-aids for security agencies. Security games is a novel area of research that is based on computational and behavioral game theory, while also incorporating elements of AI planning under uncertainty and machine learning. We have deployed securitygames based decision aids for infrastructure security such as at the ports and ferry trafﬁc with the US coast guard (in the ports of New York, Boston, Los Angeles/Long Beach, Houston and others), for security of airports and air trafﬁc with the US Federal Air Marshals and the Los Angeles World Airport (LAX) police, and tested this framework for security of metro trains with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department. Moreover, recent work on “green security games” has led to testing our decision aids for protection of ﬁsheries with the US Coast Guard and protection of wildlife at sites in multiple countries, and opportunistic crime security games have focused on suppressing urban crime. This chapter will discuss applications of security games, and outline research challenges in security games including algorithms for scaling up security games as well as for handling signiﬁcant adversarial uncertainty and learning models of human adversary behaviors.},

author={Pérolat, Julien and Strub, Florian and Piot, Bilal and Pietquin, Olivier},
abstract={This paper addresses the problem of learning a Nash equilibrium in γ-discounted multiplayer general-sum Markov Games (MGs) in a batch setting. As the number of players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase their ﬁnal rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to ﬁnd a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov Games. In this paper, we introduce a new deﬁnition of ǫ-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy’s quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellmanlike residuals implies to learn such an ǫ-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the Lp norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium in generic multiplayer generalsum turn-based MGs.},

abstract={In this chapter, we build on the concept of a repeated game discussed in Chap. Repeated Games and introduce the notion of a multistage game. In both types of games, several antagonistic agents interact with each other over time. The difference is that, in a multistage game, there is a dynamic system whose state keeps changing: the controls chosen by the agents in the current period affect the system’s future. In contrast with repeated games, the agents’ payoffs in multistage games depend directly on the state of this system. Examples of such settings range from a microeconomic dynamic model of a ﬁsh biomass exploited by several agents to a macroeconomic interaction between the government and the business sector. In some multistage games, physically different decisionmakers engage in simultaneous-move competition. In others, agents execute their actions sequentially rather than simultaneously. We also study hierarchical games, where a leader moves ahead of a follower. This chapter concludes with an example of memory-based strategies that can support Pareto-efﬁcient outcomes.},

abstract={The assumption of game theory is that the players in game must be rational. In the game of incomplete information, participants are not completely clear about the game. Therefore, usually there is a probability distribution of strategy selection in game. It is very complicated to know the real game information of the social and economic problems. In fact, the actual situation for many problems is that game players are irrational, or the probability distribution of game players’ strategies cannot be gotten, even the strategy sets are not complete (infinite strategy sets).There are many limitations in application of the traditional game theory. In this paper, the concept of complex information game and its Nash equilibrium are presented. It is proved that the complex information game problem can be solved by artificial neural network. An example on how to solve the complex information game problem with artificial neural network is given as well. Researchers hope that more and more scholars can use artificial intelligence theory to analyze the game theory problem. Therefore, the complex information game problems can be dealt more efficiently.},

We apply BAM to finite-strategy two-player games, and show that network activation in the long run is restricted to the set of rationalizable strategies. The network is not guaranteed to reach a stable activation state, but any pure strategy profile that constitutes a stable state in the network must be a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.},

abstract={Humans and animals face decision tasks in an uncertain multi-agent environment where an agent’s strategy may change in time due to the co-adaptation of others strategies. The neuronal substrate and the computational algorithms underlying such adaptive decision making, however, is largely unknown. We propose a population coding model of spiking neurons with a policy gradient procedure that successfully acquires optimal strategies for classical game-theoretical tasks. The suggested population reinforcement learning reproduces data from human behavioral experiments for the blackjack and the inspector game. It performs optimally according to a pure (deterministic) and mixed (stochastic) Nash equilibrium, respectively. In contrast, temporal-difference(TD)-learning, covariance-learning, and basic reinforcement learning fail to perform optimally for the stochastic strategy. Spike-based population reinforcement learning, shown to follow the stochastic reward gradient, is therefore a viable candidate to explain automated decision learning of a Nash equilibrium in two-player games.},

In this paper, we apply this issue to a search-theoretic framework (posted-price market) where sellers are confronted with a population of imperfectly informed buyers and take one decision per period (posted prices) with no direct interactions between sellers. We focus on three different scenarios with varying buyers’ characteristics. For each of these scenarios, we quantitatively and qualitatively test whether the learned variable (price strategy) converges to the Nash equilibrium. We also study the impact of the temperature parameter (deﬁning the exploitation/exploration trade off) on these results.},

The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the ﬁrst algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game.

The train- ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D; a unique solution exists; with G recovering the training data distribution andD equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G andD are defined by multilayer perceptrons; the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training or generation of samples.

title={Algebraic Extensions for Symbolic Summation},
langid={english},
institution={Johannes Kepler University Linz},
type={phdthesis},
abstract={The main result of this thesis is an eﬀective method to extend Karr’s symbolic summation framework to algebraic extensions. These arise, for example, when working with expressions involving (−1)n. An implementation of this method, including a modernised version of Karr’s algorithm is also presented. Karr’s algorithm is the summation analogue of the Risch algorithm for indeﬁnite integration. In the summation case, towers of specialized diﬀerence ﬁelds called ΠΣ-ﬁelds are used to model nested sums and products. This is similar to the way elementary functions involving nested logarithms and exponentials are represented in diﬀerential ﬁelds in the integration case. In contrast to the integration framework, only transcendental extensions are allowed in Karr’s construction. Algebraic extensions of ΠΣ-ﬁelds can even be rings with zero divisors. Karr’s methods rely heavily on the ability to solve ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerence equations and they are no longer applicable over these rings. Based on Bronstein’s formulation of a method used by Singer for the solution of diﬀerential equations over algebraic extensions, we transform a ﬁrst-order linear equation over an algebraic extension to a system of ﬁrst-order equations over a purely transcendental extension ﬁeld. However, this domain is not necessarily a ΠΣ-ﬁeld. Using a structure theorem by Singer and van der Put, we reduce this system to a single ﬁrst-order equation over a ΠΣ-ﬁeld, which can be solved by Karr’s algorithm. We also describe how to construct towers of diﬀerence ring extensions on an algebraic extension, where the same reduction methods can be used. A common bottleneck for symbolic summation algorithms is the computation of nullspaces of matrices over rational function ﬁelds. We present a fast algorithm for matrices over Q(x) which uses fast arithmetic at the hardware level with calls to BLAS subroutines after modular reduction. This part is joint work with Arne Storjohann.},

An interpolant constructed in this way does not require solving a system of linear equations as many approaches do. However there are vanishing tangent vectors at the interpolating points. By blending with a Bezier curve using the data points as the control points, the blended curve is a proper smooth interpolant. The blending factor has the effect similar to the "tension" control of tension splines. Piecewise interpolants can be constructed in an analogous way as a connection of Bezier curve segments to achieve C 1 continuity at the connecting points. Smooth interpolating surface patches can also be defined by blending sinusoidal polynomial tensor surfaces and Bezier tensor surfaces. The interpolant can very efficiently be evaluated by tabulating the sinusoidal function.},

The former would be used where large gradients are not encountered because of the smaller amount of calculation required. The latter would be used if the data being smoothed were double valued or experienced large gradients. Both algorithms use a least-squares technique to obtain a cubic spline fit to the data. The advantage of the spline fit is that the first and second derivatives are continuous. This method is best used in an interactive graphics environment so that the junction values for the spline curve can be manipulated to improve the fit.},

abstract={Recent research in economic geography has emphasized tacit knowledge as the basis of industrial learning. In contrast, codification and the practices of industrial writing have received little attention for the roles they play in mobilizing knowledge across space. This paper offers insight into the geographies of codification through an examination of technology transfer in the electronic musical instrument industry between 1965 and 1995. The research draws on a variety of primary and secondary data that include interviews with inventors, biographical accounts and patent analysis. These sources offer perspective on the career trajectories of three U.S. inventors who transferred knowledge from various contexts in California's high-tech industry to the Japanese firm, Yamaha. Conceptually, the paper draws on the actor–network theory and Latour's idea of translation to highlight the detours inventors must take to register novelty. The analysis reveals the problematic nature of codified knowledge and its transfer; in this case codified knowledge was mobile internationally but not locally, at least until it reached Japan. The paper argues for the need to understand how texts such as patents are produced—the context of their authorship, the geographies of their circulation and their efficacy for shaping further innovative practice.},

abstract={Driven by recent computer vision and robotic applications, recovering 3D human poses has become increasingly important and attracted growing interests. In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions.},

abstract={This dissertation proposes an interdisciplinary approach for the study of the timbre of the classical guitar. We start by identifying the static control parameters of timbre, relating to the structural components of the guitar and the dynamic control parameters of timbre, relating to the gestures applied by the performer on the instrument. From the plucked string physical model (obtained from the tranverse wave equation), we derive a digital signal interpretation of the plucking eﬀect which is a comb ﬁltering. Then we investigate how subjective characteristics of sound, like timbre, are related to gesture parameters. The starting point for exploration is an inventory of verbal descriptors commonly used by professional musicians to describe the brightness, the colour, the shape and the texture of the sounds they produce on their instruments. An explanation for the voice-like nature of guitar tones is proposed based on the observation that the maxima of the comb-ﬁltershaped magnitude spectrum of guitar tones are located at frequencies similar to the formant frequencies of a subset of identiﬁable vowels. These analogies at the spectral level might account for the origin of some timbre descriptors such as open, oval, round, thin, closed, nasal and hollow, that seem to refer to phonetic gestures. In a experiment conducted to conﬁrm these analogies, participants were asked to associate a consonant to the attack and a vowel to the decay of guitar tones. The results of this study support the idea that some perceptual dimensions of the guitar timbre space can be borrowed from phonetics. Finally, we address the problem of the indirect acquisition of instrumental gesture parameters. Pursuing previous research on the estimation of the plucking position from a recording, we propose a new estimation method based on an iterative weighted least-square algorithm, starting from a ﬁrst approximation derived from a variant of the autocorrelation function of the signal.},

abstract={The paper presents a new reinforcement learning mechanism for spiking neural networks. The algorithm is derived for networks of stochastic integrate-and-ﬁre neurons, but it can be also applied to generic spiking neural networks. Learning is achieved by synaptic changes that depend on the ﬁring of pre- and postsynaptic neurons, and that are modulated with a global reinforcement signal. The efﬁcacy of the algorithm is veriﬁed in a biologically-inspired experiment, featuring a simulated worm that searches for food. Our model recovers a form of neural plasticity experimentally observed in animals, combining spiketiming-dependent synaptic changes of one sign with nonassociative synaptic changes of the opposite sign determined by presynaptic spikes. The model also predicts that the time constant of spike-timing-dependent synaptic changes is equal to the membrane time constant of the neuron, in agreement with experimental observations in the brain. This study also led to the discovery of a biologicallyplausible reinforcement learning mechanism that works by modulating spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a global reward signal.},

abstract={Intelligence pertains to the ability to make appropriate decisions in light of specific goals and to adapt behavior to meet those goals in a range of environments. Mathematical games provide a framework for studying intelligent behavior in models of real-world settings or restricted domains. The behavior of alternative strategies in these games is defined by each individual’s stimulus-response mapping. Limiting these behaviors to linear functions of the environmental conditions renders the results to be little more than a façade: Effective decision making in any complex environment almost always requires nonlinear stimulus-response mappings. The obstacle then comes in choosing the appropriate representation and learning algorithm. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms provide useful means for addressing these issues. This paper describes efforts to hybridize neural and evolutionary computation to learn appropriate strategies in zeroand nonzero-sum games, including the iterated prisoner’s dilemma, tic-tac-toe, and checkers. With respect to checkers, the evolutionary algorithm was able to discover a neural network that can be used to play at a near-expert level without injecting expert knowledge about how to play the game. The implications of evolutionary learning with respect to machine intelligence are also discussed. It is argued that evolution provides the framework for explaining naturally occurring intelligent entities and can be used to design machines that are also capable of intelligent behavior.},

A linear time algorithm for the 1-median problem on a tree is described. We also present a classical formulation of the problem. Basic construction and improvement algorithms are outlined. Results from the literature using various metaheuristics including tabu search, heuristic concentration, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing are summarized. A Lagrangian relaxation approach is presented and used for computational results on 40 classical test instances as well as a 500-node instance derived from the most populous counties in the contiguous United States.

abstract={We propose a modiﬁcation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that generate illustrations of human ﬁgures from given poses represented by stick ﬁgures. In recent years, while various methods that generate images of characters using GANs have been proposed, it is not yet possible for users to freely designate poses of human ﬁgures. When generating an image of a character, the pose of the character takes is an important component of its composition. Thus it is necessary fora user who wants to create an illustration to be able to specify the pose easily. We collected a set of illustrations of human ﬁgures from the internet, and for each illustration, a simple line drawing that speciﬁes the pose was drawn manually. We constructed a GAN that takes a line drawing as its input and creates an illustration of a person in a pose that matches the line drawing. These networks are learned using the data set we prepared. In this paper, we propose a new network architecture. After constructing two networks both of which have almost the same structure as pix2pix, which is a variant model of GANs, we stack up those networks based on the idea of stack GAN. The experimental results show that, from stick ﬁgures representing common poses such as a standing pose, our methods was able to successfully generate images of characters. However, in the case of stick ﬁgures having rare poses that were not in the dataset, such as ﬁgures raising a hand or lying down, the generated images were blurred and not of a high-quality but still had the desired shapes. By expanding the dataset to include various poses, it is possible to generate diverse poses more precisely.},

abstract={In big data ﬁelds, with increasing computing capability, artiﬁcial neural networks have shown great strength in solving data classiﬁcation and regression problems. The traditional training of neural networks depends generally on the error back propagation method to iteratively tune all the parameters. When the number of hidden layers increases, this kind of training has many problems such as slow convergence, time consuming, and local minima. To avoid these problems, neural networks with random weights (NNRW) are proposed in which the weights between the hidden layer and input layer are randomly selected and the weights between the output layer and hidden layer are obtained analytically. Researchers have shown that NNRW has much lower training complexity in comparison with the traditional training of feed-forward neural networks. This paper objectively reviews the advantages and disadvantages of NNRW model, tries to reveal the essence of NNRW, gives our comments and remarks on NNRW, and provides some useful guidelines for users to choose a mechanism to train a feed-forward neural network.},

title={Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machines},
abstract={3D human articulated pose recovery from monocular image sequences is very challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions, and also the human 3D pose is inherently ambiguous from the monocular imagery. It is thus critical to exploit rich spatial and temporal long-range dependencies among body joints for accurate 3D pose sequence prediction. Existing approaches usually manually design some elaborate prior terms and human body kinematic constraints for capturing structures, which are often insufficient to exploit all intrinsic structures and not scalable for all scenarios. In contrast, this paper presents a Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machine(RPSM) to automatically learn the image-dependent structural constraint and sequence-dependent temporal context by using a multi-stage sequential refinement. At each stage, our RPSM is composed of three modules to predict the 3D pose sequences based on the previously learned 2D pose representations and 3D poses: (i) a 2D pose module extracting the image-dependent pose representations, (ii) a 3D pose recurrent module regressing 3D poses and (iii) a feature adaption module serving as a bridge between module (i) and (ii) to enable the representation transformation from 2D to 3D domain. These three modules are then assembled into a sequential prediction framework to refine the predicted poses with multiple recurrent stages. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M dataset and HumanEva-I dataset show that our RPSM outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches for 3D pose estimation.},

abstract={Three important properties of a classiﬁcation machinery are: (i) the system preserves the core information of the input data; (ii) the training examples convey information about unseen data; and (iii) the system is able to treat differently points from different classes. In this work we show that these fundamental properties are satisﬁed by the architecture of deep neural networks. We formally prove that these networks with random Gaussian weights perform a distance-preserving embedding of the data, with a special treatment for in-class and out-of-class data. Similar points at the input of the network are likely to have a similar output. The theoretical analysis of deep networks here presented exploits tools used in the compressed sensing and dictionary learning literature, thereby making a formal connection between these important topics. The derived results allow drawing conclusions on the metric learning properties of the network and their relation to its structure, as well as providing bounds on the required size of the training set such that the training examples would represent faithfully the unseen data. The results are validated with state-of-the-art trained networks.},

abstract={Deep neural networks are currently among the most commonly used classiﬁers. Despite easily achieving very good performance, one of the best selling points of these models is their modular design – one can conveniently adapt their architecture to speciﬁc needs, change connectivity patterns, attach specialised layers, experiment with a large amount of activation functions, normalisation schemes and many others. While one can ﬁnd impressively wide spread of various conﬁgurations of almost every aspect of the deep nets, one element is, in authors’ opinion, underrepresented – while solving classiﬁcation problems, vast majority of papers and applications simply use log loss. In this paper we try to investigate how particular choices of loss functions aﬀect deep models and their learning dynamics, as well as resulting classiﬁers robustness to various eﬀects. We perform experiments on classical datasets, as well as provide some additional, theoretical insights into the problem. In particular we show that L1 and L2 losses are, quite surprisingly, justiﬁed classiﬁcation objectives for deep nets, by providing probabilistic interpretation in terms of expected misclassiﬁcation. We also introduce two losses which are not typically used as deep nets objectives and show that they are viable alternatives to the existing ones.},

abstract={The stochastic knapsack problem is a stochastic resource allocation problem that arises frequently and yet is exceptionally hard to solve. We derive and study an optimistic planning algorithm speciﬁcally designed for the stochastic knapsack problem. Unlike other optimistic planning algorithms for MDPs, our algorithm, OpStoK, avoids the use of discounting and is adaptive to the amount of resources available. We achieve this behavior by means of a concentration inequality that simultaneously applies to capacity and reward estimates. Crucially, we are able to guarantee that the aforementioned conﬁdence regions hold collectively over all time steps by an application of Doob’s inequality. We demonstrate that the method returns an -optimal solution to the stochastic knapsack problem with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the ﬁrst which provides such guarantees for the stochastic knapsack problem. Furthermore, our algorithm is an anytime algorithm and will return a good solution even if stopped prematurely. This is particularly important given the diﬃculty of the problem. We also provide theoretical conditions to guarantee OpStoK does not expand all policies and demonstrate favorable performance in a simple experimental setting.},

title={Approximating the Stochastic Knapsack Problem: The Beneﬁt of Adaptivity},
abstract={We consider a stochastic variant of the NP-hard 0/1 knapsack problem in which item values are deterministic and item sizes are independent random variables with known, arbitrary distributions. Items are placed in the knapsack sequentially, and the act of placing an item in the knapsack instantiates its size. Our goal is to compute a solution “policy” that maximizes the expected value of items placed in the knapsack, and we consider both non-adaptive policies (that designate a priori a ﬁxed sequence of items to insert) and adaptive policies (that can make dynamic choices based on the instantiated sizes of items placed in the knapsack thus far). We show that adaptivity provides only a constant-factor improvement by demonstrating a greedy non-adaptive algorithm that approximates the optimal adaptive policy within a factor of 7. We also design an adaptive polynomial-time algorithm which approximates the optimal adaptive policy within a factor of 5 + , for any constant > 0.},

The commonly used accounting and financial tool for such classification and prediction is a multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) of financial ratios. But the MDA technique has limitations based on its assumptions of linear separability, multivariate normality, and independence of the predictive variableS. A neural network, being free from such constraining assumptions, is able to achieve superior results. Our neural network model is the Cascade-Correlation architecture recently developed by Scott E. Fahlman and Christian Lebiere at Carnegie Mellon University. This new approach solves the hidden architecture enigma encountered using other types of neural networks. Also, Cascade-Correlation manages error signals in a manner which significantly improves execution speed. Our research is the first to use Cascade-Correlation for corporate health estimation.},

journaltitle={Acta Informatica Medica},
abstract={Background and objective: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have recently been applied in situations where an analysis based on the logistic regression (LR) is a standard statistical approach; direct comparisons of the results, however, are seldom attempted. In this study, we compared both logistic regression models and feed-forward neural networks on the academic failure data set. Methods: The data for this study included 18 questions about study situation of 275 undergraduate students selected randomly from among nursing and midwifery and paramedic schools of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences in 2013. Logistic regression with forward method and feed forward Artificial Neural Network with 15 neurons in hidden layer were fitted to the dataset. The accuracy of the models in predicting academic failure was compared by using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and classification accuracy. Results: Among nine ANNs, the ANN with 15 neurons in hidden layer was a better ANN compared with LR. The Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of the LR model and ANN with 15 neurons in hidden layers, were estimated as 0.55 and 0.89, respectively and ANN was significantly greater than the LR. The LR and ANN models respectively classified 77.5///////\\% and 84.3///////\\% of the students correctly. Conclusion: Based on this dataset, it seems the classification of the students in two groups with and without academic failure by using ANN with 15 neurons in the hidden layer is better than the LR model.},

abstract={For a musical instrument sound containing partials, or modes, the behavior of modes around the attack time is particularly important. However, accurately decomposing it around the attack time is not an easy task, especially when the onset is sharp. This is because spectra of the modes are peaky while the sharp onsets need a broad one. In this paper, an optimization-based method of modal decomposition is proposed to achieve accurate decomposition around the attack time. The proposed method is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to enforce the perfect reconstruction property which is important for accurate decomposition. For optimization, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized, where the update of variables is calculated in closed form. The proposed method realizes accurate modal decomposition in the simulation and real piano sounds.},

Solving this task using only audio as input is extremely challenging and does not provide an association of the separated speech signals with speakers in the video. In this paper, we present a deep network-based model that incorporates both visual and auditory signals to solve this task. The visual features are used to "focus" the audio on desired speakers in a scene and to improve the speech separation quality. To train our joint audio-visual model, we introduce AVSpeech, a new dataset comprised of thousands of hours of video segments from the Web. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to classic speech separation tasks, as well as real-world scenarios involving heated interviews, noisy bars, and screaming children, only requiring the user to specify the face of the person in the video whose speech they want to isolate. Our method shows clear advantage over state-of-the-art audio-only speech separation in cases of mixed speech. In addition, our model, which is speaker-independent (trained once, applicable to any speaker), produces better results than recent audio-visual speech separation methods that are speaker-dependent (require training a separate model for each speaker of interest).},

abstract={Physical modelling is a sophisticated synthesis technique, often used in the design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Diﬀerence TimeDomain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of oﬀ-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a ﬁrst interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.},

abstract={We propose a practical method for L0 norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of L0 regularization. However, since the L0 norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected L0 norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the hard concrete distribution for the gates, which is obtained by “stretching” a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efﬁcient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

abstract={During the last decade, much attention has been given to sound rendering and the simulation of acoustic phenomena by solving appropriate models described by Hamiltonian partial differential equations. In this contribution, we introduce a procedure to develop appropriate tools inspired from geometric integration in order to simulate musical sounds. Geometric integrators are numerical integrators of excellent quality that are designed exclusively for Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations. The introduced procedure is a combination of two techniques in geometric integration: the semi-discretization method by Celledoni et al. (J Comput Phys 231:6770–6789, 2012) and symplectic partitioned Runge–Kutta methods. This combination turns out to be a right procedure that derives numerical schemes that are effective and suitable for computation of musical sounds. By using this procedure we derive a series of explicit integration algorithms for a simple model describing piano sounds as a representative example for virtual instruments. We demonstrate the advantage of the numerical methods by evaluating a variety of numerical test cases.},

@article{2016JaderbergDecoupled,
abstract={Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one’s future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass – amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

In particular, we consider the range-limited approximation of linking by intermediations in a few hops, and show the strong robustness in the growth without degrading eﬃciency of paths. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tolerance of connectivity is reformable even from extremely vulnerable real networks according to our proposed growing process with some investment.

In the field of computer music, the term “virtual musical instruments” has been used for a long time to describe software simulations, extensions of existing musical instruments, and ways to control them with new interfaces for musical expression. Virtual reality musical instruments (VRMIs) that include a simulated visual component delivered via a head-mounted display or other forms of immersive visualization have not yet received much attention. In this article, we present a field overview of VRMIs from the viewpoint of the performer. We propose nine design guidelines, describe evaluation methods, analyze case studies, and consider future challenges.},

title={How Important Is Weight Symmetry in Backpropagation?},
langid={english},
abstract={Gradient backpropagation (BP) requires symmetric feedforward and feedback connections—the same weights must be used for forward and backward passes. This “weight transport problem” (Grossberg 1987) is thought to be one of the main reasons to doubt BP’s biologically plausibility. Using 15 different classiﬁcation datasets, we systematically investigate to what extent BP really depends on weight symmetry. In a study that turned out to be surprisingly similar in spirit to Lillicrap et al.’s demonstration (Lillicrap et al. 2014) but orthogonal in its results, our experiments indicate that: (1) the magnitudes of feedback weights do not matter to performance (2) the signs of feedback weights do matter—the more concordant signs between feedforward and their corresponding feedback connections, the better (3) with feedback weights having random magnitudes and 100 /\\% concordant signs, we were able to achieve the same or even better performance than SGD. (4) some normalizations/stabilizations are indispensable for such asymmetric BP to work, namely Batch Normalization (BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) and/or a “Batch Manhattan” (BM) update rule.},

abstract={We describe an image compression method, consisting of a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear ﬁlters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate–distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate–distortion curve, as speciﬁed by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we ﬁnd that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate–distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.},

urldate={2019-03-26},
eprint={1601.06815},
abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently state-of-the-art for various classiﬁcation tasks, but are computationally expensive. Propagating through the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer must sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward propagation which equates to O(N2n2) per kernel per layer where the inputs are N × N arrays and the kernels are n × n arrays. Convolution can be efﬁciently performed as a Hadamard product in the frequency domain. The bottleneck is the transformation which has a cost of O(N2 log2 N) using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, the increase in efﬁciency is less signiﬁcant when N n as is the case in CNNs. We mitigate this by using the “overlap-and-add” technique reducing the computational complexity to O(N2 log2 n) per kernel. This method increases the algorithm’s efﬁciency in both the forward and backward propagation, reducing the training and testing time for CNNs. Our empirical results show our method reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16.3 times the traditional convolution implementation for a 8 × 8 kernel and a 224 × 224 image.},

urldate={2019-03-26},

abstract={An important class of problems involves training deep neural networks with sparse prediction targets of very high dimension D. These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efﬁcient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d2) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output.

title={On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder Approaches},
abstract={Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a ﬁxed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder–Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

Our ﬁndings suggest that adolescents with music training have better school grades, are more conscientious, open and ambitious. These effects are stronger among adolescents from lower socio-economic status. In order to address the non-random selection into playing music, we take into account detailed information on the child and its parents, which may determine both the decision to pursue music lessons and educational outcomes. While lacking truly exogenous variations in music activities, our results are robust to a large range of sensitivity tests. We thereby approach causality better than previous observational studies.},

abstract={Collisions are an innate part of the function of many musical instruments. Due to the nonlinear nature of contact forces, special care has to be taken in the construction of numerical schemes for simulation and sound synthesis. Finite difference schemes and other time-stepping algorithms used for musical instrument modelling purposes are normally arrived at by discretising a Newtonian description of the system. However because impact forces are nonanalytic functions of the phase space variables, algorithm stability can rarely be established this way. This paper presents a systematic approach to deriving energy conserving schemes for frictionless impact modelling. The proposed numerical formulations follow from discretising Hamilton's equations of motion, generally leading to an implicit system of nonlinear equations that can be solved with Newton's method. The approach is first outlined for point mass collisions and then extended to distributed settings, such as vibrating strings and beams colliding with rigid obstacles. Stability and other relevant properties of the proposed approach are discussed and further demonstrated with simulation examples. The methodology is exemplified through a case study on tanpura string vibration, with the results confirming the main findings of previous studies on the role of the bridge in sound generation with this type of string instrument.},

abstract={Background: The purpose of this investigation was to compare empirically predictive ability of an artificial neural network with a logistic regression in prediction of low back pain. Methods: Data from the second national health survey were considered in this investigation. This data includes the information of low back pain and its associated risk factors among Iranian people aged 15 years and older. Artificial neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a set of 17294 data and they were validated in a test set of 17295 data. Hosmer and Lemeshow recommendation for model selection was used in fitting the logistic regression. A three-layer perceptron with 9 inputs, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons was employed. The efficiency of two models was compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, root mean square and -2 Loglikelihood criteria. Results: The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the logistic regression was 0.752 (0.004), 0.3832 and 14769.2, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the artificial neural network was 0.754 (0.004), 0.3770 and 14757.6, respectively. Conclusions: Based on these three criteria, artificial neural network would give better performance than logistic regression. Although, the difference is statistically significant, it does not seem to be clinically significant.},

abstract={Multiplicative noise (also known as speckle noise) models are central to the study of coherent imaging systems, such as synthetic aperture radar and sonar, and ultrasound and laser imaging. These models introduce two additional layers of difﬁculties with respect to the standard Gaussian additive noise scenario: (1) the noise is multiplied by (rather than added to) the original image; (2) the noise is not Gaussian, with Rayleigh and Gamma being commonly used densities. These two features of multiplicative noise models preclude the direct application of most state-of-the-art algorithms, which are designed for solving unconstrained optimization problems where the objective has two terms: a quadratic data term (log-likelihood), reﬂecting the additive and Gaussian nature of the noise, plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer (e.g., a total variation or wavelet-based regularizer/prior). In this paper, we address these difﬁculties by: (1) converting the multiplicative model into an additive one by taking logarithms, as proposed by some other authors; (2) using variable splitting to obtain an equivalent constrained problem; and (3) dealing with this optimization problem using the augmented Lagrangian framework. A set of experiments shows that the proposed method, which we name MIDAL (multiplicative image denoising by augmented Lagrangian), yields state-of-the-art results both in terms of speed and denoising performance.},

This acoustic model describes the propagation of longitudinal waves in axisymmetric acoustic pipes with a varying cross-section, visco-thermal losses at the walls, and without assuming planar or spherical waves. Moreover, three types of discontinuities of the shape can be taken into account (radius, slope, and curvature). The purpose of this work is to build low-cost digital simulations in the time domain based on the Webster–Lokshin model. First, decomposing a resonator into independent elementary parts and isolating delay operators lead to a Kelly–Lochbaum network of input/output systems and delays. Second, for a systematic assembling of elements, their state–space representations are derived in discrete time. Then, standard tools of automatic control are used to reduce the complexity of digital simulations in the time domain. The method is applied to a real trombone, and results of simulations are presented and compared with measurements. This method seems to be a promising approach in term of modularity, complexity of calculation, and accuracy, for any acoustic resonators based on tubes.},

abstract={When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the eﬀects of latency (020ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present ﬁndings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms ± 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was signiﬁcantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the timing performance of our participants. These ﬁndings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

abstract={The one-dimensional digital waveguides, combined with the commuted synthesis method, allow modeling and high-quality synthesis of plucked string instrument tones in a very eﬃcient manner. However, the increasing computational power of the modern processors makes it feasible to experiment with more complex algorithms also for real-time sound synthesis purposes. By certain simpliﬁcations, time-domain methods based on ﬁnite diﬀerences (FDTD) are eﬃcient enough to run in real time on modern processors and yet they are more ﬂexible than the computationally less expensive commuted synthesis. The resulting structures, which are called 1-D FDTD waveguides, have previously been shown to be equal to or to approximate many properties of digital waveguides, including lossless and lossy propagation, input and output ports, terminations, and scattering junctions. The numerical stability of the 1-D FDTD waveguides, as well as their initialization and formation of the traveling waves are well understood. However, a careful comparison between 1-D FDTD waveguides and conventional digital waveguides in terms of their limitations, computational eﬃciency, accuracy, and interaction has not been carried out. The aim of this paper is to ﬁll this gap by highlighting important properties of both methods side by side in string instrument modeling and synthesis. We then try to combine the best properties of both methods and discuss the interaction of the two model structures. Synthetic tones and short musical phrases obtained by both synthesis models will be demonstrated during the presentation. These sound examples will also be available at http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/demos/.},

A continuity-restoration block takes the extracted pitch and determines the score corresponding to the original performance. The signal envelope analysis completes the transcription system, calculating attack-sustain-decay-release times, which improves the synthesis process. Attention is also paid to the extraction of timbre and wavetable synthesis.},

abstract={Use of a bilinear conformal map to achieve a frequency warping nearly identical to that of the Bark frequency scale is described. Because the map takes the unit circle to itself, its form is that of the transfer function of a ﬁrst-order allpass ﬁlter. Since it is a ﬁrst-order map, it preserves the model order of rational systems, making it a valuable frequency warping technique for use in audio ﬁlter design. A closed-form weighted-equation-error method is derived which computes the optimal mapping coeﬃcient as a function of sampling rate, and the solution is shown to be generally indistinguishable from the optimal least-squares solution. The optimal Chebyshev mapping is also found to be essentially identical to the optimal least-squares solution. The expression 0.8517*sqrt(atan(0.06583*Fs))-0.1916 is shown to accurately approximate the optimal allpass coeﬃcient as a function of sampling rate Fs in kHz for sampling rates greater than 1 kHz. A ﬁlter design example is included which illustrates improvements due to carrying out the design over a Bark scale. Corresponding results are also given and compared for approximating the related “equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) scale” of Moore and Glasberg using a ﬁrst-order allpass transformation. Due to the higher frequency resolution called for by the ERB scale, particularly at low frequencies, the ﬁrst-order conformal map is less able to follow the desired mapping, and the error is two to three times greater than the Bark-scale case, depending on the sampling rate.},

Though this analysis/synthesis system has proved to be successful in transforming sounds, more powerful and intuitive musical transformations can be achieved by moving into the SMS high-level attribute plane. In this paper we describe how to extract high level sound attributes from the basic representation, modify them, and add them back before the synthesis stage. In this process new problems come up for which we propose some initial solutions.},

abstract={A method based on the Fourier convolution theorem is developed for the analysis of data composed of random noise, plus an unknown constant "base line," plus a sum of (or an integral over a continuous spectrum of) exponential decay functions. The Fourier method's usual serious practical limitation of needing high accuracy data over a very wide time range is eliminated by the introduction of convergence parameters and a Gaussian taper window. A computer program is described for the analysis of discrete spectra, where the data involves only a sum of exponentials. The program is completely automatic in that the only necessary inputs are the raw data (not necessarily in equal intervals of time); no potentially biased initial guesses concerning either the number or the values of the components are needed. The outputs include the number of components, the amplitudes and time constants together with their estimated errors, and a spectral plot of the solution. The limiting resolving power of the method is studied by analyzing a wide range of simulated two-, three-, and four-component data. The results seem to indicate that the method is applicable over a considerably wider range of conditions than nonlinear least squares or the method of moments.},

The research is built upon daily CDS spreads of 40 international banks for the period from June 2007 to March 2010, i.e. at the heart of the global financial crisis. For this time period, 20 of the financial institutions received federal bailouts and are labeled as defaults while the remaining institutions are categorized as non-defaults. The employed multivariate pattern recognition approach represents a modification of the CORA3 algorithm. The approach is found to be robust regardless of reasonable changes of its inputs. Despite the fact that distinct alarm indices for banks do not clearly demonstrate predictive capabilities of the LPPL, the synchronized alarm indices confirm the multivariate discriminative power of LPPL patterns in CDS spread developments acknowledged by bootstrap intervals with 70 /\\% confidence level.},

These structures are well suited for efficient yet accurate simulation of wave propagation in an ideal membrane. Nevertheless, real membranes exhibit a different behaviour, due to the environmental conditions and to the material they are made of. In this work we consider some aspects, crucial for the audio signal, of the physical phenomena concerning real membranes, and we will develop a 2-D waveguide model encompassing the effects of these aspects. In order to excite the simulated membrane, we will consider a hammer model previously developed for piano strings, and here adapted to fit the hammer-membrane interaction.},

abstract={This article describes physical modelling techniques that can be used for simulating musical instruments. The methods are closely related to digital signal processing. They discretize the system with respect to time, because the aim is to run the simulation using a computer. The physics-based modelling methods can be classiﬁed as mass–spring, modal, wave digital, ﬁnite difference, digital waveguide and source–ﬁlter models. We present the basic theory and a discussion on possible extensions for each modelling technique. For some methods, a simple model example is chosen from the existing literature demonstrating a typical use of the method. For instance, in the case of the digital waveguide modelling technique a vibrating string model is discussed, and in the case of the wave digital ﬁlter technique we present a classical piano hammer model. We tackle some nonlinear and time-varying models and include new results on the digital waveguide modelling of a nonlinear string. Current trends and future directions in physical modelling of musical instruments are discussed.},

title={Numerical Modeling of Collisions in Musical Instruments},
eprint={1405.2589},
urldate={2019-03-28},
abstract={Collisions play an important role in many aspects of the physics of musical instruments. The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and percussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others include reed-beating eﬀects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction in fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the wire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective, whether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or sound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various diﬃculties, not the least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a novel ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain simulation framework for such collision problems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical energy conservation or dissipation, and where a a power law formulation for collisions is employed, as a potential function within a Hamiltonian formulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and as a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. This formulation solves a major problem underlying previous work, where a Hamiltonian framework was not employed for collisions, and thus stability was not ensured. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of such methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are presented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation, bounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as various aspects of musical instrument physics.},

title={Efficient and accurate synthesis of circular membranes using digital waveguides},
abstract={Digital waveguides may be used to construct efficient physical models of musical instruments and other resonant systems. They are commonly used to model systems with simple boundary - conditions, such as strings and square membranes. Membranes are modelled by connecting digital waveguides together to form a mesh; however when modelling circular membranes, such as those found in percussive drums or microphones, the mesh does not approximate well to the boundary shape. It was found that a two-dimensional triangular mesh structure, with rimguides attached around the edge could overcome this. In this paper several rimguide strategies have been explored. The best of these involves adjusting the phase delay so that the model is accurate for frequencies close to DC. The improvement is particularly noticeable for efficient (low sample rate) implementations.},

The paper applies recent developments in piano modeling and focuses on the issues related to practical implementation (e.g., numerical stability, aliasing, and efﬁciency). A strong emphasis is given to modeling nonlinear string vibrations, and a new variation of earlier synthesis techniques is proposed which is particularly well suited for modal synthesis. For soundboard modeling, the possibilities of using FFT-based fast convolution and parallel second-order ﬁlters are discussed. Additionally, the paper describes the details of the software implementation and discusses the computational complexity of each model block. The piano model runs on current computer hardware with full polyphony in real time.},

Recently, the interest for passive underwater context increased, basically due to the richness of the information carried out by the natural signals. Taken into account the non-linear multi-component time-frequency behavior of such signals, their analysis is a complex problem. In this paper we introduce a new time-frequency analysis concept that aims to extract the non-linear timefrequency components. The main feature of this technique is the joint use of time-amplitude, time-frequency and timephase information. This is materialized by a short-time polynomial phase modeling and the fusion of local information according to the best locally matches of local cubic frequency modulations. Tests provided on real data illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach.},

abstract={To achieve general intelligence, agents must learn how to interact with others in a shared environment: this is the challenge of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). The simplest form is independent reinforcement learning (InRL), where each agent treats its experience as part of its (non-stationary) environment. In this paper, we ﬁrst observe that policies learned using InRL can overﬁt to the other agents’ policies during training, failing to sufﬁciently generalize during execution. We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle, and ﬁctitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings: gridworld coordination games and poker.},

abstract={We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of generalsum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (deﬁned by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the ﬁrst grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of ofﬂine learning performance in both games, we ﬁnd agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.},

@book{2014KamlerHelping,
edition={Second edition},
abstract={"Helping Doctoral Students Write offers a proven approach to effective doctoral writing. By treating research as writing and writing as research, the authors offer pedagogical strategies for doctoral supervisors that will assist the production of well-argued and lively dissertations. It is clear that many doctoral candidates find research writing complicated and difficult, but the advice they receive often glosses over the complexities of writing and/or locates the problem in the writer. Kamler and Thomson provide a highly effective framework for scholarly work that is located in personal, institutional and cultural contexts. The pedagogical approach developed in the book is based on the notion of writing as a social practice. This approach allows supervisors to think of doctoral writers as novices who need to learn new ways with words as they enter the discursive practices of scholarly communities. This involves learning sophisticated writing practices with specific sets of conventions and textual characteristics.

abstract={Traditionally the emphasis in neural network research has been on improving their performance as a means of pattern recognition. Here we take an alternative approach and explore the remarkable similarity between the under-performance of neural networks trained to behave optimally in economic situations and observed human performance in the laboratory under similar circumstances. In particular, we show that neural networks are consistent with observed laboratory play in two very important senses. Firstly, they select a rule for behavior which appears very similar to that used by laboratory subjects. Secondly, using this rule they perform optimally only approximately 60 /\\% of the time.},

@article{SpiliopoulosLearning,
pages={10},
abstract={This paper addresses the question of whether neural networks (NNs), a realistic cognitive model of human information processing, can learn to backward induce in a two-stage game with a unique subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. The NNs were found to predict the Nash equilibrium approximately 70 /\\% of the time in new games. Similarly to humans, the neural network agents are also found to suffer from subgame and truncation inconsistency, supporting the contention that they are appropriate models of general learning in humans. The agents were found to behave in a bounded rational manner as a result of the endogenous emergence of decision heuristics. In particular a very simple heuristic socialmax, that chooses the cell with the highest social payoff explains their behavior approximately 60 /\\% of the time, whereas the ownmax heuristic that simply chooses the cell with the maximum payoff for that agent fares worse explaining behavior roughly 38 /\\%, albeit still signiﬁcantly better than chance. These two heuristics were found to be ecologically valid for the backward induction problem as they predicted the Nash equilibrium in 67 /\\% and 50 /\\% of the games respectively. Compared to various standard classiﬁcation algorithms, the NNs were found to be only slightly more accurate than standard discriminant analyses. However, the latter do not model the dynamic learning process and have an ad hoc postulated functional form. In contrast, a NN agent’s behavior evolves with experience and is capable of taking on any functional form according to the universal approximation theorem.},

In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against baselines using bag-of-words and bag-of-bigrams for state representations. Our algorithm outperforms the baselines on both worlds demonstrating the importance of learning expressive representations.},

abstract={Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proﬁcient controllers for complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the ﬁrst post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN’s performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring ﬂickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN’s performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN’s performance degrades less than DQN’s. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN’s input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},

In this paper, we consider a continuous space security game model with inﬁnite-size action sets for players and present a novel deep learning based approach to extend the existing toolkit for solving security games. Specifically, we present (i) OptGradFP, a novel and general algorithm that searches for the optimal defender strategy in a parameterized continuous search space, and can also be used to learn policies over multiple game states simultaneously; (ii) OptGradFP-NN, a convolutional neural network based implementation of OptGradFP for continuous space security games. We demonstrate the potential to predict good defender strategies via experiments and analysis of OptGradFP and OptGradFP-NN on discrete and continuous game settings.},

abstract={The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma has guided research on social dilemmas for decades. However, it distinguishes between only two atomic actions: cooperate and defect. In real-world prisoner’s dilemmas, these choices are temporally extended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions, reﬂecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma (SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work, we propose a deep multiagent reinforcement learning approach that investigates the evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two phases. The ﬁrst phase is ofﬂine: it synthesizes policies with different cooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The second phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the detected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the ApplePear game and the Fruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid being exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with cooperative opponents.},

Results are presented from six tasks - eyelid conditioning, pendulum balancing, PID control, robot balancing, pattern recognition, and MNIST handwritten digit recognition. These tasks span several paradigms of machine learning including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, control, and pattern recognition. Results over these six domains indicate that cerebellar simulation is capable of robustly identifying static input patterns even when randomized across the sensory apparatus. This capability allows the simulated cerebellum to perform several different supervised learning and control tasks. On the other hand, reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition both prove problematic due to the delayed nature of error signals and the simulator’s inability to solve the credit assignment problem. These results are consistent with previous ﬁndings which hypothesize that in the human brain, the basal ganglia is responsible for reinforcement learning while the cerebellum handles supervised learning.},

abstract={Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efﬁciency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layerdeep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and signiﬁcant improvements on ImageNet.

In this paper, we introduce WaveGAN, a ﬁrst attempt at applying GANs to raw audio synthesis in an unsupervised setting. Our experiments on speech demonstrate that WaveGAN can produce intelligible words from a small vocabulary of human speech, as well as synthesize audio from other domains such as bird vocalizations, drums, and piano. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that human judges prefer the generated examples from WaveGAN over those from a method which na¨ıvely apply GANs on image-like audio feature representations.},

We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signiﬁcantly faster learning.

Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive ﬁeld. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classiﬁcation layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overﬁtting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classiﬁcation performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

In particular, we focus on RNNs that have a sophisticated gating mechanism, namely, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and the recently introduced Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Our results indicate that the generated outputs of the LSTM network were signiﬁcantly more musically plausible than those of the GRU.},

abstract={This paper evaluates k-fold and Monte Carlo cross-validation and aggregation (crogging) for combining neural network autoregressive forecasts. We introduce Monte Carlo crogging which combines bootstrapping and cross-validation (CV) in a single approach through repeated random splitting of the original time series into mutually exclusive datasets for training. As the training/validation split is independent of the number of folds, the algorithm offers more flexibility in the size, and number of training samples compared to k-fold cross-validation. The study also provides for crogging and bagging: (1) the first systematic evaluation across time series length and combination size, (2) a bias and variance decomposition of the forecast errors to understand improvement gains, and (3) a comparison to established benchmarks of model averaging and selection. Crogging can easily be extended to other autoregressive models. Results on real and simulated series demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy especially for short time series and long forecast horizons.},

abstract={Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets (i.e. ImageNet) and the revival of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, layered hierarchical image features from sufﬁcient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classiﬁcation: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised ﬁne-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., ﬁne-tuning CNN models (supervised) pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks (although domain transfer between two medical image datasets is also possible).},

abstract={Relatively small data sets available for expression recognition research make the training of deep networks for expression recognition very challenging. Although ﬁne-tuning can partially alleviate the issue, the performance is still below acceptable levels as the deep features probably contain redundant information from the pre-trained domain. In this paper, we present FaceNet2ExpNet, a novel idea to train an expression recognition network based on static images. We ﬁrst propose a new distribution function to model the high-level neurons of the expression network. Based on this, a two-stage training algorithm is carefully designed. In the pre-training stage, we train the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In the reﬁning stage, we append fullyconnected layers to the pre-trained convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly. Visualization shows that the model trained with our method captures improved high-level expression semantics. Evaluations on four public expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, TFD, and SFEW demonstrate that our method achieves better results than state-of-the-art.},

title={Investigating gated recurrent neural networks for speech synthesis},
abstract={Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as powerful sequence models have re-emerged as a potential acoustic model for statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS). The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can achieve signiﬁcantly better performance on SPSS than deep feedforward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e.g., input gate, output gate, forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simpliﬁed architecture. The simpliﬁed architecture has signiﬁcantly fewer parameters than an LSTM, thus reducing generation complexity considerably without degrading quality.},

While several topic speciﬁc survey papers have been written, to date no general survey on problems, datasets and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles exists. This paper attempts to narrow this gap by providing a state-of-the-art survey on this topic. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state-of-the-art on several speciﬁc topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding and end-to-end learning. Towards this goal, we ﬁrst provide a taxonomy to classify each approach and then analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarking datasets including KITTI, ISPRS, MOT and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we will also provide an interactive platform which allows to navigate topics and methods, and provides additional information and project links for each paper.},

abstract={Despite the success of CNNs, selecting the optimal architecture for a given task remains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture, we propose a “fabric” that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on backpropagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size. We present benchmark results competitive with the state of the art for image classiﬁcation on MNIST and CIFAR10, and for semantic segmentation on the Part Labels dataset.},

title={Peak-Piloted Deep Network for Facial Expression Recognition},
abstract={Objective functions for training of deep networks for face-related recognition tasks, such as facial expression recognition (FER), usually consider each sample independently. In this work, we present a novel peak-piloted deep network (PPDN) that uses a sample with peak expression (easy sample) to supervise the intermediate feature responses for a sample of non-peak expression (hard sample) of the same type and from the same subject. The expression evolving process from non-peak expression to peak expression can thus be implicitly embedded in the network to achieve the invariance to expression intensities. A specialpurpose back-propagation procedure, peak gradient suppression (PGS), is proposed for network training. It drives the intermediate-layer feature responses of non-peak expression samples towards those of the corresponding peak expression samples, while avoiding the inverse. This avoids degrading the recognition capability for samples of peak expression due to interference from their non-peak expression counterparts. Extensive comparisons on two popular FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and CK+, demonstrate the superiority of the PPDN over state-ofthe-art FER methods, as well as the advantages of both the network structure and the optimization strategy. Moreover, it is shown that PPDN is a general architecture, extensible to other tasks by proper deﬁnition of peak and non-peak samples. This is validated by experiments that show state-of-the-art performance on pose-invariant face recognition, using the Multi-PIE dataset.},

title={Stochastic weights binary neural networks on FPGA},
abstract={To achieve an advanced Internet of Things (IoT), it is necessary to combine artificial intelligence (AI) with IoT. Compact circuits that can operate AI functions will be useful for this purpose. Therefore, we propose stochastic weights binary neural networks (SWBNN). SWBNNs are more accurate than binary neural networks (BNN) with small circuits. BNNs can be realized with small circuits since binary calculation needs simpler circuits than real number calculation. However, BNNs have lower accuracy than networks with real numbers. Thus, the proposed SWBNNs are BNNs that behave stochastically, which makes them more accurate than BNNs. Moreover, SWBNNs can still be achieved with small circuits since they execute binary calculation. As a result, the accuracy for the test data of SWBNNs is closer to the accuracy for learning data than the accuracy for the test data of BNNs is. Especially when using the CIFAR10 database, the difference in the identification accuracy rate between learning data and test data decreased from 6 /\\% for BNNs to 2 /\\% for SWBNNs. From results of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation, circuits of SWBNNs are sufficiently small although they are 10 /\\% bigger than those of BNNs. Therefore, SWBNNs are more accurate than BNNs, and the circuit costs ofintroducing stochastic weights are low.},

abstract={This paper discusses the use of symmetric convolution and the discrete sine and cosine transforms (DSTs and DCTs) for general digital signal processing. The operation of symmetric convolution is a formalized approach to convolving symmetrically extended sequences. The result is the same as that obtained by taking an inverse discrete trigonometric transform (DTT) of the product of the forward DTTs of those two sequences. There are 16 members in the family of DTTs. Each provides a representation for a corresponding distinct type of symmetric-periodic sequence. The author defines symmetric convolution, relates the DSTs and DCTs to symmetric-periodic sequences, and then use these principles to develop simple but powerful convolution-multiplication properties for the entire family of DSTs and DCTs. Symmetric convolution can be used for discrete linear filtering when the filter is symmetric or antisymmetric. The filtering will be efficient because fast algorithms exist for all versions of the DTTs. Conventional linear convolution is possible if one first zero-pad the input data. Symmetric convolution and its fast implementation using DTTs are now an alternative to circular convolution and the DFT.<<ETX>>},

pages={147--166},
abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the idea that the tendency to produce an action should be strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favorable results, and weakened if it produces unfavorable results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that does not need a model of its environment and can be used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL research has been confined to single-agent settings or to multiagent settings where the agents have totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither totally positively nor totally negatively correlated. RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain. This paper investigates the ability of a variety of Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent is the fixed strategy Tit-For-Tat, while in others it is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to play optimally against Tit-For-Tat. Playing against another learner was more difficult because the adaptation of the other learner created a non-stationary environment, and because the other learner was not endowed with any a priori knowledge about the IPD game such as a policy designed to encourage cooperation. The learners that were studied varied along three dimensions: the length of history they received as context, the type of memory they employed (lookup tables based on restricted history windows or recurrent neural networks that can theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in the past), and the exploration schedule they followed. Although all the learners faced difficulties when playing against other learners, agents with longer history windows, lookup table memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best in the IPD games.},

abstract={Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are successfully used in a number of applications. However, their storage and computational requirements have largely prevented their widespread use on mobile devices. Here we present a series of approaches for compressing and speeding up CNNs in the frequency domain, which focuses not only on smaller weights but on all the weights and their underlying connections. By treating convolutional filters as images, we decompose their representations in the frequency domain as common parts (i.e., cluster centers) shared by other similar filters and their individual private parts (i.e., individual residuals). A large number of low-energy frequency coefficients in both parts can be discarded to produce high compression without significantly compromising accuracy. Furthermore, we explore a data-driven method for removing redundancies in both spatial and frequency domains, which allows us to discard more useless weights by keeping similar accuracies. After obtaining the optimal sparse CNN in the frequency domain, we relax the computational burden of convolution operations in CNNs by linearly combining the convolution responses of discrete cosine transform (DCT) bases. The compression and speed-up ratios of the proposed algorithm are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated on benchmark image datasets to demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.},

The network employs the convolution theorem so as to cast convolutions in the spatial domain as products in the frequency domain. Moreover, the non-linearity in deep nets, often achieved by a rectifier unit, is here cast as a convolution in the frequency domain. This not only yields a network which is very computationally efficient at testing but also one whose parameters can all be learnt accordingly. The network can be trained using back propagation and is devoid of complex numbers due to the use of the Hartley transform as an alternative to the Fourier transform. Moreover, the network is potentially applicable to other problems elsewhere in computer vision and image processing which are often cast in the frequency domain. We show results on super-resolution and compare against alternatives elsewhere in the literature.

title={CapsNet comparative performance evaluation for image classification},
eprinttype={arxiv},
abstract={Image classification has become one of the main tasks in the field of computer vision technologies. In this context, a recent algorithm called CapsNet that implements an approach based on activity vectors and dynamic routing between capsules may overcome some of the limitations of the current state of the art artificial neural networks (ANN) classifiers, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the CapsNet algorithm in comparison with three well-known classifiers (Fisher-faces, LeNet, and ResNet). We tested the classification accuracy on four datasets with a different number of instances and classes, including images of faces, traffic signs, and everyday objects. The evaluation results show that even for simple architectures, training the CapsNet algorithm requires significant computational resources and its classification performance falls below the average accuracy values of the other three classifiers. However, we argue that CapsNet seems to be a promising new technique for image classification, and further experiments using more robust computation resources and re-fined CapsNet architectures may produce better outcomes.},

abstract={The standard rules of probability can be interpreted as uniquely valid principles in logic. In this book, E.T. Jaynes dispels the imaginary distinction between'probability theory'and'statistical inference', leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. The material is aimed at readers who are already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher. The book will be of interest to scientists working in any area where inference from incomplete information is necessary. (A cura dell'editore).},

date={2001},
abstract={This paper reviews the main variants of the utility additive (UTA) multicriteria method, and systematically compares their predictive performance on two sets of data. It analyses both those cases where the model provides a ranking with errors and those without errors. First, it shows that the reference projects should be chosen carefully in order to elicit as much information as possible from the decision maker: a set of projects satisfying a fractional factorial plan is recommended. Second, it discusses the use of alternative post-optimality methods for solving the problem of multiple solutions and their dierent predictive performances. Third, it presents the results of simulations based on utility functions involving interdependence between criteria, and shows that UTA handles this problem eectively by an adjustment of its coecients. Finally, the in¯uence of the model's parameters on the predictive performance is also investigated. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

title={UTA Methods},
abstract={Abstract: UTA methods refer to the philosophy of assessing a set of value or utility functions, assuming the axiomatic basis of MAUT and adopting the preference disaggregation principle. UTA methodology uses linear programming techniques in order to optimally infer additive value/utility functions, so that these functions are as consistent as possible with the global decision-maker’s preferences (inference principle). The main objective of this chapter is to analytically present the UTA method and its variants and to summarize the progress made in this field. The historical background and the philosophy of the aggregation-disaggregation approach are firstly given in this chapter. The detailed presentation of the basic UTA algorithm is presented, including the discussion on the stability and sensitivity analyses. Several variants of the UTA method, which incorporate different forms of optimality criteria used in the LP formulation, are also discussed. The implementation of the UTA methods is illustrated by a general overview of UTA-based DSSs, as well as real-world decision-making applications. Finally, several potential future research developments of the UTA methodologies within the context of MCDA are discussed through this chapter.},

title={Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis an Integrated Approach},
groups={tesse:5},
abstract={The field of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), also termed multiple criteria decision aid, or multiple criteria decision making (MCDM), has developed rapidly over the past quarter century and in the process a number of divergent schools of thought have emerged. This can make it difficult for a new entrant into the field to develop a comprehensive appreciation of the range of tools and approaches which are available to assist decision makers in dealing with the ever-present difficulties of seeking compromise or consensus between conflicting inter ests and goals, i.e. the "multiple criteria". The diversity of philosophies and models makes it equally difficult for potential users of MCDA, i.e. management scientists and/or decision makers facing problems involving conflicting goals, to gain a clear understanding of which methodologies are appropriate to their particular context. Our intention in writing this book has been to provide a compre hensive yet widely accessible overview of the main streams of thought within MCDA. We aim to provide readers with sufficient awareness of the underlying philosophies and theories, understanding of the practi cal details of the methods, and insight into practice to enable them to implement any of the approaches in an informed manner. As the title of the book indicates, our emphasis is on developing an integrated view of MCDA, which we perceive to incorporate both integration of differ ent schools of thought within MCDA, and integration of MCDA with broader management theory, science and practice.},

abstract={Neural Networks (NN) are important data mining tool used for classiﬁcation and clustering. It is an attempt to build machine that will mimic brain activities and be able to learn. NN usually learns by examples. If NN is supplied with enough examples, it should be able to perform classiﬁcation and even discover new trends or patterns in data. Basic NN is composed of three layers, input, output and hidden layer. Each layer can have number of nodes and nodes from input layer are connected to the nodes from hidden layer. Nodes from hidden layer are connected to the nodes from output layer. Those connections represent weights between nodes.},

abstract={With traditional linear algebra texts, the course is relatively easy for students during the early stages as material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. However, when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations) are not easily understood and require time to assimilate. These concepts are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, so students' understanding of them is vital to mastering the subject. This text makes these concepts more accessible by introducing them early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, developing them gradually, and returning to them throughout the text so that when they are discussed in the abstract, students are readily able to understand.},

abstract={Software startups are more popular than ever and growing in numbers. They operate under conditions of extreme uncertainty and face many challenges. Often, agile development practices and lean principles are suggested as ways to increase the odds of succeeding as a startup, as they both advocate close customer collaboration and short feedback cycles focusing on delivering direct customer value. However, based on an interview study we see that despite guidance and support in terms of well-known and documented development methods, practitioners find it difficult to implement and apply these in practice. To explore this further, and to propose operational support for software startup companies, this study aims at investigating (1) what are the typical challenges when finding a product idea worth scaling, and (2) what solution would serve to address these challenges. To this end, we propose the ‘Early Stage Software Startup Development Model’ (ESSSDM). The model extends already existing lean principles, but offers novel support for practitioners for investigating multiple product ideas in parallel, for determining when to move forward with a product idea, and for deciding when to abandon a product idea. The model was evaluated in a software startup project, as well as with industry professionals within the software startup domain.},

abstract={Tubular bells are geometrically simple representatives of three-dimensional vibrating structures. Under certain assumptions, a tubular bell can be modeled as a rectangular plate with different types of homogeneous boundary conditions. Suitable functional transformations with respect to time and space turn the corresponding initial-boundary value problem into a two-dimensional transfer function. An algorithmic model follows according to the functional transformation method in digital sound synthesis. As with simpler vibrating structures (strings, membranes) the synthesis algorithms consist of a parallel arrangement of second-order sections. Their coefﬁcients are obtained by simple analytic expressions directly from the physical parameters of the tubular bell.},

abstract={Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-speciﬁc abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efﬁciency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simpliﬁes debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

abstract={The development of digital fabrication has reintroduced material processes with digital processes. There has been much discussion about the tool and the objects of the tool, but little discussion of the implication of the material process on the digital process. A brief historical review on the development of computer numerical control and the origins of the Bézier curve reveals an instrumental fact: computer numerical controlled tools necessitated advancements in computational surfaces which eventually led to NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces. In other words, the origins of NURBS surfaces resides in its relation to material processes, rather than many current approaches that develop free form surfaces and then force the tool onto the material without regard to the material properties.},

abstract={One hundred years after the introduction of the Bernstein polynomial basis, we survey the historical development and current state of theory, algorithms, and applications associated with this remarkable method of representing polynomials over ﬁnite domains. Originally introduced by Sergei Natanovich Bernstein to facilitate a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, the leisurely convergence rate of Bernstein polynomial approximations to continuous functions caused them to languish in obscurity, pending the advent of digital computers. With the desire to exploit the power of computers for geometric design applications, however, the Bernstein form began to enjoy widespread use as a versatile means of intuitively constructing and manipulating geometric shapes, spurring further development of basic theory, simple and eﬃcient recursive algorithms, recognition of its excellent numerical stability properties, and an increasing diversiﬁcation of its repertoire of applications. This survey provides a brief historical perspective on the evolution of the Bernstein polynomial basis, and a synopsis of the current state of associated algorithms and applications.},

abstract={As scientific and engineering projects grow larger and more complex, it is increasingly likely that those projects will be written in C++. With embedded hardware growing more powerful, much of its software is moving to C++, too. Mastering C++ gives you strong skills for programming at nearly every level, from “close to the hardware” to the highest-level abstractions. In short, C++ is a language that scientific and technical practitioners need to know. Peter Gottschling’s Discovering Modern C++ is an intensive introduction that guides you smoothly to sophisticated approaches based on advanced features. Gottschling introduces key concepts using examples from many technical problem domains, drawing on his extensive experience training professionals and teaching C++ to students of physics, math, and engineering. This book is designed to help you get started rapidly and then master increasingly robust features, from lambdas to expression templates. You’ll also learn how to take advantage of the powerful libraries available to C++ programmers: both the Standard Template Library (STL) and scientific libraries for arithmetic, linear algebra, differential equations, and graphs. Throughout, Gottschling demonstrates how to write clear and expressive software using object orientation, generics, metaprogramming, and procedural techniques. By the time you’re finished, you’ll have mastered all the abstractions you need to write C++ programs with exceptional quality and performance.},

abstract={Calculus, Better Explained is the calculus primer you wish you had in school. Learn the essential concepts using concrete analogies and vivid diagrams, not mechanical definitions. Calculus isn't a set of rules, it's a specific, practical viewpoint we can apply to everyday thinking.Frustrated With Abstract, Mechanical Lessons? I was too. Despite years of classes, I didn't have a strong understanding of calculus concepts. Sure, I could follow mechanical steps, but I had no lasting intuition.The classes I've seen are too long, taught in the wrong order, and without solid visualizations. Here's how this course is different:1) It gets to the point. A typical class plods along, saving concepts like Integrals until Week 8. I want to see what calculus can offer by Minute 8. Each compact, tightly-written lesson can be read in 15 minutes.2) Concepts are taught in their natural order. Most classes begin with the theory of limits, a technical concept discovered 150 years after calculus was invented. That's like putting a new driver into a Formula-1 racecar on day 1. We can begin with the easy-to-grasp concepts discovered 2000 years ago.3) It has vivid analogies and visualizations. Calculus is usually defined as the "study of change"... which sounds like history or geology. Instead of an abstract definition, we'll see calculus a step-by-step viewpoint to explore patterns.4) It's written by a human, for humans. I'm not a haughty professor or strict schoolmarm. I'm a friend who saw a fun way to internalize some difficult ideas. This course is a chat over coffee, not a keep-your-butt-in-your-seat lecture.The goal is to help you grasp the Aha! moments behind calculus in hours, not a painful semester (or a decade, in my case).Join Thousands Of Happy ReadersHere's a few samples of anonymous feedback as people went through the course. The material covers a variety of levels, whether you're looking for intuitive appreciation or the specifics of the rules."I've done all of this stuff before, and I do understand calculus intuitively, but this was the most fun I've had going through this kind of thing. The informal writing and multitude of great analogies really helps this become an enjoyable read and the rest is simple after that - you make this seem easy, but at the same time, you aren't doing it for us…This is what math education is supposed to be like :)""I have psychology and medicine background so I relate your ideas to my world. To me the most useful idea was what each circle production feels like. Rings are natural growth…Slices are automatable chunks and automation cheapens production… Boards in the shape on an Arch are psychologically most palatable for work (wind up, hard part, home stretch). Brilliant and kudos, from one INTP to another.""I like how you're introducing both derivatives and integrals at the same time - it's really helps with understanding the relationship between them. Also, I appreciate how you're coming from such a different angle than is traditionally taken - it's always interesting to see where you decide to go next.""That was breathtaking. Seriously, mail my air back please, I've grown used to it. Beautiful work, thank you. Lesson 15 was masterful. I am starting to feel calculus. "d/dx is good" (sorry, couldn't resist!)."},

On top of that, they dish out pages of code and leave it up to you to “learn by osmosis.”If you've tried to learn React on your own, you've probably had the same experience I did: after sifting through countless tutorials and video, you still can’t cobble together your own app. One second you’re nodding along, sure that you understand. The next, you’re staring at a blinking cursor wondering what to type.Thousands of people are already using React in their jobs or startups, and you can too -- once you figure it out.But what if you could skip straight to being as productive with React as you are with your current framework of choice?What if you were able to code as fast as you can think, using the JavaScript you know and love?Writing apps could be fun again! And fast.Teaching yourself React can be overwhelming… but it doesn’t have to be. You can master the fundamentals in a matter of days.Here's the thing: you need real practice. Not just nodding along to tutorials, but actually building examples and exercises. That's how you gain mastery, and this book will show you how.You’ll get hands-on practice building a series of small components and micro apps – no big monolithic app here. The bite-size apps will have you reviewing concepts until they’re second nature.With the included exercises you will be writing your own code right from the start – this isn’t a “copy, paste, watch it run” tutorial.Don't worry, we won't build any "ToDo" apps. The world already has enough of those.Learn to turn mockups directly into code, how to “think in components,” and how to handle changing state in React's world of one-way data flow.Here's what the book covers:- Easy project setup with Create React App (you’ll be running code within minutes)- Debugging strategies for when things go wrong- Mastering JSX syntax, including “if”s, loops, and dynamic child components- Using props to communicate between components, and make them as reusable as possible- How PropTypes can save you time debugging and help “future you” remember how to use the components you wrote- Using the “children” prop to render dynamic content- How to write React in the modern ES6 style, with a gentle introduction to ES6 syntax (you don't need to know ES6!)- How input controls work in React (controlled and uncontrolled)- Where and how to properly use component state in a React application- Stateful vs Stateless components- The lifecycle of a component, and how to use it to your advantageThe book includes examples large and small, and 25 exercises to hone your knowledge.Buy Pure React and start learning React today!},

abstract={LSTM, GRU, and more advanced recurrent neural networksLike Markov models, Recurrent Neural Networks are all about learning sequences - but whereas Markov Models are limited by the Markov assumption, Recurrent Neural Networks are not - and as a result, they are more expressive, and more powerful than anything we’ve seen on tasks that we haven’t made progress on in decades.In the first section of the course we are going to add the concept of time to our neural networks.I’ll introduce you to the Simple Recurrent Unit, also known as the Elman unit.We are going to revisit the XOR problem, but we’re going to extend it so that it becomes the parity problem - you’ll see that regular feedforward neural networks will have trouble solving this problem but recurrent networks will work because the key is to treat the input as a sequence.In the next section of the book, we are going to revisit one of the most popular applications of recurrent neural networks - language modeling.One popular application of neural networks for language is word vectors or word embeddings. The most common technique for this is called Word2Vec, but I’ll show you how recurrent neural networks can also be used for creating word vectors.In the section after, we’ll look at the very popular LSTM, or long short-term memory unit, and the more modern and efficient GRU, or gated recurrent unit, which has been proven to yield comparable performance.We’ll apply these to some more practical problems, such as learning a language model from Wikipedia data and visualizing the word embeddings we get as a result.All of the materials required for this course can be downloaded and installed for FREE. We will do most of our work in Numpy, Matplotlib, and Theano. I am always available to answer your questions and help you along your data science journey.See you in class!“Hold up... what’s deep learning and all this other crazy stuff you’re talking about?”If you are completely new to deep learning, you might want to check out my earlier books and courses on the subject:Deep Learning in Python https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CVJ19E8Deep Learning in Python Prerequisities https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D7GDRQ2Much like how IBM’s Deep Blue beat world champion chess player Garry Kasparov in 1996, Google’s AlphaGo recently made headlines when it beat world champion Lee Sedol in March 2016.What was amazing about this win was that experts in the field didn’t think it would happen for another 10 years. The search space of Go is much larger than that of chess, meaning that existing techniques for playing games with artificial intelligence were infeasible. Deep learning was the technique that enabled AlphaGo to correctly predict the outcome of its moves and defeat the world champion.Deep learning progress has accelerated in recent years due to more processing power (see: Tensor Processing Unit or TPU), larger datasets, and new algorithms like the ones discussed in this book.},

@book{2015KelleherFundamentals,
abstract={A comprehensive introduction to the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications.Machine learning is often used to build predictive models by extracting patterns from large datasets. These models are used in predictive data analytics applications including price prediction, risk assessment, predicting customer behavior, and document classification. This introductory textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Technical and mathematical material is augmented with explanatory worked examples, and case studies illustrate the application of these models in the broader business context.After discussing the trajectory from data to insight to decision, the book describes four approaches to machine learning: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, and error-based learning. Each of these approaches is introduced by a nontechnical explanation of the underlying concept, followed by mathematical models and algorithms illustrated by detailed worked examples. Finally, the book considers techniques for evaluating prediction models and offers two case studies that describe specific data analytics projects through each phase of development, from formulating the business problem to implementation of the analytics solution. The book, informed by the authors' many years of teaching machine learning, and working on predictive data analytics projects, is suitable for use by undergraduates in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics; by graduate students in disciplines with applications for predictive data analytics; and as a reference for professionals.},

abstract={Games are everywhere: Drivers manoeuvring in heavy traffic are playing a driving game. Bargain hunters bidding on eBay are playing an auctioning game. A firm negotiating next year's wage is playing a bargaining game. The opposing candidates in an election are playing a political game. The supermarket's price for corn flakes is decided by playing an economic game.Game theory is about how to play such games in a rational way. Even when the players have not thought everything out in advance, game theory often works for the same reason that mindless animals sometimes end up behaving very cleverly: evolutionary forces eliminate irrational play because it is unfit.Game theory has seen spectacular successes in evolutionary biology and economics, and is beginning to revolutionize other disciplines from psychology to political science. This Very Short Introduction introduces the fascinating world of game theory, showing how it can be understood without mathematical equations, and revealing that everything from how to play poker optimally to the sex ratio among bees can be understood by anyone willing to think seriously about the problem.ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

edition={Translation edition},
title={How to Write a Thesis},
abstract={Umberto Eco's wise and witty guide to researching and writing a thesis, published in English for the first time. By the time Umberto Eco published his best-selling novel The Name of the Rose, he was one of Italy's most celebrated intellectuals, a distinguished academic and the author of influential works on semiotics. Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, How to Write a Thesis, in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis―from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, How to Write a Thesis has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English. Eco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. How to Write a Thesis is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid “thesis neurosis” and he answers the important question “Must You Read Books?” He reminds students “You are not Proust” and “Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft.” Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data.How to Write a Thesis belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere. Already a classic, it would fit nicely between two other classics: Strunk and White and The Name of the Rose.ContentsThe Definition and Purpose of a Thesis • Choosing the Topic • Conducting Research • The Work Plan and the Index Cards • Writing the Thesis • The Final Draft},

abstract={(Technical Reference). In his first book, The Daily Adventures of Mixerman , the author detailed the frustrating and often hilarious goings on during the process of recording a major-label band. Musicians, engineers, and producers laughed and cried at the crazy goings-on they'd never imagined or recognized all too well. Now Mixerman turns his razor-sharp gaze to the art of mixing and gives followers and the uninitiated reason to hope if not for logic and civility in the recording studio then at least for a good sounding record. With a firm commitment to art over technology and to maintaining a grasp of each, Mixerman outlines his own approach to recording success, based on his years mixing records in all genres of music for all kinds of artists, often under trying circumstances. As he states in his introduction to the new volume, "Even if you're not a professional mixer, even if you're a musician trying to mix your own work or a studio owner in a smaller market, you have your own set of pressures to deal with while you're mixing. Regardless of what those pressures are, it's important to identify and recognize them, if for no other reason than so you can learn to completely ignore them." But how?

title={Neuroplasticity},
author={Costandi, Moheb},
abstract={The real story of how our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes―with or without “brain training.”Fifty years ago, neuroscientists thought that a mature brain was fixed like a fly in amber, unable to change. Today, we know that our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes. This concept of neuroplasticity has captured the imagination of a public eager for self-improvement―and has inspired countless Internet entrepreneurs who peddle dubious “brain training” games and apps. In this book, Moheb Costandi offers a concise and engaging overview of neuroplasticity for the general reader, describing how our brains change continuously in response to our actions and experiences.Costandi discusses key experimental findings, and describes how our thinking about the brain has evolved over time. He explains how the brain changes during development, and the “synaptic pruning” that takes place before brain maturity. He shows that adult brains can grow new cells (citing, among many other studies, research showing that sexually mature male canaries learn a new song every year). He describes the kind of brain training that can bring about improvement in brain function. It's not gadgets and games that promise to “rewire your brain” but such sustained cognitive tasks as learning a musical instrument or a new language. (Costandi also notes that London cabbies increase their gray matter after rigorous training in their city's complicated streets.) He tells how brains compensate after stroke or injury; describes addiction and pain as maladaptive forms of neuroplasticity; and considers brain changes that accompany childhood, adolescence, parenthood, and aging. Each of our brains is custom-built. Neuroplasticity is at the heart of what makes us human.},

Neural networks are a key element of deep learning and artificial intelligence, which today is capable of some truly impressive feats. Yet too few really understand how neural networks actually work. This guide will take you on a fun and unhurried journey, starting from very simple ideas, and gradually building up an understanding of how neural networks work. You won't need any mathematics beyond secondary school, and an accessible introduction to calculus is also included. The ambition of this guide is to make neural networks as accessible as possible to as many readers as possible - there are enough texts for advanced readers already!You'll learn to code in Python and make your own neural network, teaching it to recognise human handwritten numbers, and performing as well as professionally developed networks. Part 1 is about ideas. We introduce the mathematical ideas underlying the neural networks, gently with lots of illustrations and examples. Part 2 is practical. We introduce the popular and easy to learn Python programming language, and gradually builds up a neural network which can learn to recognise human handwritten numbers, easily getting it to perform as well as networks made by professionals. Part 3 extends these ideas further. We push the performance of our neural network to an industry leading 98 /\\% using only simple ideas and code, test the network on your own handwriting, take a privileged peek inside the mysterious mind of a neural network, and even get it all working on a Raspberry Pi.

abstract={This book is a selection of the best articles from Game Theory Tuesdays, a column from the blog Mind Your Decisions. Articles from Game Theory Tuesdays have been referenced in The Freakonomics Blog, Yahoo Finance, and CNN.com. Game theory is the study of interactive decision making--that is, in situations where each person's action affects the outcome for the whole group. Game theory is a beautiful subject and this book will teach you how to understand the theory and practically implement solutions through a series of stories and the aid of over 30 illustrations. This book has two primary objectives. (1) To help you recognize strategic games, like the Prisoner's Dilemma, Bertrand Duopoly, Hotelling's Game, the Game of Chicken, and Mutually Assured Destruction. (2) To show you how to make better decisions and change the game, a powerful concept that can transform no-win situations into mutually beneficial outcomes. You'll learn how to negotiate better by making your threats credible, sometimes limiting options or burning bridges, and thinking about new ways to create better outcomes. As these goals indicate, game theory is about more than board games and gambling. It all seems so simple, and yet that definition belies the complexity of game theory. While it may only take seconds to get a sense of game theory, it takes a lifetime to appreciate and master it. This book will get you started.},

Hudspeth, PhDA Doody's Core Title for 2017!900 full-color illustrationsDeciphering the link between the human brain and behavior has always been one of the most intriguing―and often challenging―aspects of scientific endeavor. The sequencing of the human genome, and advances in molecular biology, have illuminated the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases and have propelled our knowledge of how the brain controls behavior.To grasp the wider implications of these developments and gain a fundamental understanding of this dynamic, fast-moving field, Principles of Neuroscience stands alone as the most authoritative and indispensible resource of its kind.In this classic text, prominent researchers in the field expertly survey the entire spectrum of neural science, giving an up-to-date, unparalleled view of the discipline for anyone who studies brain and mind. Here, in one remarkable volume, is the current state of neural science knowledge―ranging from molecules and cells, to anatomic structures and systems, to the senses and cognitive functions―all supported by more than 900 precise, full-color illustrations. In addition to clarifying complex topics, the book also benefits from a cohesive organization, beginning with an insightful overview of the interrelationships between the brain, nervous system, genes, and behavior. Principles of Neural Science then proceeds with an in-depth examination of the molecular and cellular biology of nerve cells, synaptic transmission, and the neural basis of cognition. The remaining sections illuminate how cells, molecules, and systems give us sight, hearing, touch, movement, thought, learning, memories, and emotions.The new fifth edition of Principles of Neural Science is thoroughly updated to reflect the tremendous amount of research, and the very latest clinical perspectives, that have significantly transformed the field within the last decade.Ultimately, Principles of Neural Science affirms that all behavior is an expression of neural activity, and that the future of clinical neurology and psychiatry hinges on the progress of neural science. Far exceeding the scope and scholarship of similar texts, this unmatched guide offers a commanding, scientifically rigorous perspective on the molecular mechanisms of neural function and disease―one that you’ll continually rely on to advance your comprehension of brain, mind, and behavior.FEATURESThe cornerstone reference in the field of neuroscience that explains how the nerves, brain, and mind functionClear emphasis on how behavior can be examined through the electrical activity of both individual neurons and systems of nerve cellsCurrent focus on molecular biology as a tool for probing the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases, including muscular dystrophy, Huntington disease, and certain forms of Alzheimer’s diseaseMore than 900 engaging full-color illustrations―including line drawings, radiographs, micrographs, and medical photographs clarify often-complex neuroscience conceptsOutstanding section on the development and emergence of behavior, including important coverage of},

Unlike other popularizations that shy away from quantum mechanics' weirdness, Quantum Mechanics embraces the utter strangeness of quantum logic. The authors offer crystal-clear explanations of the principles of quantum states, uncertainty and time dependence, entanglement, and particle and wave states, among other topics, and each chapter includes exercises to ensure mastery of each area.

You will learn synthesizer operation, starting with the underlying theory of each synthesizer component, and moving on to the theory of how these components combine to form fully working musical instruments that function on a variety of target digital audio workstations (DAWs). Containing some of the latest advances in theory and algorithm development, this book contains information that has never been published in textbook form, including several unique algorithms of the author’s own design. The book is broken into three parts: plug-in programming, theory and design of the central synthesizer components of oscillators, envelope generators, and filters, and the design and implementation of six complete polyphonic software synthesizer musical instruments, which can be played in real time. The instruments implement advanced concepts including a user-programmable modulation matrix. The final chapter shows you the theory and code for a suite of delay effects to augment your synthesizers, introducing you to audio effect processing. The companion website, www.focalpress.com/cw/pirkle, gives you access to free software to guide you through the application of concepts discussed in the book, and code for both Windows and Mac platforms.

In this study, I shed light on this issue by conducting an empirical analysis of the patenting strategies of technology startups, examining the relationship between a company’s patent applications and different events over the company’s life: rounds of investment received, company acquisition and closure. I provide the first comprehensive cross-industry analysis of this question, by analyzing the patent portfolios of United States startups listed in CrunchBase, a crowd-sourced registry of tech companies used by the startup industry. By looking into these companies’ public patent applications from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database between 2008 and 2012, I examine the patenting patterns of startups as they progress through funding rounds.},

edition={Edição: 1.1},
publisher={Magic Light Press},
abstract={This is the fabulous FIRST EDITION of Astral DynamicsThe first edition of Astral Dynamics (the book you are now reading about) contains a great deal of content that was dropped from the 2009 second edition to save space. These are essentially two quite different books. Most people want both these amazing books, so we convinced Robert Bruce to produce an eBook version of the original First Edition of Astral Dynamics, with full color illustrations and other improvements. This First Edition went out of print in 2009. THE FIRST EDITION OF ASTRAL DYNAMICS - In one fascinating volume, Robert Bruce gathered together a personal narrative, a "how-to", a troubleshooting guide, and a theoretical perspective on the nonphysical structure underlying the strange and multidimensional life we all lead. Whether you are a skeptic, a veteran astral projector, a newbie, or an armchair traveler, there's treasure here. It's in a class by itself. What he says here rings true. In fact, it does a lot more than ring true. It opens doors. Astral Dynamics provides the intelligent and motivated reader with everything needed to put theory into practice. The book's six parts may be read each on their own, but they have been placed to build nicely one upon the other. Part One, "Elements of Projection", presents Robert's theory of what actually goes on when the projectable astral double leaves the physical body. This in itself, right out of the gate, is fascinating terrain. His theory of the consequences of the mind-split that results from projection is itself worth the price of the book. Part Two, "NEW Energy Ways", presents his stunningly practical method of raising energy and awareness by using touch, which he calls Tactile Imaging. I have tried this method on half a dozen people, selected more or less at random, each of whom obtained the desired awareness within seconds! And then, as if the new method of visualization weren't enough, Robert proceeds to describe the nature and anatomy of our energy bodies, a description firmly rooted in his own personal explorations. Part Three, "Core Skills", builds on this foundation, demonstrating how to succeed at the three tasks that are essential to success in astral projection: deep physical relaxation, taming the mind, and attaining the trance state. Part Four, "Projection Exit and Technique", tells you what you need to know to stop reading about astral projection and actually do it. Part Five, "The Akashic Connection", proceeds into the realm of the theoretical, not for the sake of getting lost in theory, but in order to make sense of things seen and heard. Particularly interesting is Robert's description of the nature and meaning of what he calls the Akashic Pulse. As to his description and analysis of the astral planes, the silver cord, the etheric body, and the Akashic record — I doubt that these have been equaled anywhere in the subject's extensive modern literature. I am confident that they have not been excelled. Part Six, "Strange Astral Phenomena", takes on a few conundrums that are worth exploring. Projection into higher realms; reality fluctuations; astral noise; what Robert calls astral wildlife, and astral combat... he covers the turf as it hasn't been covered to date. And he does it so casually, in so unpretentious a manner, his mood ranging from deepest awe to casually joking, with all the range between. If you have any interest at all in the subject of astral projection, lucid dreaming — higher consciousness in general — you're going to love this book. I predict that it will become a classic, read and valued for many years to come.

The aim of this research study is the implementation of soft computing methods to musical signal analysis and to the recognition of musical sounds and phrases. Accordingly, some methods based on such learning algorithms as neural networks, rough sets and fuzzy-logic were conceived, implemented and tested. Additionally, the above-mentioned methods were applied to the analysis and verification of subjective testing results. The last problem discussed within the framework of this book was the problem of fuzzy control of the classical pipe organ instrument. The obtained results show that computational intelligence and soft computing may be used for solving some vital problems in both musical and architectural acoustics.},

It is designed for musicians who find their art increasingly mediated by technology, and for anyone who is interested in the intersection of art and science.In Volume 1, Loy presents the materials of music (notes, intervals, and scales); the physical properties of music (frequency, amplitude, duration, and timbre); the perception of music and sound (how we hear); and music composition. Calling himself “a composer seduced into mathematics,” Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio.Additional material can be found at http://www.musimathics.com.},

title={Fuzzy Logic with Engineering Applications},
date={2008-03-11},
abstract={Fuzzy logic refers to a large subject dealing with a set of methods to characterize and quantify uncertainty in engineering systems that arise from ambiguity, imprecision, fuzziness, and lack of knowledge. Fuzzy logic is a reasoning system based on a foundation of fuzzy set theory, itself an extension of classical set theory, where set membership can be partial as opposed to all or none, as in the binary features of classical logic. Fuzzy logic is a relatively new discipline in which major advances have been made over the last decade or so with regard to theory and applications. Following on from the successful first edition, this fully updated new edition is therefore very timely and much anticipated. Concentration on the topics of fuzzy logic combined with an abundance of worked examples, chapter problems and commercial case studies is designed to help motivate a mainstream engineering audience, and the book is further strengthened by the inclusion of an online solutions manual as well as dedicated software codes. Senior undergraduate and postgraduate students in most engineering disciplines, academics and practicing engineers, plus some working in economics, control theory, operational research etc, will all find this a valuable addition to their bookshelves.},

abstract={"The theory of linear damped oscillations was originally developed more than hundred years ago and is still of vital research interest to engineers, mathematicians and physicists alike. This theory plays a central role in explaining the stability of mechanical structures in civil engineering, but it also has applications in other fields such as electrical network systems and quantum mechanics. This volume gives an introduction to linear finite dimensional damped systems as they are viewed by an applied mathematician. After a short overview of the physical principles leading to the linear systems model, a largely self-contained mathematical theory for this model is presented. this includes the geometry of the underlying indefinite eigenvalue problem. Particular attention is paid to the sensitivity issues which influence numerical computations. finally, several recent research developments are included, e.g. Lyapunov stability and the perturbation of the time evolution."--P.

Here, in informal text and about a score of plates, is a story that takes the teenage layman on this interesting trip. The younger reader, like a good musicologist, follows the steps in the evolution of the most important instruments that make up today's symphony orchestra, and the development of music itself (scales, modes, keys, and temperaments). Physics and music is also a source, although, of necessity a modest one, of information about the music research that has been underway in the Soviet Union, especially in the scientific manufacture of the violin, and in electrophonic and synthetic music. This why the foreign reader might think of a degree of "bias" on the part of the author. Yet, it gives him an insight into what is going on in a country that has given the world quite a number of great composers.},

For dry, clear specimens of picba commun (Norway spruce, picea excelsa) and sapin pictin (silver fir, abies amabilis) we present a comparison of results from tests by a resonance flexure method with results obtained from four-point static flexure tests. For a wide range of specimen size the resonance flexure method provides a simpler, more rapidly performed alternative to the classical static flexure method, giving Young's modulus values which are for the spruce and fir specimens of this study, nearly identical to those calculated from the static flexure tests. Results are also presented which show that a resonance longitudinal method yields higher values of Young's modulus and an ultrasonic method yields still higher values. We provide also a comparison of the four test methods applied to isotropic materials.},

Diffkulties met by novice musicians, neuro-muscular fatigue caused by guitar playing and occupational diseases occurring to professional guitarists, justify this study. Characteristics of existing electric guitar models which add to musician’s fatigue or difficulty, were identified. A number of ergonomic requirements were then derived. The redesign process tried to satisfy these requirements, considering at the same time musical requirements and technical constraints. A comparative evaluation of the designed ergonomic guitar with three existing electric guitar models, showed1 that although the designed electric guitar preserves the main features of the instrument, it achieves better user fit.

abstract={Industrial design attempts to enhance quality of life by designing products that meet consumer requirements. Combining concepts from various ﬁelds, including design, computer technology, aesthetics, and economics, industrial designers seek to improve quality of life by designing products that meet consumer needs. Industrial designers focus on customers' perceptions of products and their preferences for certain shapes, textures, colors, styles, linguistic variables, prices, and functions. Because new products are continuously being released, manufacturers must continually design products to satisfy customer needs to avoid displacement by market competitors. When planning strategies for marketing products to various users and consumers, managers must often consider multiple combinations of product shapes and must design products that cater to consumer tastes to minimize the risk of their products being rejected by the market. Companies with highly-skilled designers have more ideas, better and more competitive products, and shorter production times than companies with weak designers. This study analyzed product styles by applying genetic algorithms and Kansei Engineering Type II (AHP and Quantiﬁcation Theory Type I). This research transforms the psychological conceptions of consumers into linguistic variables. A MATLAB program was constructed to enable designers to simulate consumer logic. The cognitive dissonance between virtual and real models was minimized by using a 3D CAD model, and the virtual model of optimum solutions in this study employed a rapid prototyping machine to generate real models efﬁciently. Future genetic algorithm models applying different decision theories may achieve even faster and more accurate results.},

The experimental results are analyzed by applied back-propagation neural network, which establish the relationships between product–form parameters and adjective image words. A database for the connections among the design elements, product images and shape generation rules was constructed. A computer-aided system for product–form design was then developed based on this database. With the aid of this design system, a designer can generate 3D models of any product with different images by providing basic design elements and shape generation rules. Simultaneously, a rendered 3D model of the designed product and its images are also presented by this system. Therefore, changing the conﬁguration parameter(s) until the product shape is acceptable can modify the image of a product. In this manner, the designed product can ﬁt more closely to the consumers’ desire.

abstract={A platform for manipulation and examination the acoustic guitar is presented, based on a novel guitar design – the Chameleon Guitar – featuring a replaceable acoustic resonator functioning as the soundboard of the instrument. The goal of the design process is to create a tone as sonically close to that of a traditional guitar as possible, while maintaining an easily replaceable soundboard. An iterative, data driven approach was used, each design step coming under examination from one or more measurement tools: ﬁnite-element method, acoustic impulse testing, and laser vibrometry. Ideal resonator geometry, bridge location, and piezoelectric sensor positions were determined. The ﬁnished instrument was then examined with laser vibrometry to conﬁrm earlier results, evaluate the behavior and chosen sensor positions for various tonewoods, and examine the acoustic effects of adding sensors and wax ﬁnish. The conclusions drawn are diverse and point to the signiﬁcance of attention to detail in each step of instrument construction. For example, when changing instrument material from one softwood to another, ideal locations for piezoelectric sensors are subject to change. We conclude that detailed acoustic analysis can signiﬁcantly aid in the construction of new instruments by quantifying the impact of instrument geometry and material properties.},

abstract={When generating new design concepts, most industrial designers tend to draw upon stereotypical images and their own personal design experiences. The evaluation of each individual design candidate in terms of its ability to meet the demands of the marketplace is a crucial step within the conceptual design stage. Consequently, this paper proposes a method which enables an automatic product form search or product image evaluation by means of fuzzy neural network and genetic algorithm. Initially, a feature-based hierarchical computer-aided design (CAD) model is constructed, in which the related form parameters are thoroughly deﬁned in applicable domains to facilitate the automatic generation of new product forms. A fuzzy neural network algorithm is then applied to establish the relationships between the input form parameters and a series of adjectival image words. In a reverse process, genetic algorithm is employed to search for a near-optimal design which satisﬁes the designer’s required product image by using the trained neural network as a ﬁtness function. The proposed method provides an automatic design system, which gives designers the ability to rapidly obtain a product form and its corresponding image, or to search for the ideal form which ﬁts a required image in a shorter lead-time. An electronic door lock design is chosen as the subject of the current investigation. However, the proposed method is equally applicable to the design of other products.},

In this paper, the relationships among the product image, color area, and aesthetic measurement of the product are studied. The pixels of an area of color are used to obtain the proportionate relationship between different colored areas in a given solid visual angle. Based on the relationship among the Hue, Value, Chroma and colored area proposed by Munsell, the other factors are integrated to set up one formula for evaluating the aesthetic degree of color matching. The aesthetics measurement is considered to be inﬂuenced by the color environments, color areas, component colors and display angles of the product. The color planning for developing a cell phone was performed based on this model. The experimental results veriﬁed this model can be used for color planning in product design.},

abstract={The authors performed a behavioral study of the complexity of left-hand finger movements in classical guitar playing. Six professional guitarists played movement sequences in a fixed tempo. Left-hand finger movements were recorded in 3 dimensions, and the guitar sound was recorded synchronously. Assuming that performers prefer to avoid extreme joint angles when moving, the authors hypothesized 3 complexity factors. The results showed differential effects of the complexity factors on the performance measures and on participants’ judgments of complexity. The results demonstrated that keeping the joints in the middle of their range is an important principle in guitar playing, and players exploit the available tolerance in timing and placement of the left-hand fingers to control the acoustic output variability.},

abstract={The economics of French instrumentmaking is mostly made up of very small handicraft enterprises. But craftsmen do not always have the means to embark, by themselves, on an innovation strategy. The idea is to try to respond to current challenges in instrument making; for example, the reduction in costs of design times or the adaptation to customer needs. All of this necessitates the development of low cost tools for characterising and prototyping of instruments dedicated to their use in workshops. Examples of collaborative approach between instrument makers and research laboratories are presented. Mainly, the PAFI project, for “Instrument-making Aid Platform” aims to develop characterisation tools for all the instrument families. The initiative’s originality lies in the fact that “pilot craftsmen” are associated with every stage of development. The process involves a research program and the support of craftsmen for developing the hardware and software. Bearing in mind the international economic context, these experiences may act as a basis for broadening and pursuing this initiative on an international scale. The open and progressive nature of the work means that we can consider such a prospect with a view to maintaining the smallscale production of high-quality instruments.},

This optimized mapping extends the use of the NeuCube, which was initially designed for spatiotemporal brain data, to work on arbitrary stream data and to achieve a better accuracy of temporal pattern recognition, a better and earlier event prediction and a better understanding of complex temporal stream data through visualization of the NeuCube connectivity. The effect of the new mapping is demonstrated on three bench mark problems. The ﬁrst one is early prediction of patient sleep stage event from temporal physiological data. The second one is pattern recognition of dynamic temporal patterns of trafﬁc in the Bay Area of California and the last one is the Challenge 2012 contest data set. In all cases the use of the proposed mapping leads to an improved accuracy of pattern recognition and event prediction and a better understanding of the data when compared to traditional machine learning techniques or spiking neural network reservoirs with arbitrary mapping of the variables.},

abstract={We develop a technique using deep neural network for human facial expression recognition. Images of human faces are preprocessed with photometric normalization and histogram manipulation to remove illumination variance. Facial features are then extracted by convolving each preprocessed image with 40 Gabor filters. Kernel PCA is applied to features before feeding them into the deep neural network that consists of 1 input layer, 2 hidden layers and a softmax classifier. The deep network is trained using greedy layer-wise strategy. We use the Extended CohnKanade Dataset for training and testing. Recognition tests are performed on six basic expressions (i.e. surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, sadness). To test the robustness of the classification system further, and for benchmark comparison, we add a seventh emotion, namely “contempt”, for additional recognition tests. We construct confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the deep network. It is demonstrated that the network generalizes to new images fairly successfully with an average recognition rate of 96.8 /\\% for six emotions and 91.7 /\\% for seven emotions. In comparison with shallower neural networks and SVM methods, the proposed deep network method can provide better recognition performance.},

abstract={We introduce a parametric nonlinear transformation that is well-suited for Gaussianizing data from natural images. The data are linearly transformed, and each component is then normalized by a pooled activity measure, computed by exponentiating a weighted sum of rectiﬁed and exponentiated components and a constant. We optimize the parameters of the full transformation (linear transform, exponents, weights, constant) over a database of natural images, directly minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The optimized transformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a signiﬁcantly smaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative methods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is differentiable and can be efﬁciently inverted, and thus induces a density model on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to samples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as a prior probability density that can be used to remove additive noise. Finally, we show that the transformation can be cascaded, with each layer optimized using the same Gaussianization objective, thus offering an unsupervised method of optimizing a deep network architecture.},

abstract={A sparse representation classiﬁer (SRC) and a kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) are two successful methods for face recognition. An SRC is good at dealing with occlusion, while a KDA does well in suppressing intraclass variations. In this paper, we propose kernel extended dictionary (KED) for face recognition, which provides an efﬁcient way for combining KDA and SRC. We ﬁrst learn several kernel principal components of occlusion variations as an occlusion model, which can represent the possible occlusion variations efﬁciently. Then, the occlusion model is projected by KDA to get the KED, which can be computed via the same kernel trick as new testing samples. Finally, we use structured SRC for classiﬁcation, which is fast as only a small number of atoms are appended to the basic dictionary, and the feature dimension is low. We also extend KED to multikernel space to fuse different types of features at kernel level. Experiments are done on several large-scale data sets, demonstrating that not only does KED get impressive results for nonoccluded samples, but it also handles the occlusion well without overﬁtting, even with a single gallery sample per subject.},

Each of the architectures we describe can provide variable compression rates during deployment without requiring retraining of the network: each network need only be trained once. All of our architectures consist of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoder and decoder, a binarizer, and a neural network for entropy coding. We compare RNN types (LSTM, associative LSTM) and introduce a new hybrid of GRU and ResNet. We also study “one-shot” versus additive reconstruction architectures and introduce a new scaled-additive framework. We compare to previous work, showing improvements of 4.3 /\\%–8.8 /\\% AUC (area under the rate-distortion curve), depending on the perceptual metric used. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst neural network architecture that is able to outperform JPEG at image compression across most bitrates on the rate-distortion curve on the Kodak dataset images, with and without the aid of entropy coding.},

abstract={A large fraction of Internet trafﬁc is now driven by requests from mobile devices with relatively small screens and often stringent bandwidth requirements. Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will signiﬁcantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional LSTM recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efﬁcient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32×32 thumbnails, our LSTM-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) JPEG, JPEG2000 and WebP, with a storage size that is reduced by 10 /\\% or more.},

First, we show that training with a pixel-wise loss weighted by SSIM increases reconstruction quality according to several metrics. Second, we modify the recurrent architecture to improve spatial diffusion, which allows the network to more effectively capture and propagate image information through the network’s hidden state. Finally, in addition to lossless entropy coding, we use a spatially adaptive bit allocation algorithm to more efﬁciently use the limited number of bits to encode visually complex image regions.

abstract={We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more ﬂexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difﬁcult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufﬁcient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efﬁcient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.},

title={A Joint Segmentation and Classification Framework for Sentence Level Sentiment Classification},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation and classiﬁcation framework for sentence-level sentiment classiﬁcation. It is widely recognized that phrasal information is crucial for sentiment classiﬁcation. However, existing sentiment classiﬁcation algorithms typically split a sentence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent sentiment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as “not bad,” “bad” and “a great deal of,” “great”. We address this issue by developing a joint framework for sentence-level sentiment classiﬁcation. It simultaneously generates useful segmentations and predicts sentence-level polarity based on the segmentation results. Speciﬁcally, we develop a candidate generation model to produce segmentation candidates of a sentence; a segmentation ranking model to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classiﬁcation; and a classiﬁcation model for predicting the sentiment polarity of a segmentation. We train the joint framework directly from sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without using any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. We conduct experiments for sentiment classiﬁcation on two benchmark datasets: a tweet dataset and a review dataset. Experimental results show that: 1) our method performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods on both datasets; 2) joint modeling segmentation and classiﬁcation outperforms pipelined baseline methods in various experimental settings.},

abstract={Different types of sentences express sentiment in very different ways. Traditional sentence-level sentiment classiﬁcation research focuses on one-technique-ﬁts-all solution or only centers on one special type of sentences. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which ﬁrst classiﬁes sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we ﬁnd that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to ﬁrst apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classiﬁcation. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classiﬁcation datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classiﬁcation can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.},

abstract={Convolutional neural networks play an increasingly important role in computer vision tasks, especially in the ﬁeld of visual object recognition. Many prominent models, such as Inception, Maxout, ResNet, and NIN, have been proposed to signiﬁcantly improve recognition performance. Inspired from those models, we propose a novel module called self-adaptive module (SAM). SAM consists of four passes and one selector. Speciﬁcally, the four passes include two direct passes with different receptive ﬁelds and depths, one residual pass, and one Maxout pass. Actually, the residual pass is used to speed up convergence, while we take advantage of the Maxout pass to enhance approximate capabilities of SAM. The selector is further designed to help choose reasonable output. Basically, SAM is intended to simplify design of any new deep learning architecture, since it no longer requires consideration of how to select receptive ﬁelds and depths. Our SAM is tested on the visual object recognition datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR100, MNIST, and SVHN. The experimental results demonstrate that the SAM-Net has superior recognition performances on the four benchmarks, which achieve test errors of 5.76///////\\%, 28.56///////\\%, 0.31///////\\%, and 1.98///////\\%, respectively.},

abstract={It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: 1) the slow gradientbased learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and 2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these traditional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for singlehidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on realworld benchmarking function approximation and classiﬁcation problems including large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce best generalization performance in some cases and can learn much faster than traditional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.},

title={On Deep Learning for Trust-Aware Recommendations in Social Networks},
abstract={With the emergence of online social networks, the social network-based recommendation approach is popularly used. The major beneﬁt of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user’s trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users’ interests and their trusted friends’ interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.},

Feature selection based on information theory is a popular approach due its computational efﬁciency, scalability in terms of the dataset dimensionality, and independence from the classiﬁer. Common drawbacks of this approach are the lack of information about the interaction between the features and the classiﬁer, and the selection of redundant and irrelevant features. The latter is due to the limitations of the employed goal functions leading to overestimation of the feature signiﬁcance.},

abstract={Deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations are currently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR100, MNIST, and SVHN). The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activation functions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with the use of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classiﬁcation of similar input examples. During the training process, these subnetworks avoid overﬁtting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they must share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we have made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance of such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial distribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear activation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear activation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can result in a signiﬁcant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions. Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial distribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the introduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these activation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with a relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch normalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models. We show that by introducing maxout and batch normalisation units to the network in network model results in a model that produces classiﬁcation results that are better than or comparable to the current state of the art in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets.},

abstract={The emergent machine learning technique—extreme learning machines (ELMs)—has become a hot area of research over the past years, which is attributed to the growing research activities and signiﬁcant contributions made by numerous researchers around the world. Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that (1) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes/neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes/ neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc.). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; (2) ELM is proposed for both generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward network and multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks (including biological neural networks); (3) homogeneous architecture-based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary/multi-class) classiﬁcation. (4) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks either.},

abstract={Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parameters are randomly generated and the output weights are analytically computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classiﬁcation and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via 1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before ﬁnal decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are ﬁxed without ﬁne-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efﬁciency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classiﬁcation data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing stateof-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further conﬁrm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.},

abstract={Over the past two decades, the feedforward neural network (FNN) optimization has been a key interest among the researchers and practitioners of multiple disciplines. The FNN optimization is often viewed from the various perspectives: the optimization of weights, network architecture, activation nodes, learning parameters, learning environment, etc. Researchers adopted such diﬀerent viewpoints mainly to improve the FNN’s generalization ability. The gradient-descent algorithm such as backpropagation has been widely applied to optimize the FNNs. Its success is evident from the FNN’s application to numerous real-world problems. However, due to the limitations of the gradient-based optimization methods, the metaheuristic algorithms including the evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., are still being widely explored by the researchers aiming to obtain generalized FNN for a given problem. This article attempts to summarize a broad spectrum of FNN optimization methodologies including conventional and metaheuristic approaches. This article also tries to connect various research directions emerged out of the FNN optimization practices, such as evolving neural network (NN), cooperative coevolution NN, complex-valued NN, deep learning, extreme learning machine, quantum NN, etc. Additionally, it provides interesting research challenges for future research to cope-up with the present information processing era.},

title={Mutation-Based Genetic Neural Network},
abstract={Evolving gradient-learning artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a popular approach to address the local optima and design problems of ANN. The typical approach is to combine the strength of backpropagation (BP) in weight learning and EA’s capability of searching the architecture space. However, the BP’s “gradient descent” approach requires a highly computer-intensive operation that relatively restricts the search coverage of EA by compelling it to use a small population size. To address this problem, we utilized mutation-based genetic neural network (MGNN) to replace BP by using the mutation strategy of local adaptation of evolutionary programming (EP) to effect weight learning. The MGNN’s mutation enables the network to dynamically evolve its structure and adapt its weights at the same time. Moreover, MGNN’s EP-based encoding scheme allows for a ﬂexible and less restricted formulation of the ﬁtness function and makes ﬁtness computation fast and efﬁcient. This makes it feasible to use larger population sizes and allows MGNN to have a relatively wide search coverage of the architecture space. MGNN implements a stopping criterion where overﬁtness occurrences are monitored through “sliding-windows” to avoid premature learning and overlearning. Statistical analysis of its performance to some well-known classiﬁcation problems demonstrate its good generalization capability. It also reveals that locally adapting or scheduling the strategy parameters embedded in each individual network may provide a proper balance between the local and global searching capabilities of MGNN.},

ELM theories and algorithms argue that “random hidden neurons” capture the essence of some brain learning mechanisms as well as the intuitive sense that the eﬃciency of brain learning need not rely on computing power of neurons.

abstract={This paper introduces a methodology for neural network global optimization. The aim is the simultaneous optimization of multilayer perceptron (MLP) network weights and architectures, in order to generate topologies with few connections and high classiﬁcation performance for any data sets. The approach combines the advantages of simulated annealing, tabu search and the backpropagation training algorithm in order to generate an automatic process for producing networks with high classiﬁcation performance and low complexity. Experimental results obtained with four classiﬁcation problems and one prediction problem has shown to be better than those obtained by the most commonly used optimization techniques.},

@article{2006TsaiTuning,
pages={69--80},
abstract={In this paper, a hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network. The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.},

abstract={Ant colony optimization (ACO) has been successfully applied to classiﬁcation, where the aim is to build a model that captures the relationships between the input attributes and the target class in a given domain’s dataset. The constructed classiﬁcation model can then be used to predict the unknown class of a new pattern. While artiﬁcial neural networks are one of the most widely used models for pattern classiﬁcation, their application is commonly restricted to fully connected three-layer topologies. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, ANN-Miner, which uses ACO to learn the structure of feed-forward neural networks. We report computational results on 40 benchmark datasets for several variations of the algorithm. Performance is compared to the standard three-layer structure trained with two different weight-learning algorithms (back propagation, and the ACOR algorithm), and also to a greedy algorithm for learning NN structures. A nonparametric Friedman test is used to determine statistical signiﬁcance. In addition, we compare our proposed algorithm with NEAT, a prominent evolutionary algorithm for evolving neural networks, as well as three different well-known state-of-the-art classiﬁers, namely the C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm, the Ripper classiﬁcation rule induction algorithm, and support vector machines.},

Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given <text, audio> pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-tosequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it’s substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.},

abstract={Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixelsto-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efﬁcient inference and learning. We deﬁne and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classiﬁcation networks (AlexNet [19], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by ﬁne-tuning [4] to the segmentation task. We then deﬁne a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, ﬁne layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20 /\\% relative improvement to 62.2 /\\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one ﬁfth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract={In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

abstract={Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X → Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y → X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to enforce F (G(X)) ≈ X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transﬁguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

Autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, model local structure at the expense of global latent structure and slow iterative sampling, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.},

Buy Operations Management, 8th edition with MyOMLab access card (ISBN 9781292098777) if you need access to MyOMLab as well, and save money on this resource. You will also need a course ID from your instructor to access MyOMLab. Operations management is important, exciting, challenging … and everywhere you look! Important, because it enables organizations to provide services and products that we all need Exciting, because it is central to constant changes in customer preference, networks of supply and demand, and developments in technology Challenging, because solutions must be must be financially sound, resource-efficient, as well as environmentally and socially responsible And everywhere, because in our daily lives, whether at work or at home, we all experience and manage processes and operations. New features: There are now more than 110 of the popular ‘Operations in Practice’ examples throughout the book, over 40 /\\% of which are new. The importance of sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been emphasized further, and included throughout the book. We have even further strengthened the emphasis on the idea that ‘operations management’ is relevant to every type of business and all functional areas of the organization. Many new ideas in operations management have been incorporated, including the ‘three level’ approach to performance, the relationship between innovation, creativity and design, crowdsourcing, ideas management, business ecosystems, triadic relationships, office layout, telecommuting and organisational ‘ambidexterity’. However, we have retained the emphasis on the foundations of the subject. Six of the 19 cases at the end of the chapter are new (but the old ones are still available on the web site), and provide an up-to-date selection of operations issues. Operations Management focuses on the sustainable and socially responsible imperatives of operations management, using over 120 cases and illustrations of real-life operations around the world, including Apple, Médecins Sans Frontières, Amazon, Ecover, Dyson, Disneyland Paris, Google, The North Face, and many more. This is 24-carat excellence'Par Åhlström, Torsten and Ragnar Söderberg Chair of Business Administration, Stockholm School of Economics 'Operations Management is engaging and accessible, but it never dumbs-down. The book is comprehensive, but not overwhelming. Students hold on to this one; it’s a ‘keeper’.'Michael Shulver, Birmingham Business School 'This continues to be the definitive operations Management text … written by the masters of the field!'Dr Ross Ritchie, Lecturer in Operations Management, Loughborough University 'An essential text packed full of up-to-date examples that really bring the subject to life'Claire Moxham, University of Liverpool Management School 'An excellent book for those studying operations management.

A solution to automatically colorize raw line art would have many practical applications. We propose a setup utilizing two networks in tandem: a color prediction network based only on outlines, and a shading network conditioned on both outlines and a color scheme. We present processing methods to limit information passed in the color scheme, improving generalization. Finally, we demonstrate natural-looking results when colorizing outlines from scratch, as well as from a messy, user-deﬁned color scheme.},

These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

abstract={We present a neural network model for polyphonic music transcription. The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language model. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony or the number or type of instruments. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and compare their performance to two popular state-of-the-art acoustic models. We also present an efﬁcient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate the model’s performance on the MAPS dataset and show that the proposed model outperforms state-ofthe-art transcription systems.},

This article attempts to provide a comprehensive comparison of these databases to answer frequent questions which researchers ask, such as: How Web of Science and Scopus are different? In which aspects these two databases are similar? Or, if the researchers are forced to choose one of them, which one should they prefer? For answering these questions, these two databases will be compared based on their qualitative and quantitative characteristics.},

abstract={The Institute for Scientific Information’s (ISI) citation databases have been used for decades as a starting point and often as the only tools for locating citations and/or conducting citation analyses. ISI databases (or Web of Science [WoS]), however, may no longer be sufficient because new databases and tools that allow citation searching are now available. Using citations to the work of 25 library and information science faculty members as a case study, this paper examines the effects of using Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) on the citation counts and rankings of scholars as measured by WoS. Overall, more than 10,000 citing and purportedly citing documents were examined. Results show that Scopus significantly alters the relative ranking of those scholars that appear in the middle of the rankings and that GS stands out in its coverage of conference proceedings as well as international, non-English language journals. The use of Scopus and GS, in addition to WoS, helps reveal a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the scholarly impact of authors. WoS data took about 100 hours of collecting and processing time, Scopus consumed 200 hours, and GS a grueling 3,000 hours.},

The aim of the study was to identify key elements to comprehend the systemic structure of interaction among the ties of this chain. The study was held by a team of specialists over ﬁve months, including 15 meetings. Discussions were based on quantitative and qualitative data and a systemic map was constructed and reﬁned. Based on this modeling, four different prospective scenarios were comparatively analyzed in order to propose strategic actions to promote the sustainability and competitiveness of the chain. The results were then presented to two different groups of external specialists in order to validate the conclusions drawn and the proposals. Both groups agreed with the ideas presented. The paper is constructed as follows: a brief introduction focusing on contextual elements of the biodiesel production in Brazil and in Rio Grande do Sul; some background material regarding agroindustrial production chains and an overview of the biodiesel production chain of interest; a description of the method used to perform the research; main results and discussion; and conclusions. With this paper the authors also hope to contribute to the discussion regarding competitiveness and sustainability of biofuel chains in Brazil.},

Pre-salt oil lies in reserves located below large and thick salt layers found offshore Brazil, along the coast from the states of Espírito Santo to Santa Catarina, in deep and ultra-deep waters, and situated below 3-to-4-km-thick rock layers, under the seabed. The investigations carried out so far in some pre-salt areas have shown that giant and super-giant fields are likely to exist. Such fields could place Brazil among the leading oil producers as they are thought to hold up to 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil equivalent – boe (sum of oil and natural gas), and are likely to yield from 70 to 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This article deals with the geological conditions and the past scenario in which pre-salt reserves were formed, the characteristics of the oil system, estimated reserves, exploration and production.},

abstract={The Iron ///////\\& Steel industry is one of the biggest industrial CO2 emitters in the European Union. The present work analyzes the potential for the improvement of the energy efﬁciency and CO2 emission reduction for this sector up to 2030. Three scenarios are analyzed: baseline scenario (BS) representing the current evolution of this sector and two alternative scenarios (AS1 and AS2) to study the sensitivity of fuel and resource prices and CO2 emission prices. In the integrated production route all the scenarios highlight the importance of breakthrough technologies, such as Top Gas Recycling, to obtain performance improvement in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In the secondary production route conditions under BS scenario are enough for a suitable incorporation of the best technologies in this route making insensitive the possible incentives due to higher prices in fuel and resources or CO2 emissions.},

abstract={In the early 2000s the context of the pre-salt formations was conceptual geological models of possible oil bearing reservoirs underneath a thick salt layer, many technical challenges, uncertainties and risks. Past only eight years from first discovery (2006), there are nine production systems, FPSOs, in operation, reaching an average oil rate of more than 700 thousand barrels per day and a cumulative production greater than 400 million barrels of oil, through 34 production wells. To optimize recovery, the first desulfated sea water and gas injectors were started. But these impressive numbers cannot be taken from granted: although nature has revealed prolific reservoirs, much experience, talent, planning and perseverance were necessary.},

abstract={Forecasting of production in unconventional prospects has gained a lot of attention in the recent years. The key challenges in unconventional reservoirs have been the requirement to put online a) a large number of wells in a short period of time, b) well productivity significantly driven by completion characteristics and that c) the physics of fluid flow in these prospects still remain uncertain. In this paper, machine learning algorithms are used to forecast production for existing and new wells in unconventional assets using inputs like geological maps, production history, pressure data and operational constraints. One of the most popular Machine Learning methods – Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed for this purpose. ANN can learn from large volume of data points without assuming a predetermined model and can adapt to newer data as and when it becomes available. The workflow involves using these data sets to train and optimize the ANN model which, subsequently, is used to predict the well production performance of both existing wells using their own history and new wells by using the history of nearby wells which were drilled in analogous geological locations. The proposed technique requires users to do less data conditioning and model building and focus more on analyzing what-if scenarios and determining the well performance.},

abstract={This paper presents the successful history of Lula NE Pilot Project, a challenging megaproject with an aggressive time-driven schedule, faster than industry average, that demanded new technology development in a scenario of uncertainty. The area is part of the supergiant Lula field, located in the pre-salt region of Santos Basin, Southeast Brazil, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, in 2000 m water depth. It is a joint venture with Petrobras as the Operator, and BG E///////\\&P Brasil and Petrogal Brasil as partners. The project was designed as a Pilot aiming to test some new concepts for the production development in the pre-salt area. In terms of subsea gathering system, an innovative concept was deployed, combining flexible flowlines lying on sea floor, with rigid steel catenary risers (SCR) supported by a buoy positioned 250 m below sea level. The drainage plan considered eight oil producers, some of them with intelligent completion, one gas / CO2 injection well and five water alternating gas (WAG) injectors (two subsea WAG manifolds were also installed). A balanced approach between data acquisition and facilities flexibility made possible to face the many reservoir and production uncertainties. Details of the development concept will be discussed, as well as the main results obtained so far, highlighting the strategies adopted in order to mitigate risks and the influence of the acquired information to the following projects in the area.},

abstract={In order to build prospective scenarios for biodiesel industry in Brazil, with a sustainable perspective, it was necessary to develop a cross-disciplinary work to include Sachs’ dimensions of sustainability into the scenarios method. This meant linking concepts from different disciplines, without transforming it in a new discipline. In order to support the proposition for the new method, a study case is presented, the framework for the biodiesel scenarios in Brazil, by 2030. An in-depth interview was used to test the proposition of having the sustainability dimensions as driving forces. The result was the identiﬁcation of a critical uncertainty composed of various aspects related the response to climate change and environmental conservation. The scenario storylines that were developed based on the critical uncertainties showed that sustainable options for the future are possible if the mental maps are enlarged to see beyond the business as usual.},

abstract={Drilling problems such as stick slip vibration/hole cleaning, pipe failures, loss of circulation, BHA whirl, stuck pipe incidents, excessive torque and drag, low ROP, bit wear, formation damage and borehole instability, and the drilling of highly tortuous wells have only been tackled using physics-based models. Despite the mammoth generation of real-time metadata, there is a tremendous gap between statistical based models and empirical, mathematical, and physical-based models. Data mining techniques have made prominent contributions across a broad spectrum of industries. Its value is widely appreciated in a variety of applications, but its potential has not been fully tapped in the oil and gas industry. This paper presents a review compiling several years of Data Analytics applications in the drilling operations. This review discusses the benefits, deficiencies of the present practices, challenges, and novel applications under development to overcome industry deficiencies. This study encompasses a comprehensive compilation of data mining algorithms and industry applications from a predictive analytics standpoint using supervised and unsupervised advanced analytics algorithms to identify hidden patterns and help mitigate drilling challenges. Traditional data preparation and analysis methods are not sufficiently capable of rapid information extraction and clear visualization of big complicated data sets. Due to the petroleum industry's unfulfilled demand, Machine Learning (ML)-assisted industry workflow in the fields of drilling optimization and real time parameter analysis and mitigation is presented.},

abstract={A large variety of wheat gluten based bioplastics, which were plasticized with glycerol, were subjected to biodegradation. The materials covered the total range available for the biochemical control parameter Fi, which expresses the percentage of aggregated proteins. This quantity can be related to the density of covalent crosslinks in the wheat gluten network, which are induced by technological treatments. The biodegradability tests were performed in liquid medium (modiﬁed Sturm test) and in farmland soil. All gluten materials were fully degraded after 36 days in aerobic fermentation and within 50 days in farmland soil. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed between the samples. The mineralization half-life time of 3.8 days in the modiﬁed Sturm test situated gluten materials among fast degrading polymers. The tests of microbial inhibition experiments revealed no toxic eﬀects of the modiﬁed gluten or of its metabolites. Thus, the protein bulk of wheat gluten materials is non-toxic and fully biodegradable, whatever the technological process applied.},

abstract={Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have recently been the focus of attention as a biodegradable and biocompatible substitute for conventional non degradable plastics. The cost of large-scale production of these polymers has inhibited its widespread use. Thus, economical, large-scale production of PHAs is currently being studied intensively. Various bacterial strains, either wild-type or recombinant have been utilized with a wide spectrum of utilizable carbon sources. New fermentation strategies have been developed for the efﬁcient production of PHAs at high concentration and productivity. With the current advances, PHAs can now be produced to a concentration of 80 g L−1 with productivities greater than 4 g PHA L−1 h−1. These advances will further lower the production cost of PHAs and allow this family of polymers to become a leading biodegradable polymer in the near future. This review describes the properties of PHAs, their uses, the various attempts towards the production of PHAs, focusing on the utilization of cheap substrates and the development of different fermentation strategies for the production of these polymers, an essential step forward towards their widespread use.},

abstract={Bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are polyesters accumulated as carbon and energy storage materials under limited growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon sources. They have been developed as biomaterials with unique properties for the past many years being considered as a potential substitute for conventional non-degradable plastics. Due to the increasing concern towards global climate change, depleting petroleum resource and problems with an utilization of a growing number of synthetic plastics, PHAs have gained much more attention from industry and research. These environmentally friendly microbial polymers have great potential in biomedical, agricultural, and industrial applications. However, their production on a large scale is still limited. This paper describes the backgrounds of PHAs and discussed the current state of knowledge on the polyhydroxyalkanoates. Ability of bacteria to convert different carbon sources to PHAs, the opportunities and challenges of their introduction to global market as valuable renewable products have been also discussed.},

abstract={Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biopolyesters, stored within cells as energy storage materials by various microorganisms. Due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, PHAs have a wide range of applications in various industries such as biomedical sector including tissue engineering, bio-implant patches, drug delivery, surgery and wound dressing. PHAs are green plastics and they have positive social and environmental impact when compared with conventional plastics in terms of production and recycling. Moreover, PHAs do not possess acute and chronic health eﬀects when used in vivo. These bioplastics represent a renewable and sustainable resource to reduce landﬁll requirements without being persistence or causing pollution. A wide range of carbon sources, bacterial strains, fermentation conditions and recovery methods have been purposed by various researchers for better yield and economical perspectives. Recent advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering has led to the production of PHAs from non-PHAs producing strains with no toxins. Progression in recovery techniques has improved the extraction eﬃcacy from biomass with high purity. This review outlines production and characteristics of PHAs, developments in their production, and applications in various industries including nanotechnology.},

abstract={Bioplastic based on starch as the matrix and cellulose nanocrystals from rice straw as reinforcing filler were prepared in this study. The isolation of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) followed a series of steps: delignification, sulfuric acid hydrolysis, and sonication. The process afforded short, rod-like CNCs with particle diameter ranging from 10 to 12 nm and crystallinity index of 76.1 /\\%. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the CNCs also confirmed absorption patterns typical of cellulose and the removal of silica. Bioplastic with different starch-to-CNC ratios were prepared by solution casting and evaporation method. Scanning electron micrographs of the films showed uniform dispersion of CNC in the starch matrix. Mechanical tests revealed that both tensile strength and modulus significantly increased with increasing CNC load while percent elongation decreased. The moisture uptake of the films reinforced with CNC also decreased an indication of improvement in water resistance. However, the thermal stability of the films decreased by the addition of CNC.},

Even though the principle of using such materials with improved environmental credentials is sound, it is down to the users’ appreciation of those materials that ultimately determine their commercial success.

Here, we investigate the presence of microplastics in two species of commercially grown bivalves: Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea gigas. Microplastics were recovered from the soft tissues of both species. At time of human consumption, M. edulis contains on average 0.36 ± 0.07 particles gÀ1 (wet weight), while a plastic load of 0.47 ± 0.16 particles gÀ1 ww was detected in C. gigas. As a result, the annual dietary exposure for European shellﬁsh consumers can amount to 11,000 microplastics per year. The presence of marine microplastics in seafood could pose a threat to food safety, however, due to the complexity of estimating microplastic toxicity, estimations of the potential risks for human health posed by microplastics in food stuffs is not (yet) possible.},

Though their presence has been difﬁcult to adequately ascertain, due to the inherent technical difﬁculties for isolating and quantifying them, there is an overall consensus that these are not only present in the environment –either directly released or as the result of weathering of larger fragments – but that they also pose a signiﬁcant threat to the environment and human health, as well. The reduced size of these particulates (b 1 μm) makes them susceptible of ingestion by organisms that are at the base of the food-chain.

abstract={Bioplastics play an increasingly important role for consumer products. These new materials might increase product sustainability but they are currently confined to niche markets. While research has gained important insight into the technical challenges, few studies to date explore the behavioral aspects for product developers as they move to employ bioplastics in their development efforts. This manuscript reports the findings of a grounded inductive study based on interview data with 32 product developers in the consumer goods industry. The Theory of Planned Behavior is employed to guide the research and provide a theoretical background to derive implications. The study finds that behavioral challenges impede the increased use of bioplastics. Product developers experience a lack of perceived behavioral control and struggle with doubts about the environmental benefits and incurring trade-offs of bioplastics with respect to the Triple Bottom Line. While product developers are intrinsically motivated to make more use of bioplastics, they often refrain from bringing products to the mass market due to uncertainties of customer receptiveness and fears of greenwashing allegations. Implications for industry and research are detailed.},

abstract={The democratization of personal fabrication technologies in parallel to the rising desire of individuals for personalizing their products offers great opportunities to experiment with advanced, distributed and shared production processes as well as design new materials. In this article, we introduce the notion of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Materials, which are created through individual or collective self-production practices, often by techniques and processes of the designer‟s own invention. They can be totally new materials, modified, or further developed versions of existing materials. In order to provide an operational vocabulary to discuss DIY materials, we have collected 27 DIY material cases developed in the last five years. We group the collected cases under two main categories: (1) DIY new materials: which focus on creative material ingredients (e.g. a material made of dried, blended waste citrus peel combined with natural binders); and (2) DIY new identities for conventional materials: which focus on new production techniques, giving new expressions to existing materials (i.e. they do not necessarily contain new ingredients, such as 3D printed metal). Grounded on the commonalities of collected cases, we discuss the design opportunities, including new aesthetic impressions offered through DIY material design practices.},

Several designers are now ‘growing’ their own materials. Despite the large interest shown, this emerging material practice is still scarcely understood in design literature. The aim of this paper is to shed light on what it means to design with growing organisms as collaborators, identifying the defining traits of this novel, designerly way of ‘doing materials’. To do so, we first compare this specific approach to the approaches of others working in the intersections of biology and design. In this way, we outline the boundaries of Growing Design, defining its unique characteristics. We then provide detailed descriptions of three classes of Growing Materials: fungal, bacterial and algal materials. For each class, we bring two examples of designers utilizing these materials for industrial design purposes. This helps to further explain what truly distinguishes Growing Materials from other conventional materials and to understand the challenges in working with them. Finally, this discussion enables us to set out a research agenda for Growing Design, supporting the development of these materials for industrial production.},

abstract={Biotechnology offers exciting opportunities for novel and more sustainable alternatives for the design and manufacturing of products. One of the most promising approaches is the fabrication of materials from living organisms, such as fungi and bacteria. An increasing number of designers are engaging in this "Growing Design" practice, exploring the unique potentials of the grown materials for product design. In Growing Design, designers operate in interdisciplinary contexts, engaging in early stage material developments. Despite the widespread interest towards Growing Design, no systematic study has been conducted so far to understand how this practice unfolds and its contribution to the progression towards cleaner production. To this end, eight recognized professionals in the field were interviewed. The results illustrate how the conception of materials in design evolves when designers co-perform with biological organisms. This alters how the design process unfolds and the mindset adopted in design practice, shaping a novel, systemic vision on production and consumption practices. The paper further discusses the need for developing new sensibilities to face complex interdisciplinary problems in Growing Design and highlights the role designers can take in developing new materials for sustainable production.},

abstract={From the moment of purchase, pristine objects are subjected to an array of stimuli including wear, impact, heat, light, water and air which alter their tactile and aesthetic properties. Material change is often regarded as ‘damage’ or ‘degradation’, but has potential to be used as a tool to engender emotional engagement to an object. We present a framework for designers to better understand how materials change with use, and in turn how people respond to materials as they change. Key challenges are identified which must be overcome to use this framework in design practice – people’s physical interaction with objects is poorly understood, it is difficult to simulate material change, materials resources for designers do not provide information about material change, and people’s responses to aged materials depend on a complex web of interacting factors.},

abstract={Natural ﬁber reinforced polymer composites have emerged as a potential environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternative to synthetic ﬁber reinforced composites. Therefore, in the past decade, a number of major industries, such as the automotive, construction and packaging industries, have shown a considerable interest in the progress of new natural ﬁber reinforced composite materials. The availability of natural ﬁbers and the ease of manufacturing have tempted researchers to study their feasibility of their application as reinforcement and the extent to which they satisfy the required speciﬁcations in tribological applications. However, less information concerning the tribological performance of natural ﬁber reinforced composite material is available in the literature. Hence, the aim of this bibliographic review is to demonstrate the tribological behavior of natural ﬁber reinforced composites and ﬁnd a knowledge about their usability for various applications that tribology plays a dominant role. This review presents the reported work on natural ﬁber reinforced composites with special reference to the type of ﬁbers, matrix polymers, treatment of ﬁbers and test parameters. The results show that composites reinforced with natural ﬁbers have an improvement in tribological properties and their properties are comparable with conventional ﬁbers. In addition, ﬁber treatment and ﬁber orientation are two important factors can affect tribological properties where treated ﬁbers and normal oriented ﬁbers exhibit better friction and wear behavior. This review is trying to evaluate the effect of test parameter including normal load and sliding speed on tribological properties, and the results vary based on type of reinforcement. Generally, due to their positive economic and environmental aspects, as well as their good tribological properties, natural composites are showing a good potential for employing in several applications.},

This need for new green materials has led to the utilization of composites made from raw natural fibers and polymer matrices, and this has become one of the most widely investigated research topics in recent times. Natural fiber composites are an alternative for replacing environmentally harmful synthetic materials and help control pollution problems. In addition, they are low cost, have better mechanical properties and require low production energy consumption. Also, using such materials in construction works, it is possible to improve the sustainability by eliminating construction wastes. Keeping in view all the benefits of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites, this paper first discusses various fabrication techniques employed for the production of these composites and then presents a detailed review of the research devoted to the analysis of their structure and properties by a variety of characterization techniques.},

abstract={In recent years, much attention has been focused on research to replace petroleum-based commodity plastics, in a cost-effective manner, with biodegradable materials offering competitive mechanical properties. Biopolymers have been considered as the most promising materials for this purpose. However, they generally present poor mechanical properties regarding processability and end-use application, since the fragility and brittleness exhibited during thermoformation can limit their potential for application. In order to overcome this problem, plasticizers are added to provide the necessary workability to biopolymers. This class of products became more visible when biodegradable additives and plasticizers also became the focus of material scientists. The use of natural and/or biodegradable plasticizers, with low toxicity and good compatibility with several plastics, resins, rubber and elastomers in substitution of conventional plasticizers, such as phthalates and other synthetic conventional plasticizers attracted the market along with the increasing worldwide trend towards use of biopolymers.

The system adds a CNN-BLSTM acoustic model to the set of model architectures we combined previously, and includes character-based and dialog session aware LSTM language models in rescoring. For system combination we adopt a twostage approach, whereby subsets of acoustic models are ﬁrst combined at the senone/frame level, followed by a word-level voting via confusion networks. We also added a confusion network rescoring step after system combination. The resulting system yields a 5.1 /\\% word error rate on the 2000 Switchboard evaluation set.},

abstract={Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.},

abstract={Recurrent Neural Networks are showing much promise in many sub-areas of natural language processing, ranging from document classiﬁcation to machine translation to automatic question answering. Despite their promise, many recurrent models have to read the whole text word by word, making it slow to handle long documents. For example, it is difﬁcult to use a recurrent network to read a book and answer questions about it. In this paper, we present an approach of reading text while skipping irrelevant information if needed. The underlying model is a recurrent network that learns how far to jump after reading a few words of the input text. We employ a standard policy gradient method to train the model to make discrete jumping decisions. In our benchmarks on four different tasks, including number prediction, sentiment analysis, news article classiﬁcation and automatic Q /\\&A, our proposed model, a modiﬁed LSTM with jumping, is up to 6 times faster than the standard sequential LSTM, while maintaining the same or even better accuracy.},

abstract={Adversarial training provides a means of regularizing supervised learning algorithms while virtual adversarial training is able to extend supervised learning algorithms to the semi-supervised setting. However, both methods require making small perturbations to numerous entries of the input vector, which is inappropriate for sparse high-dimensional inputs such as one-hot word representations. We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to the text domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrent neural network rather than to the original input itself. The proposed method achieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised and purely supervised tasks. We provide visualizations and analysis showing that the learned word embeddings have improved in quality and that while training, the model is less prone to overﬁtting.},

abstract={Programming by example (PBE) systems allow end users to easily create programs by providing a few input-output examples to specify their intended task. The system attempts to generate a program in a domain speciﬁc language (DSL) that satisﬁes the given examples. However, a key challenge faced by existing PBE techniques is to ensure the robustness of the programs that are synthesized from a small number of examples, as these programs often fail when applied to new inputs. This is because there can be many possible programs satisfying a small number of examples, and the PBE system has to somehow rank between these candidates and choose the correct one without any further information from the user. In this work we present a different approach to PBE in which the system avoids making a ranking decision at the synthesis stage, by instead synthesizing a disjunctive program that includes the many possible top-ranked programs as possible alternatives and selects between these different choices upon execution on a new input. This delayed choice brings the important beneﬁt of comparing the possible outputs produced by the different disjuncts on a given input at execution time. We present a generic framework for synthesizing such disjunctive programs in arbitrary DSLs, and describe two concrete implementations of disjunctive synthesis in the practical domains of data extraction from plain text and HTML documents. We present an evaluation showing the signiﬁcant increase in robustness achieved with our disjunctive approach, as illustrated by an increase from 59///////\\% to 93///////\\% of tasks for which correct programs can be learnt from a single example.},

abstract={Impressive image captioning results (i.e., an objective description for an image) are achieved with plenty of training pairs. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate the creation of narrative paragraph for a photo stream. This task is even more challenging due to the difﬁculty in modeling an ordered photo sequence and in generating a relevant paragraph with expressive language style for storytelling. The difﬁculty can even be exacerbated by the limited training data, so that existing approaches almost focus on searchbased solutions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a sequence-to-sequence modeling approach with reinforcement learning and adversarial training. First, to model the ordered photo stream, we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network as story generator, which is optimized by reinforcement learning with rewards. Second, to generate relevant and story-style paragraphs, we design the rewards with two critic networks, including a multi-modal and a languagestyle discriminator. Third, we further consider the story generator and reward critics as adversaries. The generator aims to create indistinguishable paragraphs to human-level stories, whereas the critics aim at distinguishing them and further improving the generator by policy gradient. Experiments on three widely-used datasets show the effectiveness, against state-of-the-art methods with relative increase of 20.2///////\\% by METEOR. We also show the subjective preference for the proposed approach over the baselines through a user study with 30 human subjects.},

title={The Timeless Way of Building},
abstract={The theory of architecture implicit in our world today, Christopher Alexander believes, is bankrupt. More and more people are aware that something is deeply wrong. Yet the power of present-day ideas is so great that many feel uncomfortable, even afraid, to say openly that they dislike what is happening, because they are afraid to seem foolish, afraid perhaps that they will be laughed at. Now, at last, there is a coherent theory which describes in modern terms an architecture as ancient as human society itself. The Timeless Way of Building is the introductory volume in the Center for Environmental Structure series, Christopher Alexander presents in it a new theory of architecture, building, and planning which has at its core that age-old process by which the people of a society have always pulled the order of their world from their own being. Alexander writes, "There is one timeless way of building. It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. And as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills, and as our faces are."},

author={Strang, Gilbert},
abstract={Gilbert Strang's textbooks have changed the entire approach to learning linear algebra -- away from abstract vector spaces to specific examples of the four fundamental subspaces: the column space and nullspace of A and A'. This new fifth edition has become more than a textbook for the basic linear algebra course. That is its first purpose and always will be. The new chapters about applications of the SVD, probability and statistics, and Principal Component Analysis in finance and genetics, make it also a textbook for a second course, plus a resource at work. Linear algebra has become central in modern applied mathematics. This book supports the value of understanding linear algebra. Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fifth Edition includes challenge problems to complement the review problems that have been highly praised in previous editions. The basic course is followed by eight applications: differential equations in engineering, graphs and networks, statistics, Fourier methods and the FFT, linear programming, computer graphics, cryptography, Principal Component Analysis, and singular values. Audience: Thousands of teachers in colleges and universities and now high schools are using this book, which truly explains this crucial subject. This text is for readers everywhere, with support from the websites and video lectures. Every chapter begins with a summary for efficient review. Contents: Chap. 1: Introduction to Vectors; Chap. 2: Solving Linear Equations; Chap. 3: Vector Spaces and Subspaces; Chap. 4: Orthogonality; Chap. 5: Determinants; Chap. 6: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors; Chap. 7: Singular Value Decomposition; Chap. 8: Linear Transformations; Chap. 9: Complex Vectors and Matrices; Chap. 10: Applications; Chap. 11: Numerical Linear Algebra; Chap. 12: Linear Algebra in Probability and Statistics; Matrix Factorizations; Index; Six Great Theorems.},

title={Is a Rigorous Agile Methodology the Best Development Strategy for Small Scale Tech Startups?},
abstract={Recently, Agile development processes have become popular in the software development community, and have been shown to be effective in large organizations. However, given that the communication and cooperation dynamics in startup companies are very different from that of larger, more established companies, and the fact that the initial focus of a startup might be significantly different from its ultimate goal, it is questionable whether a rigid process model that works for larger companies is appropriate in tackling the problems faced by a startup. When we scale down even further and observe the small scale startup with only a few members, many of the same problems that Agile methodology sets out to solve do not even exist. Then, for a small scale startup, is it still worth putting the resources into establishing a process model? Do the benefits of adopting an Agile methodology outweigh the opportunity cost of spending the resources elsewhere? This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an Agile methodology in a small scale tech startup and compares it to other process models, such as the Waterfall model and Lean Startup. In determining whether a rigorous agile methodology is the best development strategy for small scale tech startups, we consider the metrics of cost, time, quality, and scope in light of the particular needs of small startup organizations, and present a case study of a company that has needed to answer this very question.},

abstract={Digital startups in the early stages of their development frequently undergo innovation to their value architecture and Business Model. A set of pragmatic methods drawing on lean and agile principles has recently been proposed to support digital entrepreneurs facing Business Model Innovation (BMI), known as Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs). However, the theoretical and practical relationship between BMI and LSAs in dynamic digital environments has seldom been investigated. To fill this gap, our study draws on an exploratory multiple-case study based on three digital multisided platform startups to craft a unified framework that can disclose the relationship between BMI, LSAs and Agile Development (AD), within the context of Strategic Agility. Our findings, which emerge from the unified framework, show that LSAs can be employed as agile methods to enable Business Model Innovation in Digital Entrepreneurship. These findings are then organized around a set of propositions, with the aim of developing a research agenda directed towards integrating BMI, LSAs and AD processes and methods.},

title={What You Should Know About Megaprojects and Why: An Overview},
doi={10.1002/pmj.21409},
volume={45},
abstract={This paper takes stock of megaproject management, an emerging and hugely costly field of study, by first answering the question of how large megaprojects are by measuring them in the units of mega, giga, and tera, and concluding with how we are presently entering a new “tera era” of trillion-dollar projects. Second, total global megaproject spending is assessed, at US$6 to US$9 trillion annually, or 8///////\\% of the total global gross domestic product (GDP), which denotes the biggest investment boom in human history. Third, four “sublimes”—political, technological, economic, and aesthetic—are identified and used to explain the increased size and frequency of megaprojects. Fourth, the “iron law of megaprojects” is laid out and documented: Over budget, over time, over and over again. Moreover, the “break–fix model” of megaproject management is introduced as an explanation of the iron law. Fifth, Albert O. Hirschman's theory of the “Hiding Hand” is revisited and critiqued as unfounded and corrupting for megaproject thinking in both the academy and policy. Sixth, it is shown how megaprojects are systematically subject to “survival of the unfittest,” which explains why the worst projects get built rather than the best. Finally, it is argued that the conventional way of managing megaprojects has reached a “tension point,” in which tradition is being challenged and reform is emerging.},

abstract={Critiques of urban renewal and large-scale developments were prominent in the period 1960–80. In particular, they emphasized the negative environmental and social consequences of these schemes and especially attacked them for displacing low-income and ethnically different populations. In the 1980s and 1990s, we saw a decline in such projects in many places, responding to popular protest and intellectual dissent, along with a new emphasis on preservation. More recently, however, we see the revival of mega-projects, often connected with tourism and sports development and incorporating the designs of world-famous architects. Frequently these are on landfill or abandoned industrial sites. The symposium for which this is an introduction shows the growing convergence of North American and European projects. This convergence is visible in their physical form, their financing, and in the role played by the state in a world marked by neoliberalism. At the same time, the new projects do display a greater environmental sensitivity and commitment to urbanity than the modernist schemes of an earlier epoch. Résumé Dans la période 1960–1980, les critiques sur les aménagements à grande échelle et les grandes rénovations urbaines étaient fréquentes. Elles soulignaient notamment les conséquences environnementales et sociales néfastes de ces programmes, en leur reprochant en particulier de déplacer les populations à faible revenu ou d'appartenance ethnique différente. Dans les années 1980 et 1990, ces projets se sont faits plus rares dans bien des endroits, répondant à la contestation populaire et au désaccord des intellectuels, parallèlement à une préoccupation nouvelle pour la préservation. Dernièrement, pourtant, les mégaprojets ont réapparu, souvent associés à un aménagement touristique ou sportif et intégrant des créations d'architectes de renommée mondiale. Ils se situent fréquemment sur le site d'anciennes décharges ou usines abandonnées. Le symposium dont ce texte sert d'introduction montre la convergence croissante des projets nord-américains et européens, convergence que l'on constate dans leur forme physique, leur financement et dans le rôle que joue l'État dans un monde empreint de néolibéralisme. En même temps, les nouveaux projets affichent une sensibilitéà l'environnement et un engagement vis-à-vis de l'urbanité plus marqués que les programmes modernistes antérieurs.},

abstract={Estádio Jornalista Mário Filho, mais conhecido como Maracanã, o popular Maraca ("semelhante a um chocalho" em tupi-guarani, devido ao som de pássaros que viviam por ali), é um estádio de futebol localizado na Zona Norte do Rio de Janeiro e inaugurado em 1950, durante o mandato do então General de Divisão e Prefeito do Distrito Federal do Rio de Janeiro Marechal Ângelo Mendes de Moraes, tendo sido utilizado na Copa do Mundo de Futebol daquele ano. Desde então, o Maracanã foi palco de grandes momentos do futebol brasileiro e mundial, como o milésimo gol de Pelé, finais do Campeonato Brasileiro, Carioca de Futebol, Taça Libertadores da América e do primeiro Campeonato Mundial de Clubes da FIFA, além de competições internacionais e partidas da Seleção Brasileira. O estádio foi um dos locais de competição dos Jogos Pan-Americanos de 2007, recebendo o futebol, as cerimônias de abertura e de encerramento. Sediou futebol e as cerimônias de abertura e encerramento dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016, que foram realizados na cidade do Rio de Janeiro. Foi também o palco da partida final da Copa das Confederações de 2013 e da Copa do Mundo FIFA de 2014Ao longo do tempo, no entanto, o estádio passou a assumir caráter de espaço multiúso ao receber outros eventos como espetáculos e partidas de outros esportes, como o voleibol em uma oportunidade. Após diversas obras de modernização, a capacidade do estádio é de 78 838 espectadores, sendo o maior estádio do Brasil.},

However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as this label implies. To provide a better understanding of lean software development approaches and how they are applied in agile software development, we have examined 30 experience reports published in past agile software conferences in which experiences of applying lean approaches in agile software development were reported. The analysis identified six types of lean application. The results of our study show that lean can be applied in agile processes in different manners for different purposes. Lean concepts, principles and practices are most often used for continuous agile process improvement, with the most recent introduction being the kanban approach, introducing a continuous, flow-based substitute to time-boxed agile processes.},

The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly ﬁne details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CELEBA images at 10242. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CELEBA dataset.},

Recent work has shown that neural networks excel at this task when provided with large, labeled datasets. However, removing the reliance on human labeling remains an important open problem. To this end, we introduce the Generative Query Network (GQN), a framework within which machines learn to represent scenes using only their own sensors. The GQN takes as input images of a scene taken from different viewpoints, constructs an internal representation, and uses this representation to predict the appearance of that scene from previously unobserved viewpoints. The GQN demonstrates representation learning without human labels or domain knowledge, paving the way toward machines that autonomously learn to understand the world around them.},

abstract={We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style as synthesizing images. Code will be available at https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE .},

abstract={This major work covers almost all that has been learned about the acoustics of stringed instruments from Helmholtz's 19th-century theoretical elaborations to recent electroacoustic and holographic measurements. Many of the results presented here were uncovered by the author himself (and by his associates and students) over a 20-year period of research on the physics of instruments in the violin family. Lothar Cremer is one of the world's most respected authorities on architectural acoustics and, not incidentally, an avid avocational violinist and violist.The book―which was published in German in 1981―first of all meets the rigorous technical standards of specialists in musical acoustics. But it also serves the needs and interests of two broader groups: makers and players of stringed instruments are expressly addressed, since the implications of the mathematical formulations are fully outlined and explained; and acousticians in general will find that the work represents a textbook illustration of the application of fundamental principles and up-to-date techniques to a specific problem. The first―and longest―of the book's three parts investigates the oscillatory responses of bowed (and plucked) strings. The natural nonlinearities that derive from considerations of string torsion and bending stiffness are deftly handled and concisely modeled. The second part deals with the body of the instrument. Special attention is given to the bridge, which transmits the oscillations of the strings to the wooden body and its air cavity. In this case, linear modeling proves serviceable for the most part―a simplification that would not be possible with lute―like instruments such as the guitar. The radiation of sound from the body into the listener's space, which is treated as an extension of the instrument itself, is the subject of the book's final part.},

Our approach ﬁts a full perspective camera and a parametric 3D head model to the portrait, and then builds a 2D warp in the image plane to approximate the effect of a desired change in 3D. We show that this model is capable of correcting objectionable artifacts such as the large noses sometimes seen in “selﬁes,” or to deliberately bring a distant camera closer to the subject. This framework can also be used to re-pose the subject, as well as to create stereo pairs from an input portrait. We show convincing results on both an existing dataset as well as a new dataset we captured to validate our method.},

Thus, it has a higher mode density than the traditional kanteles. Because of the coupling of the enclosed air modes to the body, the modiﬁed kantele radiates more omni-directionally than the traditional kanteles. Consequently, the modiﬁed kantele has a higher radiation eﬃciency than the traditional kanteles when the size of the air gap is small (1-3 mm).},

abstract={The world is experiencing a data revolution to discover knowledge in big data. Large scale neural networks are one of the mainstream tools of big data analytics. Processing big data with large scale neural networks includes two phases: the training phase and the operation phase. Huge computing power is required to support the training phase. And the energy efficiency (power efficiency) is one of the major considerations of the operation phase. We first explore the computing power of GPUs for big data analytics and demonstrate an efficient GPU implementation of the training phase of large scale recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We then introduce a promising ultrahigh energy efficient implementation of neural networks' operation phase by taking advantage of the emerging memristor technique. Experiment results show that the proposed GPU implementation of RNNs is able to achieve 2 11× speed-up compared with the basic CPU implementation. And the scaled-up recurrent neural network trained with GPUs realizes an accuracy of 47 /\\% on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge, the best result achieved by a single RNN on the same dataset. In addition, the proposed memristor-based implementation of neural networks demonstrates power efficiency of > 400 GFLOPS/W and achieves energy savings of 22× on the HMAX model compared with its pure digital implementation counterpart.},

However, there are limitations in the current implementation of DNN-based acoustic modeling for speech synthesis, such as the unimodal nature of its objective function and its lack of ability to predict variances. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the use of a mixture density output layer. It can estimate full probability density functions over real-valued output features conditioned on the corresponding input features. Experimental results in objective and subjective evaluations show that the use of the mixture density output layer improves the prediction accuracy of acoustic features and the naturalness of the synthesized speech.},

abstract={We are given a video of a person performing a certain activity, from which we extract a controllable model. The model generates novel image sequences of that person, according to arbitrary user-defined control signals, typically marking the displacement of the moving body. The generated video can have an arbitrary background, and effectively capture both the dynamics and appearance of the person. The method is based on two networks. The first network maps a current pose, and a single-instance control signal to the next pose. The second network maps the current pose, the new pose, and a given background, to an output frame. Both networks include multiple novelties that enable high-quality performance. This is demonstrated on multiple characters extracted from various videos of dancers and athletes.},

A sequence to sequence neural network model used in natural language translation was adopted to encode multiple musical styles and an online survey was developed to test different techniques for sampling the output of the softmax function. The strongest results were found using a sampling technique that drew from the three most probable outputs at each subdivision of the drum pattern but the consistency of output was found to be heavily dependent on style.},

abstract={One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), rea- soning, intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, withmin- imal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally lim- ited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very ineffi- cient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Sec- ond, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learn- ing) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more ab- stract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence. 1},

This paper: 1) reviews different combinations between ANNs and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), including using EAs to evolve ANN connection weights, architectures, learning rules, and input features; 2) discusses different search operators which have been used in various EAs; and 3) points out possible future research directions. It is shown, through a considerably large literature review, that combinations between ANNs and EAs can lead to significantly better intelligent systems than relying on ANNs or EAs alone},

In this paper we present a framework for understanding and supporting efforts aimed at 'responsible innovation'. The framework was developed in part through work with one of the first major research projects in the controversial area of geoengineering, funded by the UK Research Councils. We describe this case study, and how this became a location to articulate and explore four integrated dimensions of responsible innovation: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness. Although the framework for responsible innovation was designed for use by the UK Research Councils and the scientific communities they support, we argue that it has more general application and relevance. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By emphasising the importance of design for the definition of consumers׳ needs, the restructuring of firms׳ organisational structures and strategies, and the evolution of firms׳ value creation processes, this review paper identifies relevant research gaps and questions that would benefit from future scholarly attention. In particular, it is suggested that such effort should address the analysis of how design consumption can help better comprehend consumers׳ needs; what are the implications of design thinking on the skill sets of design professionals; the organisational structure of firms, including the reconfiguration of other business functions, and their strategy; and whether and how design thinking can shape firms׳ value creation processes and contribute to the formalisation of design tasks.},

abstract={Although an abundance of academic literature positions organizational information processing as antecedent to decision making, little attention is paid to the possibility that decision making can be antecedent to certain elements of organizational information processing. Specifically, does the decision making process impact the type of organizational learning that takes place? Do different approaches to decision making alter the amount and variety of information made available to the organization, that is, the level of information overload? This paper examines incremental and comprehensive decision making to understand the effects of different decision making types on organizational learning and information overload. Incrementalism suggests that decision making should take place in small steps or increments. This approach analyzes only a few scenarios to make decisions resulting in few, if any, major organizational changes. However, comprehensive decision making requires the consideration of all possible scenarios and potential outcomes, resulting in a major overhaul of traditions and procedures within the organization. Consequently, each decision making approach has a different impact on organizational learning and information overload. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a valuable resource within operations research and management science. Various MCDA methods have been developed over the years and applied to decision problems in many different areas. The outranking approach, and in particular the family of ELECTRE methods, continues to be a popular research field within MCDA, despite its more than 40 years of existence. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of English scholarly papers on ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods is performed. Our aim is to investigate how ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods have been considered in various areas. This includes area of applications, modifications to the methods, comparisons with other methods, and general studies of the ELECTRE methods. Although a significant amount of literature on ELECTRE is in a language different from English, we focus only on English articles, because many researchers may not be able to perform a study in some of the other languages. Each paper is categorized according to its main focus with respect to ELECTRE, i.e. if it considers an application, performs a review, considers ELECTRE with respect to the problem of selecting an MCDA method or considers some methodological aspects of ELECTRE. A total of 686 papers are included in the review. The group of papers considering an application of ELECTRE consists of 544 papers, and these are further categorized into 13 application areas and a number of sub-areas. In addition, all papers are classified according to the country of author affiliation, journal of publication, and year of publication. For the group of applied papers, the distribution by ELECTRE version vs. application area and ELECTRE version vs. year of publication are provided. We believe that this paper can be a valuable source of information for researchers and practitioners in the field of MCDA and ELECTRE in particular.},

The paper identifies the effect of three pervasive technologies – biotechnology, information technology and nanotechnology – on the production of a range of sectors and their consequent environmental effects. The sectors are selected according to taxonomies of characteristics. The technological impact is assessed qualitatively in terms of changes in production scale and resource intensity and their resulting impact on industrial greenhouse gas emissions},

issn={0377-2217},
abstract={Structuring problems for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has attracted increasing attention over the past 20 years from both a conceptual and a practical perspective. This is reflected in a significant growth in the number of published applications which use a formal approach to problem structuring in combination with an analytic method for multi-criteria analysis. The problem structuring approaches (PSMs) include general methodologies such as Checkland's Soft Systems Method (SSM), Eden and Ackermann's Strategic Options Design and Analysis (SODA) and other methods that focus on a particular aspect. We carried out a literature review that covers eight PSMs (Cognitive and Causal Maps, DPSIR, Scenario Planning, SSM, Stakeholder Analysis, Strategic Choice Approach, SODA and SWOT) and seven MCDA methods (AHP, ANP, ELECTRE, MAUT, MAVT, PROMETHEE and TOPSIS). We first identified and analysed 333 articles published during 2000-2015, then selected 68 articles covering all PSM-MCDA combinations, which were studied in detail to understand the associated processes, benefits and challenges. The three PSMs most commonly combined with MCDA are SWOT, Scenario Planning and DPSIR. AHP was by far the most commonly applied MCDA method. Combining PSMs with MCDA produces a richer view of the decision situation and enables more effective support for different phases of the decision-making process. Some limitations and challenges in combining PSMs and MCDA are also identified, most importantly relating to building a value tree and assigning criteria weights.},

abstract={Future disruptive, pervasive technologies will have important consequences for industrial structure, economic growth and the environment. Drawing on theories of technological diffusion, industrial evolution and long-term technological change this paper explores the effect of the development and diffusion of two future pervasive technologies on five industrial sectors in three regions during the 21st century in terms of their effect on economic structural change. Through semi-structured interviews with over 100 experts in the two technologies, the paper quantifies the effects of future biotechnologies and nanotechnologies on the industrial structure of the EU, USA and China in 2020 and 2050. The paper finds that as a result of the development and diffusion of future biotechnologies and nanotechnologies, some industries grow whilst others decline and some new ones emerge. The evidence suggests that the effect is different across countries and time; whereas the experts commonly believe that effect of the technologies on the industrial structure of the EU and US is likely to be similar, the effect in China is considered to be less by 2020 but the same as in the EU and US by 2050. This finding has important implications for the location of production, economic growth and energy demand in the future. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This diversity leads to the blurring of the limits of crowdsourcing that may be identified virtually with any type of Internet-based collaborative activity, such as co-creation or user innovation. Varying definitions of crowdsourcing exist and therefore, some authors present certain specific examples of crowdsourcing as paradigmatic, while others present the same examples as the opposite. In this paper, existing definitions of crowdsourcing are analyzed to extract common elements and to establish the basic characteristics of any crowdsourcing initiative. Based on these existing definitions, an exhaustive and consistent definition for crowdsourcing is presented and contrasted in eleven cases.},

@article{2008PisanoWhich,
author={Pisano, Gary P. and Verganti, Roberto},
number={12},
abstract={Nowadays, virtually no companies innovate alone. Firms team up with a variety of partners, in a wide number of ways, to create new technologies, products, and services. But what is the best way to leverage the power of outsiders? To help executives answer that question, Pisano, of Harvard Business School, and Verganti, of Politecnico di Milano, developed a simple framework focused on two questions: Given your strategy, how open or closed should your network of collaborators be? And who should decide which problems to tackle and which solutions to adopt? There are four basic modes of collaboration, say the authors. An elite circle is a closed network with a hierarchical governance: One company selects the participants, defines the problem, and chooses the solution. For instance, Alessi, an Italian home-products company, invited 200 outside experts in postmodern architecture to contribute ideas for new home-product designs. An innovation mall is hierarchical but open: Anyone can post a problem or propose solutions in it, but the company posting the problem chooses the solution. An example is InnoCentive.com, an eBay-like site where companies post scientific challenges. An innovation community is open and decentralized: Anyone can propose problems, offer solutions, and decide which ideas to use -- as happens in the Linux open-source software community. A consortium is a private group of participants that operate as equals and jointly select problems, decide how to conduct work, and choose solutions. IBM has set up a number of consortia with other companies to develop next-generation semiconductor technologies. No one approach is superior; each involves strategic trade-offs. When choosing among modes, firms must weigh their advantages and challenges, and assess which will work best with their strategy, capabilities, structure, and assets.

abstract={Creative consumers (defined as customers who adapt, modify, or transform a proprietary offering) represent an intriguing paradox for business. On one hand, they can signify a black hole for future revenue, with breach of copyright and intellectual property. On the other hand, they represent a gold mine of ideas and business opportunities. Central to business is the need to create and capture value, and creative consumers demand a shift in the mindsets and business models of how firms accomplish both. Based upon their attitude and action toward customer innovation, we develop a typology of firms' stances toward creative consumers. We then consider the implications of the stances model for corporate strategy and examine a three-step approach to dealing with creative consumers: awareness, analysis, and response. ?? 2006 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

Thus, this study presents a CAD system for shoe-last rapid customized design based on the piecewise reconstruction to realize the interactive deformation and separate/global shoe-last form reuse. First, piecewise remodeling method is proposed based on the multi-layer parametric definition and contour curves are extracted from the mesh. Then, five types of proper constraints to support surface manipulation are proposed, and the draft-driven deformation by the contour curve bending can realize the interactive local surface design in free angle of view. Finally, shoe-last styles can be saved and reused globally or separately to share design results between different shoe-lasts. Experimental examples show that customized shoe-lasts can be easily and rapidly generated by adopting the parametric design methods.},

abstract={Research has shown that many innovations originate not in the manufacturer but the user domain. Internet-based toolkits for idea competitions (TIC) are a novel way for manufacturers to access innovative ideas and solutions from users. Idea competitions build on the nature of competition as a means to encourage users to participate at an open innovation process, to inspire their creativity, and to increase the quality of the submissions. When the contest ends, submissions are evaluated by an expert panel. Users whose submissions score highest receive an award from the manufacturer, which is often granted in exchange for the right to exploit the solution in its domain. Following the idea of evolutionary prototyping, we developed a TIC in cooperation with a manufacturer of sports goods. The TIC was launched as a pilot in one of the company's markets. Submissions were evaluated using the consensual assessment technique. The evaluation of this study provides suggestions for further research, but also implications for managers willing to explore TIC in their organization.},

Sector advertising levels follow a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form, and within-sector prices are dispersed with a truncated Pareto distribution. The “information hump” shows highest ad levels for intermediate attention levels. Overall, advertising is excessive, although the allocation across sectors is optimal.

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze the emerging crowd-funding phenomenon, that is a collective effort by consumers who network and pool their money together, usually via the internet, in order to invest in and support efforts initiated by other people or organizations. Successful service businesses that organize crowd-funding and act as intermediaries are emerging, attesting to the viability of this means of attracting investment. Design/methodology/approach – The research employs a “grounded theory” approach, performing an in-depth qualitative analysis of three cases involving crowd-funding initiatives: SellaBand in the music business, Trampoline in financial services, and Kapipal in non-profit services. These cases were selected to represent a diverse set of crowd-funding operations that vary in terms of risk/return for the investor and the type of payoff associated to the investment. Findings – The research addresses two research questions: how and why do consumers turn into crowd-funding participants? and how and why do service providers set up a crowd-funding initiative? Concerning the first research question, the authors' findings reveal purposes, characteristics, roles and tasks, and investment size of crowd-funding activity from the consumer's point of view. Regarding the second research question, the authors' analysis reveals purposes, service roles, and network effects of crowd-funding activity investigated from the point of view of the service organization that set up the initiative. Practical implications – The findings also have implications for service managers interested in launching and/or managing crowd-funding initiatives. Originality/value – The paper addresses an emerging phenomenon and contributes to service theory in terms of extending the consumer's role from co-production and co-creation to investment.},

abstract={Research and public policy on academic entrepreneurship are largely based on the assumption that faculty members start businesses to commercialize inventions that have been disclosed to university administrators and have been patented. In this paper, we analyze a sample of 11,572 professors and find that much academic entrepreneurship occurs outside the university intellectual property system. Specifically, about 2/3 of businesses started by academics are not based on disclosed and patented inventions. Moreover, we show that individual characteristics, departmental and organizational affiliations, and time allocation of academics that have started business outside the IP system are different from those of academics that have started businesses to exploit disclosed and patented inventions. We discuss the implications for research on and the practice of academic entrepreneurship. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

issn={0737-6782},
date={2012-03},
abstract={Generating ideas for new products used to be the exclusive domain of marketers, engineers, and/or designers. Users have only recently been recognized as an alternative source of new product ideas. Whereas some have attributed great potential to outsourcing idea generation to the “crowd” of users (“crowdsourcing”), others have clearly been more skeptical. The authors join this debate by presenting a real-world comparison of ideas actually generated by a firm's professionals with those generated by users in the course of an idea generation contest. Both professionals and users provided ideas to solve an effective and relevant problem in the consumer goods market for baby products. Executives from the underlying company evaluated all ideas (blind to their source) in terms of key quality dimensions including novelty, customer benefit, and feasibility. The study reveals that the crowdsourcing process generated user ideas that score significantly higher in terms of novelty and customer benefit, and somewhat lower in terms of feasibility. However, the average values for feasibility—in sharp contrast to novelty and customer benefit—tended to be relatively high overall, meaning that feasibility did not constitute a narrow bottleneck in this study. Even more interestingly, it is found that user ideas are placed more frequently than expected among the very best in terms of novelty and customer benefit. These findings, which are quite counterintuitive from the perspective of classic new product development (NPD) literature, suggest that, at least under certain conditions, crowdsourcing might constitute a promising method to gather user ideas that can complement those of a firm's professionals at the idea generation stage in NPD.},

@article{2013ElliotCross,
abstract={In today's global business environment, where multinational companies are pressed to increase revenues in order to survive, creativity may hold the key to ensuring their new product development (NPD) efforts lead to innovations with worldwide appeal, such as Apple's iPad and Gillette's Fusion Razor. To leverage creativity for effective global NPD, businesses want to know how cultures differ in their concepts of creativity and the impact of those differences on approaches to developing new products. Because global new products are increasingly developed in, by, and for multiple cultures, a particular need is for a culturally reflective understanding, or conceptualization, of creativity. While creativity is believed to be culturally tied, the dominant framework of creativity used in business and management assumes that creativity is culturally indifferent or insensitive. This knowledge gap is addressed by studying the role of creativity in NPD practices in a cross-cultural or global context. The study begins by first developing a culturally anchored conceptualization of creativity. Called cross-cultural creativity, the concept draws on creativity insights from the field of art and aesthetics. The concept specifies two modes of creativity, neither of which is superior to the other, called the spontaneous or S route and the divergent or D route. The S route emphasizes adaptiveness, processes, intuitiveness, and metamorphism, while the D route focuses on disruptiveness, results, rationality, and literalism. Next, this new concept is applied to NPD by positing how creativity in distinct cultures may shape NPD practices, as illustrated by Japanese and U.S. firms. Research propositions are formulated to capture these patterns, and thereafter, theoretical and practical implications of the framework and propositions are discussed. The implications center on global NPD, which is a complex enterprise involving typically more than one culture to design and develop new products for several geographic markets. The study is of interest to researchers needing a globally situated, culturally attached framework of creativity for international NPD studies, and managers seeking to exploit creativity in multinational and multicultural innovation projects.},

abstract={Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves: the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands: indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing.

Multimedia data whether graphics, audio, video data which is uncompress requires considerable transmission bandwidth and storage capacity. So this leads to the need of compression of images and all multimedia applications to save storage and transmission time.

abstract={We review more than 200 applications of neural networks in image processing and discuss the present and possible future role of neural networks, especially feed-forward neural networks, Kohonen feature maps and Hopÿeld neural networks. The various applications are categorised into a novel two-dimensional taxonomy for image processing algorithms. One dimension speciÿes the type of task performed by the algorithm: preprocessing, data reduction=feature extraction, segmentation, object recognition, image understanding and optimisation. The other dimension captures the abstraction level of the input data processed by the algorithm: pixel-level, local feature-level, structure-level, object-level, object-set-level and scene characterisation. Each of the six types of tasks poses speciÿc constraints to a neural-based approach. These speciÿc conditions are discussed in detail. A synthesis is made of unresolved problems related to the application of pattern recognition techniques in image processing and speciÿcally to the application of neural networks. Finally, we present an outlook into the future application of neural networks and relate them to novel developments. ? 2002 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={We propose to study links between three important classiﬁcation algorithms: Perceptrons, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We ﬁrst study ways to control the capacity of Perceptrons (mainly regularization parameters and early stopping), using the margin idea introduced with SVMs. After showing that under simple conditions a Perceptron is equivalent to an SVM, we show it can be computationally expensive in time to train an SVM (and thus a Perceptron) with stochastic gradient descent, mainly because of the margin maximization term in the cost function. We then show that if we remove this margin maximization term, the learning rate or the use of early stopping can still control the margin. These ideas are extended afterward to the case of MLPs. Moreover, under some assumptions it also appears that MLPs are a kind of mixture of SVMs, maximizing the margin in the hidden layer space. Finally, we present a very simple MLP based on the previous ﬁndings, which yields better performances in generalization and speed than the other models.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve object recognition accuracies of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by embedding the proposed Min-Max objective into a high layer of the models during the training process. The MinMax objective explicitly enforces the learned object feature maps to have the minimum compactness for each object manifold and the maximum margin between different object manifolds. The Min-Max objective can be universally applied to different CNN models with negligible additional computation cost. Experiments with shallow and deep models on four benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and MNIST demonstrate that CNN models trained with the Min-Max objective achieve remarkable performance improvements compared to the corresponding baseline models.},

abstract={In this paper, we choose to learn useful cues from object recognition mechanisms of the human visual cortex, and propose a DCNN performance improvement method without the need for increasing the network complexity. Inspired by the categoryselective property of the neuron population in the IT layer of the human visual cortex, we enforce the neuron responses at the top DCNN layer to be category selective. To achieve this, we propose the Sparse Category-Selective Objective Function (SCSOF) to modulate the neuron outputs of the top DCNN layer. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to any DCNN models. As experimental results show, when applying the proposed method to the “Quick” model and NIN models, image classiﬁcation performances are remarkably improved on four widely used benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST and SVHN, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.},

abstract={Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the ﬁrst layer they learn features similar to Gabor ﬁlters and color blobs. Such ﬁrst-layer features appear not to be speciﬁc to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to speciﬁc by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus speciﬁcity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difﬁculties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A ﬁnal surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after ﬁne-tuning to the target dataset.},

abstract={We seek to improve deep neural networks by generalizing the pooling operations that play a central role in current architectures. We pursue a careful exploration of approaches to allow pooling to learn and to adapt to complex and variable patterns. The two primary directions lie in (1) learning a pooling function via (two strategies of) combining of max and average pooling, and (2) learning a pooling function in the form of a tree-structured fusion of pooling ﬁlters that are themselves learned. In our experiments every generalized pooling operation we explore improves performance when used in place of average or max pooling. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pooling operations provide a boost in invariance properties relative to conventional pooling and set the state of the art on several widely adopted benchmark datasets; they are also easy to implement, and can be applied within various deep neural network architectures. These beneﬁts come with only a light increase in computational overhead during training and a very modest increase in the number of model parameters.},

title={Extended Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine with Multilayer Perceptron},
abstract={The Deep Learning approach provides a high performance of classiﬁcation, especially when invoking image classiﬁcation problems. However, a shortcomming of the traditional Deep Learning method is the large time scale of training. The hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) framework was based on the hierarchical learning architecture of multilayer perceptron to address the problem. H-ELM is composed of two parts; the ﬁrst entails unsupervised multilayer encoding, and the second is the supervised feature classiﬁcation. H-ELM can give a higher accuracy rate than the traditional ELM. However, there still remains room to enhance its classiﬁcation performance. This paper therefore proposes a new method termed the extending hierarchical extreme learning machine (EH-ELM), which extends the number of layers in the supervised portion of the H-ELM from a single layer to multiple layers. To evaluate the performance of the EH-ELM, the various classiﬁcation datasets were studied and compared with the H-ELM and the multilayer ELM, as well as various state-of-the-art such deep architecture methods. The experimental results show that the EH-ELM improved the accuracy rates over most other methods.},

abstract={Sample and statistically based singing synthesizers typically require a large amount of data for automatically generating expressive synthetic performances. In this paper we present a singing synthesizer that using two rather small databases is able to generate expressive synthesis from an input consisting of notes and lyrics. The system is based on unit selection and uses the Wide-Band Harmonic Sinusoidal Model for transforming samples. The ﬁrst database focuses on expression and consists of less than 2 minutes of free expressive singing using solely vowels. The second one is the timbre database which for the English case consists of roughly 35 minutes of monotonic singing of a set of sentences, one syllable per beat. The synthesis is divided in two steps. First, an expressive vowel singing performance of the target song is generated using the expression database. Next, this performance is used as input control of the synthesis using the timbre database and the target lyrics. A selection of synthetic performances have been submitted to the Interspeech Singing Synthesis Challenge 2016, in which they are compared to other competing systems.},

abstract={In this paper, a drum transcription algorithm using partially fixed non-negative matrix factorization is presented. The proposed method allows users to identify percussive events in complex mixtures with a minimal training set. The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two parts: percussive part with pre-defined drum templates and harmonic part with undefined entries. The harmonic part is able to adapt to the music content, allowing the algorithm to work in polyphonic mixtures. Drum event times can be simply picked from the percussive activation matrix with onset detection. The system is efficient and robust even with a minimal training set. The recognition rates for the ENST dataset vary from 56.7 to 78.9 /\\% for three percussive instruments extracted from polyphonic music.},

@article{2014SrivastavaDropout,
abstract={Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract={A longstanding goal in character animation is to combine data-driven specification of behavior with a system that can execute a similar behavior in a physical simulation, thus enabling realistic responses to perturbations and environmental variation. We show that well-known reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be adapted to learn robust control policies capable of imitating a broad range of example motion clips, while also learning complex recoveries, adapting to changes in morphology, and accomplishing user-specified goals. Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills. We demonstrate results using multiple characters (human, Atlas robot, bipedal dinosaur, dragon) and a large variety of skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.},

abstract={This paper introduces DeepBach, a graphical model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and speciﬁcally hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. DeepBach’s strength comes from the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the MuseScore music editor making the interaction with DeepBach easy to use.},

abstract={We present Deep Voice, a production-quality text-to-speech system constructed entirely from deep neural networks. Deep Voice lays the groundwork for truly end-to-end neural speech synthesis. The system comprises ﬁve major building blocks: a segmentation model for locating phoneme boundaries, a grapheme-tophoneme conversion model, a phoneme duration prediction model, a fundamental frequency prediction model, and an audio synthesis model. For the segmentation model, we propose a novel way of performing phoneme boundary detection with deep neural networks using connectionist temporal classiﬁcation (CTC) loss. For the audio synthesis model, we implement a variant of WaveNet that requires fewer parameters and trains faster than the original. By using a neural network for each component, our system is simpler and more ﬂexible than traditional text-tospeech systems, where each component requires laborious feature engineering and extensive domain expertise. Finally, we show that inference with our system can be performed faster than real time and describe optimized WaveNet inference kernels on both CPU and GPU that achieve up to 400x speedups over existing implementations.},

abstract={In BCI (Brain - Computer Interface) systems, brain signals must be processed to identify distinct activities that convey different mental states. We propose a new technique for the classiﬁcation of electroencephalographic (EEG) Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) activity for non-invasive BCI. The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Neural Network that includes a Fourier transform between hidden layers in order to switch from the time domain to the frequency domain analysis in the network. The ﬁrst step allows the creation of different channels. The second step is dedicated to the transformation of the signal in the frequency domain. The last step is the classiﬁcation. It uses a hybrid rejection strategy that uses a junk class for the mental transition states and thresholds for the conﬁdence values. The presented results with ofﬂine processing are obtained with 6 electrodes on 2 subjects with a time segment of 1s. The system is reliable for both subjects over 95///////\\%, with rejection criterion.},

pages={6},
abstract={Computer-based interactive music systems date back as far as the late 1960s, but increasingly accessible technologies have prompted significant growth in interest in digital musical instruments (DMIs) over the last decade. To date, the designers of DMIs have generally borrowed paradigms from acoustic instruments or the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, it can be argued that DMIs are a fundamentally different case and the suitability of these paradigms is debatable at best. For instance, DMIs lack the haptic feedback of acoustic instruments. Musical instruments are also highly specialized rather than general-purpose tools, and musical performance is not typically task-based. Additionally, Jordà notes that their designers have tended to focus on isolated parts of the problem, to the detriment of instrumental cohesion and character. While a few authors have considered DMIs as more fully rounded constructions, and the term ‘composed instruments’ has been used to describe the specification of the input-output relationship as an intentional act of composition, we argue that this is insufficient. Drawing on theories of affordances and ecological music creation, we describe an alternative model that considers DMI design as part of a broader compositional process that also includes text and hybrid acoustic-digital space. The traditionally distinct roles of designer, composer and performer are seen to blur, and the notion of composition-specific instruments is discussed. As an example of the model in practice, the interdisciplinary collaborative piece Desire Lines is described. This serves to aid an initial assessment of the model and its implementation, and informs some remarks around its limitations and future possibilities.},

abstract={Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classiﬁcation: reaching 4.9///////\\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8///////\\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract={Automatic drum transcription (ADT) systems attempt to generate a symbolic music notation for percussive in-struments in audio recordings. Neural networks have al-ready been shown to perform well in fields related to ADT such as source separation and onset detection due to their utilisation of time-series data in classification. We pro-pose the use of neural networks for ADT in order to ex-ploit their ability to capture a complex configuration of fea-tures associated with individual or combined drum classes. In this paper we present a bi-directional recurrent neu-ral network for offline detection of percussive onsets from specified drum classes and a recurrent neural network suit-able for online operation. In both systems, a separate net-work is trained to identify onsets for each drum class under observation—that is, kick drum, snare drum, hi-hats, and combinations thereof. We perform four evaluations utilis-ing the IDMT-SMT-Drums and ENST minus one datasets, which cover solo percussion and polyphonic audio respec-tively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-sented methods for solo percussion and a capacity for iden-tifying snare drums, which are historically the most diffi-cult drum class to detect.},

abstract={We present an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) approach to predict stock market indices, particularly with respect to the forecast of their trend movements up or down. Exploiting different Neural Networks architectures, we provide numerical analysis of concrete ﬁnancial time series. In particular, after a brief re´sume´ of the existing literature on the subject, we consider the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks techniques. We focus on the importance of choosing the correct input features, along with their preprocessing, for the speciﬁc learning algorithm one wants to use. Eventually, we consider the S///////\\&P500 historical time series, predicting trend on the basis of data from the past days, and proposing a novel approach based on combination of wavelets and CNN, which outperforms the basic neural networks ones. We show, that neural networks are able to predict ﬁnancial time series movements even trained only on plain time series data and propose more ways to improve results.},

abstract={Regularizing neural networks is an important task to reduce overﬁtting. Dropout [1] has been a widely-used regularization trick for neural networks. In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), dropout is usually applied to the fully connected layers. Meanwhile, the regularization eﬀect of dropout in the convolutional layers has not been thoroughly analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we analyze the eﬀect of dropout in the convolutional layers, which is indeed proved as a powerful generalization method. We observed that dropout in CNNs regularizes the networks by adding noise to the output feature maps of each layer, yielding robustness to variations of images. Based on this observation, we propose a stochastic dropout whose drop ratio varies for each iteration. Furthermore, we propose a new regularization method which is inspired by behaviors of image ﬁlters. Rather than randomly drop the activation, we selectively drop the activations which have high values across the feature map or across the channels. Experimental results validate the regularization performance of selective max-drop and stochastic dropout is competitive to the dropout or spatial dropout [2].},

The contents of both the input layer and the set of training data have been optimized through genetic search in order to maximize the accuracy of the network. The output of the network is im- proved upon with a local heuristic hill-climber (HC). We implement this model in an existing system for generating guitar arrangements via genetic algorithm (GA). When compared to the original system for generating tablature, we note modest improvement in tablature quality and drastic improvements in execution time.},

author={He, Lei and Dellwo, Volker},
abstract={A speech signal can be viewed as a high frequency carrier signal containing the temporal fine structure (TFS) that is modulated by a low frequency envelope (ENV). A widely used method to decompose a speech signal into the TFS and ENV is the Hilbert transform. Although this method has been available for about one century and is widely applied in various kinds of speech processing tasks (e.g. speech chimeras), there are only very few speech processing packages that contain readily available functions for the Hilbert transform, and there is very little textbook type literature tailored for speech scientists to explain the processes behind the transform. With this paper we provide the code for carrying out the Hilbert operation to obtain the TFS and ENV in the widely used speech processing software Praat, and explain the basics of the procedure. To verify our code, we compare the Hilbert transform in Praat with a widely applied function for the same purpose in MATLAB (“hilbert(...)”). We can confirm that both methods arrive at identical outputs.},

abstract={This paper investigates how to blindly evaluate the visual quality of an image by learning rules from linguistic descriptions. Extensive psychological evidence shows that humans prefer to conduct evaluations qualitatively rather than numerically. The qualitative evaluations are then converted into the numerical scores to fairly benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. Recently, lots of learning-based IQA models are proposed by analyzing the mapping from the images to numerical ratings. However, the learnt mapping can hardly be accurate enough because some information has been lost in such an irreversible conversion from the linguistic descriptions to numerical scores. In this paper, we propose a blind IQA model, which learns qualitative evaluations directly and outputs numerical scores for general utilization and fair comparison. Images are represented by natural scene statistics features. A discriminative deep model is trained to classify the features into ﬁve grades, corresponding to ﬁve explicit mental concepts, i.e., excellent, good, fair, poor, and bad. A newly designed quality pooling is then applied to convert the qualitative labels into scores. The classiﬁcation framework is not only much more natural than the regression-based models, but also robust to the small sample size problem. Thorough experiments are conducted on popular databases to verify the model’s effectiveness, efﬁciency, and robustness.},

abstract={This paper presents the Deep Convolution Inverse Graphics Network (DC-IGN), a model that learns an interpretable representation of images. This representation is disentangled with respect to transformations such as out-of-plane rotations and lighting variations. The DC-IGN model is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators and is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm. We propose a training procedure to encourage neurons in the graphics code layer to represent a specific transformation (e.g. pose or light). Given a single input image, our model can generate new images of the same object with variations in pose and lighting. We present qualitative and quantitative results of the model's efficacy at learning a 3D rendering engine.},

The model consists of start, attack, sustain, release, and end segments with variable split-point amplitude and time. The estimation of the times is done using smoothed derivatives of the envelopes. The estimated split-point values can be used together with a curve-form model introduced in this paper in the analysis/synthesis of musical sounds. The envelope model can recreate noise-less musical sounds with good fidelity, and the method for the estimation of the envelope times performs significantly better than the classical percentage- based method.},

Furthermore, we evaluated the performances of the architectures with varying the number of layers on a larger dataset (Million Song Dataset), and found that deeper models outperformed the 4-layer architecture. The experiments show that mel-spectrogram is an effective time-frequency representation for automatic tagging and that more complex models benefit from more training data.},

abstract={Given a directed graph G, a feedback arc set of G is a subset of its edges containing at least one edge of every cycle in G. Finding a feedback arc set of minimum cardinality is the minimum feedback arc set problem. The present paper focuses on large and sparse graphs. The minimum set cover formulation of the minimum feedback arc set problem is practical as long as all the simple cycles in G can be enumerated. Unfortunately, even sparse graphs can have Ω(2n) simple cycles, and such graphs appear in practice. An exact method is proposed that enumerates simple cycles in a lazy fashion, and extends an incomplete cycle matrix iteratively in the hope that only a tractable number of cycles has to be enumerated until a minimum feedback arc set is found. Numerical results are given on a test set containing large and sparse test graphs relevant for industrial applications.},

The design of the Gaussian ﬁlter bears relationship with the noise statistics and also some basic information about the signal.

abstract={Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has remained a challenging and interesting problem. Despite efforts made in developing various methods for FER, existing approaches traditionally lack generalizability when applied to unseen images or those that are captured in wild setting. Most of the existing approaches are based on engineered features (e.g. HOG, LBPH, and Gabor) where the classiﬁer’s hyperparameters are tuned to give best recognition accuracies across a single database, or a small collection of similar databases. Nevertheless, the results are not signiﬁcant when they are applied to novel data. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture to address the FER problem across multiple well-known standard face datasets. Speciﬁcally, our network consists of two convolutional layers each followed by max pooling and then four Inception layers. The network is a single component architecture that takes registered facial images as the input and classiﬁes them into either of the six basic or the neutral expressions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on seven publically available facial expression databases, viz. MultiPIE, MMI, CK+, DISFA, FERA, SFEW, and FER2013. The results of proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods and better than traditional convolutional neural networks and in both accuracy and training time.},

title={Musical Audio Synthesis Using Autoencoding Neural Nets},
date={2014},
abstract={With an optimal network topology and tuning of hyperpa-rameters, artificial neural networks (ANNs) may be trained to learn a mapping from low level audio features to one or more higher-level representations. Such artificial neu-ral networks are commonly used in classification and re-gression settings to perform arbitrary tasks. In this work we suggest repurposing autoencoding neural networks as musical audio synthesizers. We offer an interactive musi-cal audio synthesis system that uses feedforward artificial neural networks for musical audio synthesis, rather than discriminative or regression tasks. In our system an ANN is trained on frames of low-level features. A high level representation of the musical audio is learned though an autoencoding neural net. Our real-time synthesis system allows one to interact directly with the parameters of the model and generate musical audio in real time. This work therefore proposes the exploitation of neural networks for creative musical applications.},

Recurrent neural networks have been successful in capturing long-range dependencies in a number of problems but only recently have found their way into generative image models. We here introduce a recurrent image model based on multi-dimensional long short-term memory units which are particularly suited for image modeling due to their spatial structure. Our model scales to images of arbitrary size and its likelihood is computationally tractable. We find that it outperforms the state of the art in quantitative comparisons on several image datasets and produces promising results when used for texture synthesis and inpainting.},

abstract={In this work we propose a novel interpretation of residual networks showing that they can be seen as a collection of many paths of differing length. Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.},

abstract={Realistic image manipulation is challenging because it requires modifying the image appearance in a user-controlled way, while preserving the realism of the result. Unless the user has considerable artistic skill, it is easy to "fall off" the manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we propose to learn the natural image manifold directly from data using a generative adversarial neural network. We then define a class of image editing operations, and constrain their output to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The model automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic as possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of constrained optimization and are applied in near-real time. We evaluate our algorithm on the task of realistic photo manipulation of shape and color. The presented method can further be used for changing one image to look like the other, as well as generating novel imagery from scratch based on user's scribbles.},

We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two-dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset.

abstract={We present a novel technique to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines both global priors and local image features. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks, our deep network fea- tures a fusion layer that allows us to elegantly merge local information dependent on small image patches with global priors computed using the entire image. The entire framework, including the global and local priors as well as the colorization model, is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene classification data-base to train our model, exploiting the class labels of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the global priors. We validate our approach with a user study and compare against the state of the art, where we show significant improvements. Further- more, we demonstrate our method extensively on many different types of images, including black-and-white photography from over a hundred years ago, and show realistic colorizations.},

abstract={The Recurrent Neural Networks and their vari-ants have shown promising performances in se-quence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extrac-tors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by fac-torizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained si-multaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using mul-tiple real-world video datasets and achieve com-petitive performances with state-of-the-art mod-els, even though our model architecture is or-ders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential data with RNN architec-tures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional sequential data.},

abstract={Recently, there have been several promising methods to generate realistic imagery from deep convolutional networks. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to 'scribble' over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach can generate more realistic, more diverse, and more controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.},

@article{2008AagerfalkOutsourcing,
booktitle={MIS Quarterly},
pmid={31831011},
abstract={This paper presents a psychological contract perspective on the use of the open source development model as a global sourcing strategy-opensourcing, as we term it here-whereby commerical companies and open source communities collaborate on development of software of commercial interest to the company. Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product. We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness: The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises. It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.},

Automatic parameter estimation procedures have been developed in the past for some speciﬁc parameters or application scenarios but, up to now, no approach has been proved applicable to a wide variety of use cases. A general solution to parameters estimation problem is provided along this paper which is based on a supervised convolutional machine learning paradigm. The described approach can be classiﬁed as “end-to-end” and requires, thus, no speciﬁc knowledge of the model itself. Furthermore, parameters are learned from data generated by the model, requiring no effort in the preparation and labeling of the training dataset. To provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the performance, this method is applied to a patented digital waveguide pipe organ model, yielding very promising results.},

abstract={The brain processes information through many layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful1,2,3,4, but it complicates learning by making it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made1,5. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm1 assigns blame to a neuron by computing exactly how it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies error signals by matrices consisting of all the synaptic weights on the neuron’s axon and farther downstream. This operation requires a precisely choreographed transport of synaptic weight information, which is thought to be impossible in the brain 1,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we present a surprisingly simple algorithm for deep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by random synaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful information from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In essence, the network learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism performs as quickly and accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems and describe the principles which underlie its function. Our demonstration provides a plausible basis for how a neuron can be adapted using error signals generated at distal locations in the brain, and thus dispels long-held assumptions about the algorithmic constraints on learning in neural circuits.},

abstract={We present a new model for singing synthesis based on a modiﬁed version of the WaveNet architecture. Instead of modeling raw waveform, we model features produced by a parametric vocoder that separates the inﬂuence of pitch and timbre. This allows conveniently modifying pitch to match any target melody, facilitates training on more modest dataset sizes, and signiﬁcantly reduces training and generation times. Our model makes frame-wise predictions using mixture density outputs rather than categorical outputs in order to reduce the required parameter count. As we found overﬁtting to be an issue with the relatively small datasets used in our experiments, we propose a method to regularize the model and make the autoregressive generation process more robust to prediction errors. Using a simple multi-stream architecture, harmonic, aperiodic and voiced/unvoiced components can all be predicted in a coherent manner. We compare our method to existing parametric statistical and state-of-the-art concatenative methods using quantitative metrics and a listening test. While naive implementations of the autoregressive generation algorithm tend to be inefﬁcient, using a smart algorithm we can greatly speed up the process and obtain a system that’s competitive in both speed and quality.},

abstract={This paper reviews the literature on the problem of information overload, with particular reference to business organisations. The literature reveals that although the problem of information overload has existed for many years, in recent years the problem has become more widely recognised and experienced. Both perceptions and the actual effects of information overload have been exacerbated by the rapid advances made in information and communication technology, although it is not clear cut as to whether the Internet has worsened or improved the situation. A theme stressed in the literature is the paradoxical situation that, although there is an abundance of information available, it is often difficult to obtain useful, relevant information when it is needed. Some solutions put forward to reduce information overload are: a reduction in the duplication of information found in the professional literature; the adoption of personal information management strategies, together with the integration of software solutions such as push technology and intelligent agents; and the provision of value-added information (filtered by software or information specialists). An emphasis is placed on technology as a tool and not the driver, while increased information literacy may provide the key to reducing information overload.},

The tuned ﬁlter characteristics of MWDFT is modiﬁed into more ﬂat characteristic around the center frequency with negative feedback, which increases the bandwidth of the ﬁlter. An adaptive sampling pulse adjustment mechanism is incorporated in the proposed structure for online estimation of frequency. Hence, the frequency error was exploited to achieve synchronization between in-phase component of MWDFT and input signal of estimation. The amplitude is estimated in online from the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of MWDFT. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the existing techniques and experimentally validated on single-link ﬂexible manipulator system for the online estimation of frequency and amplitude of tip deﬂection signal. The experimental investigation prove that the proposed online technique performs well over the existing techniques.},

abstract={It is known that the learning rate is the most important hyper-parameter to tune for training deep neural networks. This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally ﬁnd the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of ﬁxed values achieves improved classiﬁcation accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate “reasonable bounds” – linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

abstract={For the analysis of rotational damping measurements in the time domain, two different identiﬁcation procedures are compared. The ﬁrst procedure investigated incorporates a Hilbert transform of the data, which enables an analysis by a linear regression calculation. The second approach is a direct nonlinear regression calculation of a damped sine function. The two approaches are compared using both simulated data and measurement data. The results of the comparison are presented.},

abstract={Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.},

In this work, we present a system that performs emotion recognition on video data using both CNNs and RNNs, and we also analyze how much each neural network component contributes to the system's overall performance. We present our findings on videos from the Audio/Visual+Emotion Challenge (AV+EC2015).

abstract={We present a novel neural network for processing sequences. The ByteNet is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efﬁcient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive ﬁeld. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We ﬁnd that the latent alignment structure contained in the representations reﬂects the expected alignment between the tokens.},

abstract={Background: Appropriate definition of neural network architecture prior to data analysis is crucial for successful data mining. This can be challenging when the underlying model of the data is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimizing neural network architecture using genetic programming as a machine learning strategy would improve the ability of neural networks to model and detect nonlinear interactions among genes in studies of common human diseases. Results: Using simulated data, we show that a genetic programming optimized neural network approach is able to model gene-gene interactions as well as a traditional back propagation neural network. Furthermore, the genetic programming optimized neural network is better than the traditional back propagation neural network approach in terms of predictive ability and power to detect gene-gene interactions when non-functional polymorphisms are present. Conclusion: This study suggests that a machine learning strategy for optimizing neural network architecture may be preferable to traditional trial-and-error approaches for the identification and characterization of gene-gene interactions in common, complex human diseases.},

Emerging work with rectified linear (ReL) hidden units demonstrates additional gains in final system performance relative to more commonly used sigmoidal nonlinearities. In this work, we explore the use of deep rectifier networks as acoustic models for the 300 hour Switchboard conversational speech recognition task. Using simple training procedures without pretraining, networks with rectifier nonlinearities produce 2 /\% absolute reductions in word error rates over their sigmoidal counterparts. We analyze hidden layer representations to quantify differences in how ReL units encode inputs as compared to sigmoidal units. Finally, we evaluate a variant of the ReL unit with a gradient more amenable to optimization in an attempt to further improve deep rectifier networks.},

Sounds generated by the model were subject to objective measurements against real-world recordings, which showed that many of the physical properties of the harp were replicated in our model, but a possible link between harmonics and vibration amplitude was not. A perceptual test was performed, where participants were asked to rate sounds in terms of how plausible they were in comparison with spectral modelling synthesis and recorded Aeolian Harp samples. Evaluation showed that our model performed as well as an alternative non-physical synthesis method, but was not as authentic as actual recorded samples.},

abstract={The acoustic response of the vocal tract is fundamental to our interpretation of voice production. As an acoustic filter, it shapes the spectral envelope of vocal fold vibration towards resonant modes, or formants, whose behaviours form the most basic building blocks of phonetics. Physical models of the voice exploit this effect by modelling the nature of wave propagation in abstracted cylindrical constructs. Whilst effective, the accuracy of such approaches is limited due to their limited geometrical analogue. Developments in numerical acoustics modelling meanwhile have seen the formalisation of higher dimensionality configurations of the same technologies, allowing a much closer geometrical representation of an acoustic field. The major focus of this thesis is the application of such a technique to the vocal tract, and comparison of its performance with lower dimensionality approaches. To afford the development of such models, a body of data is collected from Magnetic Resonance Imaging for a range of subjects, and procedures are developed for the decomposition of this imaging into suitable, efficient data structures for simulation. The simulation technique is exhaustively validated using a combination of bespoke measurement/inversion techniques and analytical determination of lower frequency behaviours. Finally, voice synthesis based on each numerical model is compared with acoustic recordings of the subjects involved and with equivalent simulations from lower dimensionality methods. It is found that application of a higher dimensionality method typically yields a more accurate frequency-domain representation of the voice, although in some cases lower dimensionality equivalents are seen to perform better at low frequencies.},

One of the concerns for applying them to text-to-speech applications is its effect on latency. To address this concern, this paper proposes a low-latency, streaming speech synthesis architecture using unidirectional LSTMRNNs with a recurrent output layer. The use of unidirectional RNN architecture allows frame-synchronous streaming inference of output acoustic features given input linguistic features. The recurrent output layer further encourages smooth transition between acoustic features at consecutive frames. Experimental results in subjective listening tests show that the proposed architecture can synthesize natural sounding speech without requiring utterance-level batch processing.},

abstract={Generative models in vision have seen rapid progress due to algorithmic improvements and the availability of high-quality image datasets. In this paper, we offer contributions in both these areas to enable similar progress in audio modeling. First, we detail a powerful new WaveNet-style autoencoder model that conditions an autoregressive decoder on temporal codes learned from the raw audio waveform. Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that the model learns a manifold of embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments, meaningfully interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic and expressive.},

abstract={\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Two main approaches are currently prevalent in the digital emulation of musical instruments: manipulation of pre-recorded samples and techniques of real-time synthesis, generally based on physical models with varying degrees of accuracy. Concerning the first, while the processing power of present-day computers enables their use in real-time, many restrictions arising from this sample-based design persist; the huge on disk space requirements and the stiffness of musical articulations being the most prominent. On the other side of the spectrum, pure synthesis approaches, while offering greater flexibility, fail to capture and reproduce certain nuances central to the verisimilitude of the generated sound, offering a dry, synthetic output, at a high computational cost. We propose a method where ensembles of lightweight neural networks working in parallel are learned, from crafted frequency-domain features of an instrument sound spectra, an arbitrary instrument's voice and articulations realistically and efficiently. We find that our method, while retaining perceptual sound quality on par with sampled approaches, exhibits 1/10 of latency times of industry standard real-time synthesis algorithms, and 1/100 of the disk space requirements of industry standard sample-based digital musical instruments. This method can, therefore, serve as a basis for more efficient implementations in dedicated devices, such as keyboards and electronic drumkits and in general purpose platforms, like desktops and tablets or open-source hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From a conceptual point of view, this work highlights the advantages of a closer integration of machine learning with other subjects, especially in the endeavor of new product development. Exploiting the synergy between neural networks, digital signal processing techniques and physical modelling, we illustrate the proposed method via the implementation of two virtual instruments: a conventional grand piano and a hibrid stringed instrument.},

abstract={Context. AGILE is an Italian Space Agency mission dedicated to observingthe gamma-ray Universe. The AGILE's very innovative instrumentation forthe first time combines a gamma-ray imager (sensitive in the energyrange 30 MeV-50 GeV), a hard X-ray imager (sensitive in the range 18-60keV), a calorimeter (sensitive in the range 350 keV-100 MeV), and ananticoincidence system. AGILE was successfully launched on 2007 April 23from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorialorbit with very low particle background.Aims. AGILE provides crucial data for the study of active galacticnuclei, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, unidentified gamma-ray sources,galactic compact objects, supernova remnants, TeV sources, andfundamental physics by microsecond timing.Methods. An optimal sky angular positioning (reaching 0.1 degrees ingamma- rays and 1-2 arcmin in hard X-rays) and very large fields of view(2.5 sr and 1 sr, respectively) are obtained by the use of Silicondetectors integrated in a very compact instrument.Results. AGILE surveyed the gamma- ray sky and detected many Galacticand extragalactic sources during the first months of observations.Particular emphasis is given to multifrequency observation programs ofextragalactic and galactic objects.Conclusions. AGILE is a successful high-energy gamma-ray mission thatreached its nominal scientific performance. The AGILE Cycle-1 pointingprogram started on 2007 December 1, and is open to the internationalcommunity through a Guest Observer Program.},

abstract={Feature recognition, from low level geometric entities of product designrepresentations within a CAD model to facilitate process planning andmanufacturing activities, has been of significant importance in computerintegrated manufacturing (CIM). However, the emerging paradigm of AgileManufacturing has imposed additional requirements of `'neutralformat{\{}''{\}} so that form-feature information can be readily shared amongmultiple partners of a virtual enterprise. Recently, the STandard forthe Exchange of Product model data (STEP) has emerged as the means forneutral form exchange of product related data. The ``STEP efforts{\{}''{\}}have broken down the domain of manufacturing related activities in theform of application protocols (APs) target for specific functions whichinclude drafting, configuration control and feature-based processplanning to mention a few. Efforts are still on to increase theacceptance and use of this international standard (IS). This paperfocuses on our efforts to support the STEP standard with the developmentof a standards-oriented form-feature extraction system. The developedfeature extraction system takes as a input a STEP file defining thegeometry and topology of a part and generates as output a STEP file withform-feature information in AP224 format for form feature-based processplanning. The system can also be interfaced with a recent IGES to AP202translator {\{}[{\}}M.P. Bhandarkar, B. Downie, M. Hardwick, R.

abstract={This paper considers a supply chain design problem for a new marketopportunity with uncertain demand in an agile manufacturing setting. Weconsider the integrated optimization of logistics and production costsassociated with the supply chain members. These problems routinely occurin a wide variety of industries including semiconductor manufacturing,multi-tier automotive supply chains, and consumer appliances to name afew. There are two types of decision variables: binary variables forselection of companies to form the supply chain and continuous variablesassociated with production planning. A scenario approach is used tohandle the uncertainty of demand. The formulation is a robustoptimization model with three components in the objective function:expected total costs, cost variability due to demand uncertainty, andexpected penalty for demand unmet at the end of the planning horizon.The increase of computational time with the numbers of echelons andmembers per echelon necessitates a heuristic. A heuristic based on ak-shortest path algorithm is developed by using a surrogate distance todenote the effectiveness of each member in the supply chain. Theheuristic can find an optimal solution very quickly in some small- andmedium-size cases. For large problems, a ``good{\{}''{\}} solution with asmall gap relative to our lower bound is obtained in a shortcomputational time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

More recently, the agilemanufacturing paradigm has been highlighted as an alternative to, andpossibly an improvement on, leanness. In pursuing such arguments inisolation, the power of each paradigm may be lost, which is basicallythat agile manufacturing is adopted where demand is volatile, and leanmanufacturing adopted where there is a stable demand. However, in somesituations it is advisable to utilize a different paradigm on eitherside of the material flow de-coupling point to enable a total supplychain strategy.

Since the CGRO operation in 1991-2000, one of the primaryunresolved questions about the blazar gamma-ray emission has been itspossible correlation with the low-energy (in particular optical)emission. To help answer this problem, the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope(WEBT) consortium has organized the GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP)to provide the optical-to-radio monitoring data to be compared with thegamma-ray detections by the AGILE and GLAST satellites. This new WEBTproject started in early September 2007, just before a strong gamma-raydetection of 0716+714 by AGILE.Methods. We present the GASP-WEBT optical and radio light curves of thisblazar obtained in July-November 2007, about various AGILE pointings atthe source. We construct NIR-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs),by assembling GASP-WEBT data together with UV data from the Swift ToOobservations of late October.Results. We observe a contemporaneous optical-radio outburst, which is arare and interesting phenomenon in blazars. The shape of the SEDs duringthe outburst appears peculiarly wavy because of an optical excess and aUV drop- and-rise. The optical light curve is well sampled during theAGILE pointings, showing prominent and sharp flares. A futurecross-correlation analysis of the optical and AGILE data will shed lighton the expected relationship between these flares and the gamma-rayevents.},

Existing literature, however, mainlypresents agility as a general management or a strongly manufacturingbiased concept, but does not explicitly relate the concept to the supplychain as a whole. Research also shows a bias towards the USA. This paperpresents an attempt to establish an audit of agility in the supplychain. The audit is used in an empirical investigation of agilecapabilities in Europe. Using existing streams of supply chain researchas building blocks, a preliminary framework is introduced for creatingan agile supply chain.

Metamaterialdevices based on these effects include gradient-index lenses(11,12),modulators for terahertz radiation(13-15) and compact waveguides(16).The resonant nature of metamaterials results in frequency dispersion andnarrow bandwidth operation where the centre frequency is fixed by thegeometry and dimensions of the elements comprising the metamaterialcomposite. The creation of frequency-agile metamaterials would extendthe spectral range over which devices function and, further, enable themanufacture of new devices such as dynamically tunable notch filters.Here, we demonstrate such frequency-agile metamaterials operating in thefar-infrared by incorporating semiconductors in critical regions ofmetallic split-ring resonators. For this first-generation device,external optical control results in tuning of the metamaterial resonancefrequency by similar to 20{\%}. Our approach is integrable with currentsemiconductor technologies and can be implemented in other regions ofthe electromagnetic spectrum.},

abstract={About a decade ago, the agile manufacturing paradigm was formulated inresponse to the constantly changing `new economy' and as a basis forreturning to global competitiveness. While agility means differentthings to different enterprises under different contexts, the followingelements capture its essential concept: agility is characterized bycooperativeness and synergism (possibly resulting in virtualcorporations), by a strategic vision that enables thriving in face ofcontinuous and unpredictable change, by the responsive creation anddelivery of customer-valued, high quality and mass customizedgoods/services, by nimble organization structures of a knowledgeable andempowered workforce, and facilitated by an information infrastructurethat links constituent partners in a unified electronic network. Duringthis period, a significant amount of attention from both the academicand industrial communities has produced a large body of results inresearch and development related to this topic. Each contribution hastackled a different aspect of this large field. In this paper, we reviewa wide range of recent literature on agile manufacturing. About 73papers from premier scientific journals and conferences have beenreviewed, and a classification scheme to organize these is proposed. Wecritique these bodies of work and suggest directions for additionalresearch and identify topics where fruitful opportunities exist.},

The core theme of this paper is that, in spite ofthe increasing attention given to manufacturing strategy from theseminal work of Skinner through to the plethora of articles in recenttimes, little is mentioned about its application to paradigms of agilityor mass customisation. As a consequence firms attempt to become agileand to pursue mass customisation without appreciating the contributionof plant-specific manufacturing strategies that might enable them toachieve these aspirations. We examine the enablers and strategicblockages in pursuing mass customisation, via a mapping process, andreveal reasons why some firms remain unable to devise and implementmanufacturing strategies.},

Manufacturing/serviceprocesses based on AM are characterized by customer-supplier integratedprocesses for product design, manufacturing, marketing, and supportservices. Agile manufacturing requires enriching of the customer;cooperating with competitors; organizing to manage change, uncertaintyand complexity; and leveraging people and information. In recent years,a number of research papers have been published in the area of AM. Theterm `agile' was coined in 1991. However, there are still some seriousconcerns that prevent companies from taking an entirely differentdirection from AM. Considering the potential importance of agilemanufacturing in 21st century manufacturing competitiveness, an attempthas been made in this paper to re-examine the scope, definitions andstrategies of AM. In addition, a framework has been presented as a basisfor understanding the major strategies and relevant technologies of AM.},

Using two actuated legs with rotary motion andtwo passive revolute joints at each foot, this robot can climb and steerin any orientation. Due to its compact design, a high degree ofminiaturization is possible. It has onboard power, computing, andwireless communication, which allow for semiautonomous operation.Various aspects of a functioning prototype design and performance arediscussed in detail, including leg and foot design and gait dynamics. Amodel for the adhesion requirements and performance is developed andverified through experiments. Using an adhesive elastomer (Vytaflex 10),the current prototype can climb 90 slopes at a speed of up to 6 cm/s andsteer to any angle reliably on a,smooth acrylic surface as well astransition from floor walking to wall climbing.

abstract={In this paper, we draw on control theory to understand the conditionsunder which the use of agile practices is most effective in improvingsoftware project quality. Although agile development methodologies offerthe potential of improving software development outcomes, limitedresearch has examined how project managers can structure the softwaredevelopment environment to maximize the benefits of agile methodologyuse during a project. As a result, project managers have little guidanceon how to manage teams who are using agile methodologies. Arguing thatthe most effective control modes are those that provide teams withautonomy in determining the methods for achieving project objectives, wepropose hypotheses related to the interaction between control modes,agile methodology use, and requirements change. We test the model in afield study of 862 software developers in 110 teams. The model explainssubstantial variance in four objective measures of project quality-bugseverity, component complexity, coordinative complexity, and dynamiccomplexity. Results largely support our hypotheses, highlighting theinterplay between project control, agile methodology use, andrequirements change. The findings contribute to extant literature byintegrating control theory into the growing literature on agilemethodology use and by identifying specific contingencies affecting theefficacy of different control modes. We discuss the theoretical andpractical implications of our results.},

The 1.56-mumpulses are converted to supercontinuum (1.1-2.2 mum) pulses by thenon-linear fiber, and these broadband pulses are stretched and arrangedinto wavelength scans by the dispersive fiber. The tunable bandpassfilter is used to select a portion of the super-continuum as ascan-wavelength output. A variety of scan characteristics are possibleusing this approach. As an example, an output with an effectivelinewidth of approximately 1 cm(-1) is scanned from 1350-1550 nm every20 us.

The comparative analysis is performed using the method'slife-cycle coverage, project management support, type of practicalguidance, fitness-for-use and empirical evidence as the analyticallenses. The results show that agile software development methods,without rationalization, cover certain/different phases of the softwaredevelopment life-cycle and most of them do not offer adequate supportfor project management. Yet, many methods still attempt to strive foruniversal solutions (as opposed to situation appropriate) and theempirical evidence is still very limited.

abstract={The business environment is one which is ever more demanding oncompanies, due to its sheer dynamism, which means that they areconstantly having to improve their manufacturing performance.Organisations are continuously having to cope with changing markets thatare unpredictable and more diversified, increasing global competitionand ever changing customer demands. Companies now have to be able to notonly predict variations and changes within the market and socio-economicand political environments but must also be able to adapt and change inaccordance with these environments. As a result, this demands that anorganisation develops and sustains an inherent ability to continuouslychange. Such a demand can be met by adopting the management philosophyof agile manufacturing. Tn embracing such an approach, there are a lotof key concepts and enabling technologies that are required to be ableto implement agile manufacturing and many companies do not know how fardown the path they are towards becoming agile manufacturingorganisations. Hence, in providing a deeper understanding, this paperproposes a conceptual model, based on joint research, which has beendeveloped to identify where UK's best practice companies are in theirquest to become agile manufacturing organisations. In support of this, aquestionnaire has been developed and completed by best practitioners ofmanufacturing, to assess the model, and establish whether they aremaking progress to becoming agile manufacturing organisations.

abstract={Changing customer and technological requirements force manufacturers todevelop agile supply chain capabilities in order to be competitive.Therefore, several companies are stressing flexibility and agility inorder to respond, real time, to the unique needs of customers andmarkets. However, the resource competencies required are often difficultto mobilise and retain by single companies. It is therefore imperativefor companies to co-operate and leverage complementary competencies. Tothis end, legally separate and spatially distributed companies arebecoming integrated through Internet-based technologies. The paperreviews emerging patterns in supply chain integration. It also exploresthe relationship between the emerging patterns and attainment ofcompetitive objectives. The results reported in the paper are based onthe data collected from a survey using the standard questionnaire. Thesurvey involved 600 companies in the UK, as part of a larger study ofagile manufacturing. The study was driven by a conceptual model, whichrelates supply chain practices to competitive objectives. The studyinvolves the use of factor analysis to reduce research variables to afew principal components. Subsequently, multiple regression wasconducted to study the relationship amongst the selected variables. Theresults validate the proposed conceptual model and lend credence tocurrent thinking that supply chain integration is a vital tool forcompetitive advantage. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Empirical validation of software metrics suites to predict faultproneness in object-oriented (OO) components is essential to ensuretheir practical use in industrial settings. In this paper, weempirically validate three OO metrics suites for their ability topredict software quality in terms of fault-proneness: the Chidamber andKemerer (CK) metrics, Abreu's Metrics for Object-Oriented Design (MOOD), and Bansiya and Davis' Quality Metrics for Object-Oriented Design(QMOOD). Some CK class metrics have previously been shown to be goodpredictors of initial OO software quality. However, the other two suiteshave not been heavily validated except by their original proposers.Here, we explore the ability of these three metrics suites to predictfault-prone classes using defect data for six versions of Rhino, anopen-source implementation of JavaScript written in Java. We concludethat the CK and QMOOD suites contain similar components and producestatistical models that are effective in detecting error-prone classes.We also conclude that the class components in the MOOD metrics suite arenot good class fault-proneness predictors. Analyzing multivariate binarylogistic regression models across six Rhino versions indicates thesemodels may be useful in assessing quality in OO classes produced usingmodern highly iterative or agile software development processes.},

abstract={Planning the path of an autonomous, agile vehicle in a dynamicenvironment is a very complex problem, especially when the vehicle isrequired to use its full maneuvering capabilities. Recent efforts aimedat using randomized algorithms for planning the path of kinematic anddynamic vehicles have demonstrated considerable potential forimplementation on future autonomous platforms. This paper builds uponthese efforts by proposing a randomized path planning architecture fordynamical systems in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles. Thisarchitecture addresses the dynamic constraints on the vehicle's motion,and it provides at the same time a consistent decoupling betweenlow-level control and motion planning. The path planning algorithmretains the convergence properties of its kinematic counterparts. Systemsafety is also addressed in the face of finite computation times byanalyzing the behavior of the algorithm when the available onboardcomputation resources are limited, and the planning must be performed inreal time. The proposed algorithm can be applied to vehicles whosedynamics are described either by ordinary differential equations or byhigher-level, hybrid representations. Simulation examples involving aground robot and a small autonomous helicopter are presented anddiscussed.},

The agilityis attributed to a proposed frequency comparison technique which isbased on measuring the period difference between two signals. Othermixed-signal circuits are also developed to facilitate this approach.The PLL incorporating the proposed calibration technique is implementedin a 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The measured PLL phase noise at 10 GHz is-102 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset frequency and the reference spurs are lowerthan -48 dBc. The PLL consumes 44 mW in the low-current mode.

It is planned to be operational in the years2003-2006, a period in which no other gamma-ray mission in the sameenergy range is foreseen.AGILE is made of a silicon tungsten tracker, a CsI(Tl) minicalorimeter(1.5X(0)), an anticoincidence system of segmented plastic scintillatorsand a X-ray imaging detector sensitive in the 10-40 keV range. Thetracker consists of 14 planes, each of them made of two layers of 16single-sided, AC coupled, 410 mum thick, 9.5 x 9.5 cm(2) silicondetectors with a readout pitch of 242 mum and a floating strip.

We generate, without mode-locked lasers,two frequency combs of slightly different repetition frequencies andmoderate, but rapidly tunable, spectral span. The output of afrequency-agile continuous-wave laser is split and sent into twoelectro-optic intensity modulators. Flat-top low-noise frequency combsare produced by wave-breaking in a nonlinear optical fibre of normaldispersion. With a dual-comb spectrometer, we record Doppler-limitedspectra spanning 60 GHz within 13 mu s and an 80 kHz refresh rate, at atuning speed of 10 nm s(-1). The sensitivity for weak absorption isenhanced by a long gas-filled hollow-core fibre. New opportunities forreal-time diagnostics may be opened up, even outside the laboratory.},

abstract={Agile software development practices such as eXtreme Programming (XP)and SCRUM have increasingly been adopted to respond to the challenges ofvolatile business environments, where the markets and technologiesevolve rapidly and present the unexpected. In spite of the encouragingresults so far, little is known about how agile practices affectcommunication. This article presents the results from a study whichexamined the impact of XP and SCRUM practices on communication withinsoftware development teams and within the focal organization. Theresearch was carried out as a case study in F-Secure where two agilesoftware development projects were compared from the communicationperspective. The goal of the study is to increase the understanding ofcommunication in the context of agile software development: internallyamong the developers and project leaders and in the interface betweenthe development team and stakeholders (i.e. customers, testers, otherdevelopment teams). The study shows that agile practices improve bothinformal and formal communication. However, it further indicates that,in larger development situations involving multiple externalstakeholders, a mismatch of adequate communication mechanisms cansometimes even hinder the communication. The study highlights the factthat hurdles and improvements in the communication process can bothaffect the feature requirements and task subtask dependencies asdescribed in coordination theory. While the use of SCRUM and some XPpractices facilitate team and organizational communication of thedependencies between product features and working tasks, the use ofagile practices requires that the team and organization use alsoadditional plan-driven practices to ensure the efficiency of externalcommunication between all the actors of software development.},

The agile digital detector (ADD) candiscriminate between RFI and natural thermal emission signals bydirectly measuring higher order moments of the signal than the variancethat is traditionally measured. After detection, the ADD then usesspectral filtering methods to selectively remove the RFI.

abstract={While there are many claims for the successful use of extremeprogramming (XP) and agile modeling (AM), and the proponents can oftenbe vocal in the extreme regarding their supposed benefits, researchevidence supporting proponents' claims is somewhat lacking. Currently,the only research appearing to investigate the phenomena consists of twoprominent streams. A small number of case studies and experience reportsthat generally promote the success of XP in various developmentenvironments, and a well-established stream of research into pairprogramming has generated results that in part support the idea of XPResearch into AM appears to be even more sparse than that for XP Casestudies, comparative analyses, and experience reports comprise themajority of the research in the area, while very few empirical researchefforts have been conducted. This article reviews the state of researchin XP and AM, and recommends areas that could benefit from furtherstudy. Since nearly all empirical XP research relates to pairprogramming, a closer look into the unstudied XP core practices would bebeneficial, although interaction between related core practice areascould confound such efforts. It might also be possible to group relatedcore XP concepts and study the groups individually. Finally, there arethose who claim that XP and AM, or even agility in general, are reallynothing more than a repackaging of old concepts. This claim needs to beinvestigated.},

abstract={Background: Capsule endoscopy (CE) of the small bowel has become astandard diagnostic tool, but there have been concerns regarding therisk of capsule retention in certain high-risk groups. The Agile patencysystem, an ingestible and dissolvable capsule with an external scanner,was developed to allow physicians to perform CE with greater confidencethat the capsule will be safely excreted in patients at risk for capsuleretention.Objective: Our purpose was to assess the ability of the device to helpphysicians identify which patients with known strictures may safelyundergo CE.Design: Patients with known strictures ingested the new patency capsuleand under-went periodic scanning until it was excreted. The intestinaltract was considered to be sufficiently patent if the capsule wasexcreted intact or if the capsule was not detected by the scanner at 30hours after ingestion. if patency was established, then standard CE wasperformed.Setting: International multicenter study.Patients: A total of 106 patients with known strictures.Intervention: Agile patency system.Main Outcome Measurements: Performance and safety of Agile patencysystem.Results: A total of 106 patients ingested the patency capsule.Fifty-nine (56{\%}) excreted it intact and subsequently underwent CE.There were no cases of capsule retention. Significant findings on CEwere found in 24 (41{\%}). There were 3 severe adverse events.Conclusions: These results suggest that the Agile patency system is auseful tool for physicians to use before CE in patients with stricturesto avoid retention. This group of patients may have a high yield ofclinically significant findings at CE. This capsule may determinewhether patients who have a contraindication to CE may safely undergo CEand obtain useful diagnostic information.},

abstract={Tougher competitive situations have led to increasing attention beingpaid to customer satisfaction, of which timely and customized servicesare the key concepts. As the product life cycle becomes shortened, highproduct quality becomes necessary for survival. Markets become highlydiversified and global, and continuous and unexpected change become thekey factors for success. The need for a method of rapidly andcost-effectively developing products, production facilities andsupporting software, including design, process planning and shop floorcontrol system has led to the concept of agile manufacturing.Agile manufacturing can be defined as the capability to survive andprosper in a competitive environment of continuous and unpredictablechange by reacting quickly and effectively to changing markets, drivenby customer-designed products and services. This article details the keyconcepts and enablers of agile manufacturing. The key enablers of agilemanufacturing include: (i) virtual enterprise formation tools/metrics;(ii) physically distributed manufacturing architecture and teams; (iii)rapid partnership formation tools/metrics; (iv) concurrent engineering;(v) integrated product/production/business information system; (vi)rapid prototyping tools; and (vii) electronic commerce. A conceptualframework for the development of an agile manufacturing system andfuture research directions are presented in this paper. This frameworktakes into account the customization and system integration with thehelp of business process redesign, legal issues, concurrent engineering,computer-integrated manufacturing, cost management, total qualitymanagement and information technology.},

abstract={A novel basis for beam steering with electrowetting microprisms (EMPs)is reported. EMPs utilize electrowetting modulation of liquid contactangle in order to mimic the refractive behavior for various classicalprism geometries. Continuous beam steering through an angle of 14degrees (+/- 7 degrees) has been demonstrated with a liquid index ofn=1.359. Experimental results are well-matched to theoretical behaviorup to the point of electrowetting contact-angle saturation. Projectionsshow that use of higher index liquids (n similar to 1.6) will result insteering through similar to 30 degrees(+/- 15 degrees). Fundamentalfactors defining achievable deflection range, and issues for Ladar use,are reviewed. This approach is capable of good switching speed (similarto ms), polarization independent operation, modulation of beamfield-of-view (lensing), and high steering efficiency that isindependent of deflection angle.

abstract={Western populations of the Italian agile frog (Rana latastei) experiencewidespread genetic depletion. Based on population genetic theory,molecular models of immunity and previous empirical studies, populationgenetic depletion predicts increased susceptibility of populations toemergent pathogens. We experimentally compared susceptibility of R.latastei populations upon exposure to an emerging strain of Ranavirus,frog virus 3 (FV3), using six populations spanning the geographicalrange and range of population genetic diversity found in nature. Ourfindings confirm this prediction, suggesting that the loss of geneticdiversity accompanying range expansion and population isolation iscoincident with increased mortality risk from an emergent pathogen. Lossof heterozygosity and escape from selection imposed by immunologicallycross-reactive pathogens may potentially generate range-wide variationin disease resistance.},

abstract={In modern business environments, an effective supply chain management(SCM) is crucial to business continuity. Competition between supplychains (SC) has replaced the traditional competition between companies.Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green (LARG) paradigms are advocated as thefoundation of a competitive SCM. To make a supply chain morecompetitive, capable of responding to the demands of customers withagility and capable of responding effectively to unexpected disturbance,in conjugation with environmental responsibilities and the necessity toeliminate processes that add no value, companies must implement a set ofLARG SCM practices and key performance indicators (KPI) to measure theirinfluence on the SC performance. However, the selection of the best LARGSCM practices and KPIs is a complex problem, involving dependencies andfeedbacks. This paper proposes an integrated LARG analytic networkprocess (ANP) model to support decision-making in choosing the mostappropriate practices and KPIs to be implemented by companies in an SC.To validate the model in an exploratory approach, a case study in anautomaker supply chain is presented.},

For the first time,AGILE-MCAL detects photons associated with TGF events up to 40 MeV. Wedetermine the cumulative spectral properties of the spectrum in therange 0.5-40 MeV, which can be effectively described by a Bremsstrahlungspectrum.

abstract={In response to changing success factors and environmental pressures,companies are aspiring to break out of mass production and become leanor agile. Whereas performance enhancements of lean practices have beendemonstrated, it is now the case that markets have become increasinglycharacterized by turbulence, a situation in which reliance on leanpractices is insufficient, and that survival requires adoption of agilepractices. As a result, a comparative study of lean and agilemanufacturing with a related survey of current practices in the UK wascarried out, the results of which is presented in this paper. The paperexplored the threats to lean and the drivers of agile manufacturing.Using data from a questionnaire survey, four hypotheses were tested,which was indicative of the benefits of agile manufacturing. In contrastto their lean counterparts, agile companies paid attention to a widerrange of competitive capabilities. They therefore had a lower range ofmean scores on competitive capabilities. Independent sample tests ofsignificant difference in business performance measures revealed thatthe agile companies consistently outperformed their lean competitors onall business performance measures studied. In addition, a wider range ofcompetitive capabilities and performance measures of the agile companiescorrelated significantly and positively whilst such correlation wasobserved for only a narrow range of capabilities and performancemeasures for lean companies. The results suggest that competingsimultaneously on multiple competitive capabilities enhance performancebetter than a rather narrow focus on cost and quality.},

abstract={Purpose - Lean and agile manufacturing are two initiatives that are usedby manufacturing plant managers to improve operations capabilities. Thepurpose of this paper is to investigate internal and external factorsthat drive the choice of lean and agile operations capabilities andtheir respective impact on operational performance.Design/methodology/approach - Lean and agile manufacturing are eachconceptualized as a second-order factor and measured through a bundle ofdistinct practices. The competitive intensity of industry and thecompetitive strategy are modeled as potential external and internaldrivers, respectively, and the impact on quality, delivery, cost, andflexibility performance is analyzed using structural equations modeling.The model is tested with data from the high performance manufacturingproject comprising a total of 211 plants from three industries and sevencountries.Findings - The results indicate that lean and agile manufacturing differin terms of drivers and outcomes. The choice of a cost-leadershipstrategy fully mediates the impact of the competitive intensity ofindustry as a driver of lean manufacturing, while agile manufacturing isdirectly affected by both internal and external drivers, i.e. adifferentiation strategy as well as the competitive intensity ofindustry. Agile manufacturing is found to be negatively associated witha cost-leadership strategy, emphasizing the difference between lean andagile manufacturing. The major differences in performance outcomes arerelated to cost and flexibility, such that lean manufacturing has asignificant impact on cost performance (whereas agile manufacturing hasnot), and that agile manufacturing has a stronger relationship withvolume as well as product mix flexibility than does lean manufacturing.Research limitations/implications - Cross-sectional data from threeindustries and seven countries are used, and it would be interesting totest this model for more industries and countries.Practical implications - The results provide insights into the factorsthat influence the choice of lean or agile manufacturing for improvingoperations, and the results that can be obtained.Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the firstlarge-scale empirical survey of leanness and agility simultaneously,using data from manufacturing firms in Europe, Asia, and North America.The model incorporates a wide perspective on factors related to lean andagile manufacturing, to be able to identify similarities anddifferences.},

The goals of bioroboticsare to take inspiration from biological principles to design robots thatmatch the agility of animals, and to use robots as scientific tools toinvestigate animal adaptive behavior. Used as physical models, biorobotscontribute to hypothesis testing in fields such as hydrodynamics,biomechanics, neuroscience, and prosthetics. Their use may contribute tothe design of prosthetic devices that more closely take human locomotionprinciples into account.},

abstract={With the emergence of a business era that embraces `change' as one ofits major characteristics, manufacturing success and survival arebecoming more and more difficult to ensure. The emphasis is onadaptability to changes in the business environment and on addressingmarket and customer needs proactively. Changes in the businessenvironment due to varying needs of the customers lead to uncertainty inthe decision parameters. Flexibility is needed in the supply chain tocounter the uncertainty in the decision parameters. A supply chainadapts the changes if it is flexible and agile in nature. A framework ispresented in this paper, which encapsulates the market sensitiveness,process integration, information driver and flexibility measures ofsupply chain performance. The paper explores the relationship amonglead-time, cost, quality, and service level and the leanness and agilityof a case supply chain in fast moving consumer goods business.

This catalog is based on Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector(GRID) data for energies greater than 100 MeV. For the first AGILEcatalog, we adopted a conservative analysis, with a high-quality eventfilter optimized to select gamma-ray events within the central zone ofthe instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). This is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a completeflux-limited sample due to the non-uniform first-year AGILE skycoverage. The catalog includes 47 sources, 21 of which are associatedwith confirmed or candidate pulsars, 13 with blazars (7 FSRQ, 4 BL Lacs,2 unknown type), 2 with HMXRBs, 2 with SNRs, 1 with a colliding-windbinary system, and 8 with unidentified sources.},

Unfortunately, theworking mechanisms of most of these compounds are difficult to determineand thus remain unknown. In an attempt to address the benefits offormulae based on current biomedical approaches, we analyzed thecomponents of Yinchenhao Tang, a classical formula that has been shownto be clinically effective for treating hepatic injury syndrome. Thethree principal components of Yinchenhao Tang are Artemisia annua L.,Gardenia jasminoids Ellis, and Rheum Palmatum L., whose major activeingredients are 6,7-dimethylesculetin (D), geniposide (G), and rhein(R), respectively. To determine the mechanisms underlying the efficacyof this formula, we conducted a systematic analysis of the therapeuticeffects of the DGR compound using immunohistochemistry, biochemistry,metabolomics, and proteomics. Here, we report that the DGR combinationexerts a more robust therapeutic effect than any one or two of the threeindividual compounds by hitting multiple targets in a rat model ofhepatic injury. Thus, DGR synergistically causes intensified dynamicchanges in metabolic biomarkers, regulates molecular networks throughtarget proteins, has a synergistic/additive effect, and activates bothintrinsic and extrinsic pathways.},

abstract={Despite the popularity of agile methods in software development andincreasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agilityis and how it is achieved. The debate suffers from a lack ofunderstanding of agile concepts and how agile software development ispracticed. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agilesoftware development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agilityand the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded incomplex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles ofcoevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximizeself-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. Theseprinciples are used to study the processes of two software developmentteams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a teamusing a more traditional, waterfall-based development cycle. From thecases a framework for the organization of agile software development isdeveloped. Time pacing, self-management with discipline androutinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in thecases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack ofresources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors toagility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identified fromthe research include coevolution of business value, sustainable workingwith rhythm, sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness.},

abstract={As business and technology environments change at an unprecedented rate,software development agility to respond to changing user requirementshas become increasingly critical for software development performance.Agile software development approaches, which emphasizesense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, andcontinuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number oforganizations to improve their software development agility. However,the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive,lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support theprinciples and practices of agile development. Little research hasempirically examined the software development agility construct in termsof its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software developmentperformance. As a result, there is a lack of understanding about howorganizations can effectively implement an agile development approach.Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative andqualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agiledevelopment by empirically examining the relationships among twodimensions of software development agility (software team responseextensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedentsthat can be con trolled (team autonomy and team diversity), and threeaspects of software development performance (on-time completion,on-budget completion, and software functionality). Our PLS results ofsurvey, responses of 399 software project managers suggest that therelationships among these variables are more complex than what has beenperceived by the literature. The results suggest a tradeoff relationshipbetween response extensiveness and response efficiency. These twoagility dimensions impact software development performance differently:response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion,on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas responseextensiveness positively affects only software functionality. Theresults also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect onresponse efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, andthat team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness, Weconducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate ourPLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex,dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, andperformance. The qualitative analysis also provides explanations forboth supported and unsupported hypotheses. We discuss these qualitativeanalysis results and conclude with the theoretical and practicalimplications of our research findings for agile development approaches.},

The purpose of this research paper is toanalyse agile manufacturing in Spain and study whether it is a criticalfactor for success in different industries.Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model is drawn up, based onthe literature and a previous case study, to relate turbulence in theenvironment with agile manufacturing practices and business performance.The model is tested on a large sample of Spanish manufacturers using asurvey methodology to obtain information and a structural equation modelto analyse the data.Findings - The results obtained show that, in turbulent environments,the integrated use of agile manufacturing practices promotesmanufacturing competitive strength, leading to better operational,market and financial performance.Research limitations/implications - This study has two main limitations.First, it is difficult to determine the most suitable unit of analysiswhen studying agile manufacturing. Second, single respondent bias may beconsidered a limitation.Practical implications - Managers should consider the integratedimplementation of agile manufacturing practices in order to developmanufacturing strength and to outperform competitors in turbulentbusiness environments.Originality/value - This study adopts a systematic approach to theanalysis of agile manufacturing, considering various agility practicesor enablers in an integrated way and relating them not only toenvironmental characteristics but also to business performance. Thisapproach is especially interesting because most of the literature onagile manufacturing deals with agility strategies or techniques in anisolated way.

abstract={Tailoring of methods is commonplace in the vast majority of softwaredevelopment projects and organisations. However, there is not much knownabout the tailoring and engineering of agile methods, or about how thesemethods can be used to complement each other. This study investigatedtailoring of the agile methods, eXtreme programming (XP) and Scrum, atIntel Shannon, and involved experienced software engineers whocontinuously monitored and reflected on these methods over a 3- yearperiod. The study shows that agile methods may individually beincomplete in supporting the overall development process, but XP andScrum complement each other well, with XP providing support fortechnical aspects and Scrum providing support for project planning andtracking. The principles of XP and Scrum were carefully selected (onlysix of the 12 XP key practices were implemented, for example) andtailored to suit the needs of the development environment at IntelShannon. Thus, the study refutes the suggestion that agile methods arenot divisible or individually selectable but achieve their benefitsthrough the synergistic combination of individual agile practices;rather, this study shows that an a la carte selection and tailoring ofpractices can work very well. In the case of Scrum, some local tailoringhas led to a very committed usage by developers, in contrast to manydevelopment methods whose usage is limited despite being decreedmandatory by management. The agile practices that were applied did leadto significant benefits, including reductions in code defect density bya factor of 7. Projects of 6-month and 1-year duration have beendelivered ahead of schedule, which bodes well for future ability toaccurately plan development projects.},

title={Code aperture optimization for spectrally agile compressive imaging},
author={Arguello, Henry and Arce, Gonzalo R},
abstract={Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) provides a mechanismfor capturing a 3D spectral cube with a single shot 2D measurement. Inmany applications selective spectral imaging is sought since relevantinformation often lies within a subset of spectral bands. Capturing andreconstructing all the spectral bands in the observed image cube, tothen throw away a large portion of this data, is inefficient. To thisend, this paper extends the concept of CASSI to a system admittingmultiple shot measurements, which leads not only to higher quality ofreconstruction but also to spectrally selective imaging when thesequence of code aperture patterns is optimized. The aperture codeoptimization problem is shown to be analogous to the optimization of aconstrained multichannel filter bank. The optimal code apertures allowthe decomposition of the CASSI measurement into several subsets, eachhaving information from only a few selected spectral bands. The richtheory of compressive sensing is used to effectively reconstruct thespectral bands of interest from the measurements. A number ofsimulations are developed to illustrate the spectral imagingcharacteristics attained by optimal aperture codes. (C) 2011 OpticalSociety of America},

Multipleregression techniques were used, both at the full regression model andat the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure.The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported,identifying three critical success factors for Agile softwaredevelopment projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile SoftwareEngineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability.Limitations of the study are discussed together with interpretations forpractitioners. To ensure success of their projects, managers are urgedto focus on choosing a high-caliber team, practicing Agile engineeringtechniques and following Agile-style delivery strategy.

abstract={This article concerns the problem of managing the new generation ofAgile Earth Observing Satellites (AEOS). This kind of satellites ispresently studied by the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales(PLEIADES project). The mission of an Earth Observing Satellite is toacquire images of specified areas on the Earth surface, in response toobservation requests from customers. Whereas non-agile satellites suchas SPOT5 have only one degree of freedom for acquiring images, the newgeneration satellites have three, giving opportunities for a moreefficient use of the satellite imaging capabilities. Counterwise to thisadvantage, the selection and scheduling of observations becomessignificantly more difficult, due to the larger search space forpotential solutions. Hence, selecting and scheduling observations ofagile satellites is a highly combinatorial problem. This article setsout the overall problem and analyses its difficulties. Then it presentsdifferent methods which have been investigated in order to solve asimplified version of the complete problem: a greedy algorithm, adynamic programming algorithm, a constraint programming approach and alocal search method.

When compared with computerintegrated manufacturing, agile manufacturing can be defined as thecapability of surviving and prospering in a competitive environment ofcontinuous and unpredictable change by reacting quickly and effectivelyto changing markets, driven by customer-designed products and services.Critical to successfully accomplishing agile manufacturing are a fewenabling technologies such as the standard for the exchange of products(STEP), concurrent engineering, virtual manufacturing, component-basedheterarchical shop floor control system, information and communicationinfrastructure, etc. This article details key concepts of those enablingtechnologies and presents various activities related to agilemanufacturing under development in Korea, especially an agilemanufacturing test-bed at Pohang University of Science and Technologyand a prototype of the life cycle engineering study of a product modelmade in a consumer electronic industry.

abstract={A evolutionary transformation of the business environment, with changeas a main characteristic, is taking place. Manufacturing companies, eventhose operating in relatively stable conditions with good marketpositions, are facing rapid and often unanticipated changes in theirbusiness environment. Agile manufacturing is proposed in response to thecircumstances as a solution and is perceived as a vital characteristicthat manufacturing companies need to have in order to maintain theircompetitive advantages in the new order of world business, Each companywill respond in a specific and different way to the changingcircumstances by deploying its own agile characteristics. Agility inmanufacturing may be achieved through the implementation and integrationof appropriate practices which provide the required abilities for acompany to respond properly to changes. Based on this concept, amethodology is applied in two manufacturing companies and data collectedfrom the applications are used to validate the methodology. This paperprovides a brief summary of the methodology and details itsimplementation and validation in the two case study companies. Practicesare proposed to support the achievement of agility in the twoorganisations.},

abstract={Wireless networks and devices have rapidly been gaining popularity overtheir wired counterparts. This popularity, in turn, has been generatingan explosive and ever-increasing demand for, and hence creating ashortage of, the radio spectrum. The reason for this foreseen spectrumshortage is reported not to be the scarcity of the radio spectrum butthe inefficiency of current spectrum access methods, thus leavingspectrum opportunities along both the time and frequency dimensions thatwireless devices can exploit. Fortunately, recent technological advanceshave made it possible to build software-defined radios (SDRs), which,unlike traditional radios, can switch from one frequency band to anotherat little or no cost. We propose a MAC protocol, called OpportunisticSpectrum MAC (OS-MAC), for wireless networks equipped with cognitiveradios like SDRs. OS-MAC 1) adaptively and dynamically seeks andexploits opportunities in both licensed and unlicensed spectra and alongboth the time and frequency dimensions, 2) accesses and shares spectrumamong different unlicensed and licensed users, and 3) coordinates withother unlicensed users for better spectrum utilization. Using extensivesimulation, OS-MAC is shown to be far more effective than current accessprotocols from both the network's and the user's perspectives. Bycomparing its performance with an Ideal-MAC protocol, OS-MAC is alsoshown to not only outperform current access protocols, but also achieveperformance very close to that obtainable under the Ideal-MAC protocol.},

abstract={This paper seeks to contribute towards the construction and application of a method to assess the long-term impact of the development of their technological technologies on the environment. The paper identifies the effect of three pervasive technologies – biotechnology, information technology and nanotechnology – on the production of a range of sectors and their consequent environmental effects. The sectors are selected according to taxonomies of characteristics. The technological impact is assessed qualitatively in terms of changes in production scale and resource intensity and their resulting impact on industrial greenhouse gas emissions},

abstract={During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

Puckette, "Calculation of a narrowed autocorrelation function," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 85, 1595?1601 (1989)] or of a narrow valley in the calculation of an inverse autocorrelation [J. C. Brown and M. S. Puckette, "Musical information from a narrowed autocorrelation function," Proceedings of the 1987 International Conference on Computer Music, Urbana, Illinois, 84?88 (1987)]. These calculations are applied to the determination of the fundamental frequency of musical signals produced by keyboard, wind, and string instruments. These results are compared to frequency tracking results obtained on these sounds with conventional autocorrelation. In so doing it is determined first whether the method of autocorrelation is well-adapted to the problem of tracking the frequency of musical signals, and, second, under what conditions "narrowed" autocorrelation is advantageous. {\textcopyright}1991 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={A method based on the Fourier convolution theorem is developed for the analysis of data composed of random noise, plus an unknown constant "base line," plus a sum of (or an integral over a continuous spectrum of) exponential decay functions. The Fourier method's usual serious practical limitation of needing high accuracy data over a very wide range is eliminated by the introduction of convergence parameters and a Gaussian taper window. A computer program is described for the analysis of discrete spectra, where the data involves only a sum of exponentials. The program is completely automatic in that the only necessary inputs are the raw data (not necessarily in equal intervals of time); no potentially biased initial guesses concerning either the number or the values of the components are needed. The outputs include the number of components, the amplitudes and time constants together with their estimated errors, and a spectral plot of the solution. The limiting resolving power of the method is studied by analyzing a wide range of simulated two-, three-, and four-component data. The results seem to indicate that the method is applicable over a considerably wider range of conditions than nonlinear least squares or the method of moments. {\textcopyright} 1976, The Biophysical Society.

abstract={This paper discusses the use of symmetric convolution and the$\backslash$ndiscrete sine and cosine transforms (DSTs and DCTs) for general digital$\backslash$nsignal processing. The operation of symmetric convolution is a$\backslash$nformalized approach to convolving symmetrically extended sequences. The$\backslash$nresult is the same as that obtained by taking an inverse discrete$\backslash$ntrigonometric transform (DTT) of the product of the forward DTTs of$\backslash$nthose two sequences. There are 16 members in the family of DTTs. Each$\backslash$nprovides a representation for a corresponding distinct type of$\backslash$nsymmetric-periodic sequence. The author defines symmetric convolution,$\backslash$nrelates the DSTs and DCTs to symmetric-periodic sequences, and then use$\backslash$nthese principles to develop simple but powerful$\backslash$nconvolution-multiplication properties for the entire family of DSTs and$\backslash$nDCTs. Symmetric convolution can be used for discrete linear filtering$\backslash$nwhen the filter is symmetric or antisymmetric. The filtering will be$\backslash$nefficient because fast algorithms exist for all versions of the DTTs.$\backslash$nConventional linear convolution is possible if one first zero-pad the$\backslash$ninput data.

The model consists of start, attack, sustain, release, and end segments with variable split-point amplitude and time. The estimation of the times is done using smoothed derivatives of the envelopes. The estimated split-point values can be used together with a curve-form model introduced in this paper in the analysis/synthesis of musical sounds. The envelope model can recreate noise-less musical sounds with good fidelity, and the method for the estimation of the envelope times performs significantly better than the classical percentage- based method.},

abstract={With an optimal network topology and tuning of hyperpa-rameters, artificial neural networks (ANNs) may be trained to learn a mapping from low level audio features to one or more higher-level representations. Such artificial neu-ral networks are commonly used in classification and re-gression settings to perform arbitrary tasks. In this work we suggest repurposing autoencoding neural networks as musical audio synthesizers. We offer an interactive musi-cal audio synthesis system that uses feedforward artificial neural networks for musical audio synthesis, rather than discriminative or regression tasks. In our system an ANN is trained on frames of low-level features. A high level representation of the musical audio is learned though an autoencoding neural net. Our real-time synthesis system allows one to interact directly with the parameters of the model and generate musical audio in real time. This work therefore proposes the exploitation of neural networks for creative musical applications.},

abstract={We describe an image compression method, consisting of a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.},

abstract={This paper presents a set of full-resolution lossy image compression methods based on neural networks. Each of the architectures we describe can provide variable compression rates during deployment without requiring retraining of the network: each network need only be trained once. All of our architectures consist of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoder and decoder, a binarizer, and a neural network for entropy coding. We compare RNN types (LSTM, associative LSTM) and introduce a new hybrid of GRU and ResNet. We also study "one-shot" versus additive reconstruction architectures and introduce a new scaled-additive framework. We compare to previous work, showing improvements of 4.3{\%}-8.8{\%} AUC (area under the rate-distortion curve), depending on the perceptual metric used. As far as we know, this is the first neural network architecture that is able to outperform JPEG at image compression across most bitrates on the rate-distortion curve on the Kodak dataset images, with and without the aid of entropy coding.},

This optimized mapping extends the use of the NeuCube, which was initially designed for spatiotemporal brain data, to work on arbitrary stream data and to achieve a better accuracy of temporal pattern recognition, a better and earlier event prediction and a better understanding of complex temporal stream data through visualization of the NeuCube connectivity. The effect of the new mapping is demonstrated on three bench mark problems. The first one is early prediction of patient sleep stage event from temporal physiological data. The second one is pattern recognition of dynamic temporal patterns of traffic in the Bay Area of California and the last one is the Challenge 2012 contest data set. In all cases the use of the proposed mapping leads to an improved accuracy of pattern recognition and event prediction and a better understanding of the data when compared to traditional machine learning techniques or spiking neural network reservoirs with arbitrary mapping of the variables.},

New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.},

abstract={This paper presents a psychological contract perspective on the use of the open source development model as a global sourcing strategy-opensourcing, as we term it here-whereby commerical companies and open source communities collaborate on development of software of commercial interest to the company. Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product. We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness: The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises. It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.},

abstract={We introduce a parametric nonlinear transformation that is well-suited for Gaussianizing data from natural images. The data are linearly transformed, and each component is then normalized by a pooled activity measure, computed by exponentiating a weighted sum of rectified and exponentiated components and a constant. We optimize the parameters of the full transformation (linear transform, exponents, weights, constant) over a database of natural images, directly minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The optimized transformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantly smaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative methods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is differentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a density model on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to samples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as a prior probability density that can be used to remove additive noise. Finally, we show that the transformation can be cascaded, with each layer optimized using the same Gaussianization objective, thus offering an unsupervised method of optimizing a deep network architecture.},

One dimension specifies the type of task performed by the algorithm: preprocessing, data reduction/feature extraction, segmentation, object recognition, image understanding and optimisation. The other dimension captures the abstraction level of the input data processed by the algorithm: pixel-level, local feature-level, structure-level, object-level, object-set-level and scene characterisation. Each of the six types of tasks poses specific constraints to a neural-based approach. These specific conditions are discussed in detail. A synthesis is made of unresolved problems related to the application of pattern recognition techniques in image processing and specifically to the application of neural networks.

abstract={A large fraction of Internet traffic is now driven by requests from mobile devices with relatively small screens and often stringent bandwidth requirements. Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will significantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional LSTM recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efficient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}32 thumbnails, our LSTM-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) JPEG, JPEG2000 and WebP, with a storage size that is reduced by 10{\%} or more.},

abstract={Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an alternative type of neural network that can be used to reduce spectral variations and model spectral correlations which exist in signals. Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by CNNs as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the CNN framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 LVCSR tasks indicate that a CNN with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12{\%}-14{\%} relative improvement in WER over a strong DNN system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks.},

abstract={Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) have been applied to various speech applications including acoustic modeling for statistical parametric speech synthesis. One of the con- cerns for applying them to text-to-speech applications is its effect on latency. To address this concern, this paper proposes a low-latency, streaming speech synthesis architecture using unidirectional LSTM- RNNs with a recurrent output layer. The use of unidirectional RNN architecture allows frame-synchronous streaming inference of out- put acoustic features given input linguistic features. The recurrent output layer further encourages smooth transition between acoustic features at consecutive frames. Experimental results in subjective listening tests show that the proposed architecture can synthesize natural sounding speech without requiring utterance-level batch pro- cessing.},

Unless the user has considerable artistic skill, it is easy to "fall off" the manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we propose to learn the natural image manifold directly from data using a generative adversarial neural network. We then define a class of image editing operations, and constrain their output to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The model automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic as possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of constrained optimization and are applied in near-real time. We evaluate our algorithm on the task of realistic photo manipulation of shape and color.

abstract={We introduce a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for music tagging. CRNNs take advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal summarisation of the extracted features. We compare CRNN with three CNN structures that have been used for music tagging while controlling the number of parameters with respect to their performance and training time per sample. Overall, we found that CRNNs show a strong performance with respect to the number of parameter and training time, indicating the effectiveness of its hybrid structure in music feature extraction and feature summarisation.},

We introduce a probabilistic model based on a recurrent neural network that is able to learn realistic output distributions given the input and we devise an efficient algorithm to search for the global mode of that distribution. The resulting method produces musically plausible transcriptions even under high levels of noise and drastically outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on five datasets of synthesized sounds and real recordings, approximately halving the test error rate.},

title={Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition},
year={2012},
abstract={Most current speech recognition systems use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to deal with the temporal variability of speech and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to determine how well each state of each HMM fits a frame or a short window of frames of coefficients that represents the acoustic input. An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition.},

abstract={Different types of sentences express sentiment in very different ways. Traditional sentence-level sentiment classification research focuses on one-technique-fits-all solution or only centers on one special type of sentences. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which first classifies sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we find that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to first apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classification datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classification can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.},

abstract={The ventral visual pathway implements object recognition and categorization in a hierarchy of processing areas with neuronal selectivities of increasing complexity. The presence of massive feedback connections within this hierarchy raises the possibility that normal visual processing relies on the use of computational loops. It is not known, however, whether object recognition can be performed at all without such loops (i.e., in a purely feed-forward mode). By analyzing the time course of reaction times in a masked natural scene categorization paradigm, we show that the human visual system can generate selective motor responses based on a single feed-forward pass. We confirm these results using a more constrained letter discrimination task, in which the rapid succession of a target and mask is actually perceived as a distractor. We show that a masked stimulus presented for only 26 msecand often not consciously perceivedcan fully determine the earliest selective motor responses: The neural representations of the stimulus and mask are thus kept separated during a short period corresponding to the feedforward sweep. Therefore, feedback loops do not appear to be mandatory for visual processing. Rather, we found that such loops allow the masked stimulus to reverberate in the visual system and affect behavior for nearly 150 msec after the feed-forward sweep.},

abstract={This paper presents our system design for the Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge (AV +EC 2015). Besides the baseline features, we extract from audio the functionals on low-level descriptors (LLDs) obtained via the YAAFE toolbox, and from video the Local Phase Quantization from Three Or- thogonal Planes (LPQ-TOP) features. From the physiologi- cal signals, we extract 52 electro-cardiogram (ECG) features and 22 electro-dermal activity (EDA) features from various analysis domains. The extracted features along with the AV +EC 2015 baseline features of audio, ECG or EDA are concatenated for a further feature selection step, in which the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), instead of the usual Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), has been used as objective function. In addition, offsets between the features and the arousal/valence labels are considered in both feature selection and modeling of the affective dimensions. For the fusion of multimodal features, we propose a Deep Bidirec- tional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM-RNN) based multimodal affect prediction frame- work, in which the initial predictions from the single modali- ties via the DBLSTM-RNNs are firstly smoothed with Gaus- sian smoothing, then input into a second layer of DBLSTM- RNN for the final prediction of affective state. Experimental results show that our proposed features and the DBLSTM- RNN based fusion framework obtain very promising results. On the development set, the obtained CCC is up to 0.824 for arousal and 0.688 for valence, and on the test set, the CCC is 0.747 for arousal and 0.609 for valence},

title={Peak-Piloted Deep Network for Facial Expression Recognition},
abstract={Objective functions for training of deep networks for face-related recognition tasks, such as facial expression recognition (FER), usually consider each sample independently. In this work, we present a novel peak-piloted deep network (PPDN) that uses a sample with peak expression (easy sample) to supervise the intermediate feature responses for a sample of non-peak expression (hard sample) of the same type and from the same subject. The expression evolving process from non-peak expression to peak expression can thus be implicitly embedded in the network to achieve the invariance to expression intensities. A special purpose back-propagation procedure, peak gradient suppression (PGS), is proposed for network training. It drives the intermediate-layer feature responses of non-peak expression samples towards those of the corresponding peak expression samples, while avoiding the inverse. This avoids degrading the recognition capability for samples of peak expression due to interference from their non-peak expression counterparts. Extensive comparisons on two popular FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and CK+, demonstrate the superiority of the PPDN over state-ofthe-art FER methods, as well as the advantages of both the network structure and the optimization strategy. Moreover, it is shown that PPDN is a general architecture, extensible to other tasks by proper definition of peak and non-peak samples. This is validated by experiments that show state-of-the-art performance on pose-invariant face recognition, using the Multi-PIE dataset.},

The harmonic part is able to adapt to the music content, allowing the algorithm to work in polyphonic mixtures. Drum event times can be simply picked from the percussive activation matrix with onset detection. The system is efficient and robust even with a minimal training set. The recognition rates for the ENST dataset vary from 56.7 to 78.9{\%} for three percussive instruments extracted from polyphonic music.},

abstract={Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as powerful sequence models have re-emerged as a potential acoustic model for statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS). The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can achieve significantly better performance on SPSS than deep feed-forward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e.g., input gate, output gate, forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simplified architecture. The simplified architecture has significantly fewer parameters than an LSTM, thus reducing generation complexity considerably without degrading quality.},

abstract={Relatively small data sets available for expression recognition research make the training of deep networks for expression recognition very challenging. Although fine-tuning can partially alleviate the issue, the performance is still below acceptable levels as the deep features probably contain redun- dant information from the pre-trained domain. In this paper, we present FaceNet2ExpNet, a novel idea to train an expression recognition network based on static images. We first propose a new distribution function to model the high-level neurons of the expression network. Based on this, a two-stage training algorithm is carefully designed. In the pre-training stage, we train the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In the refining stage, we append fully- connected layers to the pre-trained convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly. Visualization shows that the model trained with our method captures improved high-level expression semantics. Evaluations on four public expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, TFD, and SFEW demonstrate that our method achieves better results than state-of-the-art.},

abstract={Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective models for reducing spectral variations and modeling spectral correlations in acoustic features for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Hybrid speech recognition systems incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models (HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks. Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it feasible to train an end-to-end speech recognition system instead of hybrid settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.},

title={Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks},
number={7639},
publisher={Nature Publishing Group},
abstract={Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy1, 2, 3, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)4, 5 show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets12—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care. 最も多いヒト悪性腫瘍である皮膚がんは、主に視覚的に診断され、初期臨床スクリーニングが行われた後、ダーモスコピー解析、生検、および病理組織検査が行われることがある。画像を用いた皮膚病変の自動分類は、皮膚病変の外観には細かなばらつきがあるため、難しい課題である。深層畳み込みニューラルネットワーク（CNN）には、多くの細かな対象カテゴリー全体にわたり、一般的で変動性の高い課題をこなせる可能性がある。本研究で我々は、入力としてピクセルと疾病ラベルのみを用い、画像からエンドツーエンドで直接学習させた、単一のCNNを用いた皮膚病変の分類を実証する。我々は、2032の異なる疾病からなる12万9450の臨床画像（以前のデータセットよりも2桁多い）のデータセットを用いてCNNを学習させた。我々は生検で確認した臨床画像について、このCNNの成績を21人の皮膚科認定医と比較検証した。ここでは「角化細胞がん」対「良性脂漏性角化症」、「悪性黒色腫」対「良性母斑」という、2つの重要な二項分類使用症例を用いた。前者は最も多いがんの識別であり、後者は最も致命的な皮膚がんの識別である。CNNはどちらの課題においても、試験に参加した全ての専門家と同等の成績を達成したことから、人工知能は皮膚科医に相当する能力で皮膚がんを分類できることが示された。深層ニューラルネットワークを装備した携帯デバイスにより、皮膚科医の診察が診療所の外でも受けられる可能性がある。2021年までにスマートフォン契約者は63億人に達すると見込まれ、従って、重要な診断があらゆる場所で安価に受けられるようになるかもしれない。},

Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture, we propose a "fabric" that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size.

eprint={1703.10135},
abstract={A text-to-speech synthesis system typically consists of multiple stages, such as a text analysis frontend, an acoustic model and an audio synthesis module. Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given {\textless}text, audio{\textgreater} pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.},

abstract={Extreme learning machine (ELM), as a new learning framework, draws increasing attractions in the areas of large-scale computing, high-speed signal processing, artificial intelligence, and so on. ELM aims to break the barriers between the conventional artificial learning techniques and biological learning mechanism and represents a suite of machine learning techniques in which hidden neurons need not to be tuned. ELM theories and algorithms argue that “random hidden neurons” capture the essence of some brain learning mechanisms as well as the intuitive sense that the efficiency of brain learning need not rely on computing power of neurons. Thus, compared with traditional neural networks and support vector machine, ELM offers significant advantages such as fast learning speed, ease of implementation, and minimal human intervention. Due to its remarkable generalization performance and implementation efficiency, ELM has been applied in various applications. In this paper, we first provide an overview of newly derived ELM theories and approaches. On the other hand, with the ongoing development of multilayer feature representation, some new trends on ELM-based hierarchical learning are discussed. Moreover, we also present several interesting ELM applications to showcase the practical advances on this subject.},

abstract={— Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parame-ters are randomly generated and the output weights are analyti-cally computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via 1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.

abstract={In this paper, we choose to learn useful cues from object recognition mechanisms of the human vi-sual cortex, and propose a DCNN performance im-provement method without the need for increasing the network complexity. Inspired by the category-selective property of the neuron population in the IT layer of the human visual cortex, we enforce the neuron responses at the top DCNN layer to be category selective. To achieve this, we propose the Sparse Category-Selective Objective Function (SCSOF) to modulate the neuron outputs of the top DCNN layer. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to any DCNN models. As ex-perimental results show, when applying the pro-posed method to the " Quick " model and NIN models, image classification performances are re-markably improved on four widely used bench-mark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST and SVHN, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.},

abstract={Deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations are currently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets. The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activation functions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with the use of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classification of similar input examples. During the training process, these subnetworks avoid overfitting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they must share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we have made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance of such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial distribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear activation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear activation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can result in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions. Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial distribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the introduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these activation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with a relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch normalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models. We show that by introducing maxout and batch normalisation units to the network in network model results in a model that produces classification results that are better than or comparable to the current state of the art in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets.},

abstract={In this paper, a hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network. The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.},

title={Optimizing feedforward artificial neural network architecture},
abstract={Despite the fact that feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been a hot topic of research for many years there still are certain issues regarding the development of an ANN model, resulting in a lack of absolute guarantee that the model will perform well for the problem at hand. The multitude of different approaches that have been adopted in order to deal with this problem have investigated all aspects of the ANN modelling procedure, from training data collection and pre/post-processing to elaborate training schemes and algorithms. Increased attention is especially directed to proposing a systematic way to establish an appropriate architecture in contrast to the current common practice that calls for a repetitive trial-and-error process, which is time-consuming and produces uncertain results. This paper proposes such a methodology for determining the best architecture and is based on the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and the development of novel criteria that quantify an ANN's performance (both training and generalization) as well as its complexity. This approach is implemented in software and tested based on experimental data capturing workpiece elastic deflection in turning. The intention is to present simultaneously the approach's theoretical background and its practical application in real-life engineering problems. Results show that the approach performs better than a human expert, at the same time offering many advantages in comparison to similar approaches found in literature. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={With the emergence of online social networks, the social network-based recommendation approach is popularly used. The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={This paper reviews the literature on the problem of information overload, with particular reference to business organisations. The literature reveals that although the problem of information overload has existed for many years, in recent years the problem has become more widely recognised and experienced. Both perceptions and the actual effects of information overload have been exacerbated by the rapid advances made in information and communication technology, although it is not clear cut as to whether the Internet has worsened or improved the situation. A theme stressed in the literature is the paradoxical situation that, although there is an abundance of information available, it is often difficult to obtain useful, relevant information when it is needed. Some solutions put forward to reduce information overload are: a reduction in the duplication of information found in the professional literature; the adoption of personal information management strategies, together with the integration of software solutions such as push technology and intelligent agents; and the provision of value-added information (filtered by software or information specialists). An emphasis is placed on technology as a tool and not the driver, while increased information literacy may provide the key to reducing information overload.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a joint segmenta- tion and classification framework for sen- timent analysis. Existing sentiment clas- sification algorithms typically split a sen- tence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent senti- ment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as “not bad” and “a great deal of ”. We address this issue by developing a joint segmentation and classification framework (JSC), which si- multaneously conducts sentence segmen- tation and sentence-level sentiment classi- fication. Specifically, we use a log-linear model to score each segmentation candi- date, and exploit the phrasal information of top-ranked segmentations as features to build the sentiment classifier. A marginal log-likelihood objective function is de- vised for the segmentation model, which is optimized for enhancing the sentiment classification performance. The joint mod- el is trained only based on the annotat- ed sentiment polarity of sentences, with- out any segmentation annotations. Experi- ments on a benchmark Twitter sentimen- t classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that, our joint model performs com- parably with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods.

Here we use image representations derived from Con-volutional Neural Networks optimised for object recogni-tion, which make high level image information explicit. We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can sep-arate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an ar-bitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous well-known artworks.

Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices.

Given {\textless}text, audio{\textgreater} pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.},

year={2007},
journal={Genetic programming and evolvable machines},
abstract={Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

abstract={We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network" (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

abstract={Over the past two decades, the feedforward neural network (FNN) optimization has been a key interest among the researchers and practitioners of multiple disciplines. The FNN optimization is often viewed from the various perspectives: the optimization of weights, network architecture, activation nodes, learning parameters, learning environment, etc. Researchers adopted such different viewpoints mainly to improve the FNN's generalization ability. The gradient-descent algorithm such as backpropagation has been widely applied to optimize the FNNs. Its success is evident from the FNN's application to numerous real-world problems. However, due to the limitations of the gradient-based optimization methods, the metaheuristic algorithms including the evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., are still being widely explored by the researchers aiming to obtain generalized FNN for a given problem. This article attempts to summarize a broad spectrum of FNN optimization methodologies including conventional and metaheuristic approaches. This article also tries to connect various research directions emerged out of the FNN optimization practices, such as evolving neural network (NN), cooperative coevolution NN, complex-valued NN, deep learning, extreme learning machine, quantum NN, etc. Additionally, it provides interesting research challenges for future research to cope-up with the present information processing era.},

abstract={We present a content-based automatic music tagging algorithm using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs). We evaluate different architectures consisting of 2D convolutional layers and subsampling layers only. In the experiments, we measure the AUC-ROC scores of the architectures with different complexities and input types using the MagnaTagATune dataset, where a 4-layer architecture shows state-of-the-art performance with mel-spectrogram input. Furthermore, we evaluated the performances of the architectures with varying the number of layers on a larger dataset (Million Song Dataset), and found that deeper models outperformed the 4-layer architecture. The experiments show that mel-spectrogram is an effective time-frequency representation for automatic tagging and that more complex models benefit from more training data.},

abstract={Relatively small data sets available for expression recognition research make the training of deep networks for expression recognition very challenging. Although fine-tuning can partially alleviate the issue, the performance is still below acceptable levels as the deep features probably contain redun- dant information from the pre-trained domain. In this paper, we present FaceNet2ExpNet, a novel idea to train an expression recognition network based on static images. We first propose a new distribution function to model the high-level neurons of the expression network. Based on this, a two-stage training algorithm is carefully designed. In the pre-training stage, we train the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In the refining stage, we append fully- connected layers to the pre-trained convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly. Visualization shows that the model trained with our method captures improved high-level expression semantics. Evaluations on four public expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, TFD, and SFEW demonstrate that our method achieves better results than state-of-the-art.},

abstract={The ventral visual pathway implements object recognition and categorization in a hierarchy of processing areas with neuronal selectivities of increasing complexity. The presence of massive feedback connections within this hierarchy raises the possibility that normal visual processing relies on the use of computational loops. It is not known, however, whether object recognition can be performed at all without such loops (i.e., in a purely feed-forward mode). By analyzing the time course of reaction times in a masked natural scene categorization paradigm, we show that the human visual system can generate selective motor responses based on a single feed-forward pass. We confirm these results using a more constrained letter discrimination task, in which the rapid succession of a target and mask is actually perceived as a distractor. We show that a masked stimulus presented for only 26 msecand often not consciously perceivedcan fully determine the earliest selective motor responses: The neural representations of the stimulus and mask are thus kept separated during a short period corresponding to the feedforward sweep. Therefore, feedback loops do not appear to be mandatory for visual processing. Rather, we found that such loops allow the masked stimulus to reverberate in the visual system and affect behavior for nearly 150 msec after the feed-forward sweep.},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given {\textless}text, audio{\textgreater} pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.},

abstract={In this work we propose a novel interpretation of residual networks showing that they can be seen as a collection of many paths of differing length. Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.},

abstract={Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an alternative type of neural network that can be used to reduce spectral variations and model spectral correlations which exist in signals. Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by CNNs as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the CNN framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 LVCSR tasks indicate that a CNN with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12{\%}-14{\%} relative improvement in WER over a strong DNN system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks.},

abstract={Presented is a method of generating a full drum kit part for a provided kick-drum sequence. A sequence to sequence neural network model used in natural language translation was adopted to encode multiple musical styles and an online survey was developed to test different techniques for sampling the output of the softmax function. The strongest results were found using a sampling technique that drew from the three most probable outputs at each subdivision of the drum pattern but the consistency of output was found to be heavily dependent on style.},

abstract={Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective models for reducing spectral variations and modeling spectral correlations in acoustic features for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Hybrid speech recognition systems incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models (HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks. Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it feasible to train an end-to-end speech recognition system instead of hybrid settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.},

abstract={A large fraction of Internet traffic is now driven by requests from mobile devices with relatively small screens and often stringent bandwidth requirements. Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will significantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional LSTM recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efficient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}32 thumbnails, our LSTM-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) JPEG, JPEG2000 and WebP, with a storage size that is reduced by 10{\%} or more.},

abstract={Despite the fact that feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been a hot topic of research for many years there still are certain issues regarding the development of an ANN model, resulting in a lack of absolute guarantee that the model will perform well for the problem at hand. The multitude of different approaches that have been adopted in order to deal with this problem have investigated all aspects of the ANN modelling procedure, from training data collection and pre/post-processing to elaborate training schemes and algorithms. Increased attention is especially directed to proposing a systematic way to establish an appropriate architecture in contrast to the current common practice that calls for a repetitive trial-and-error process, which is time-consuming and produces uncertain results. This paper proposes such a methodology for determining the best architecture and is based on the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and the development of novel criteria that quantify an ANN's performance (both training and generalization) as well as its complexity. This approach is implemented in software and tested based on experimental data capturing workpiece elastic deflection in turning. The intention is to present simultaneously the approach's theoretical background and its practical application in real-life engineering problems. Results show that the approach performs better than a human expert, at the same time offering many advantages in comparison to similar approaches found in literature. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy1–3, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)4,5 show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories6–11. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets12—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

We introduce Monte Carlo crogging which combines bootstrapping and cross-validation (CV) in a single approach through repeated random splitting of the original time series into mutually exclusive datasets for training. As the training/validation split is independent of the number of folds, the algorithm offers more flexibility in the size, and number of training samples compared to k-fold cross-validation. The study also provides for crogging and bagging: (1) the first systematic evaluation across time series length and combination size, (2) a bias and variance decomposition of the forecast errors to understand improvement gains, and (3) a comparison to established benchmarks of model averaging and selection. Crogging can easily be extended to other autoregressive models. Results on real and simulated series demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy especially for short time series and long forecast horizons.},

abstract={The Recurrent Neural Networks and their vari-ants have shown promising performances in se-quence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extrac-tors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by fac-torizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained si-multaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using mul-tiple real-world video datasets and achieve com-petitive performances with state-of-the-art mod-els, even though our model architecture is or-ders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential data with RNN architec-tures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional sequential data.},

Discussion of methods of data augmentation is not our primary focus. We show clear evidences that APAC gives far better generalization performance than the traditional way of class prediction in several experiments.

abstract={We present a new self-organizing neural network model that has two variants. The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches (e.g., the Kohonen feature map) is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process that also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method that results from the combination of the above-mentioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible—in contrast to earlier approaches—to perform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks that generalize very well. Results on the two-spirals benchmark and a vowel classification problem are presented that are better than any results previously published.},

abstract={Deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations are currently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets. The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activation functions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with the use of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classification of similar input examples. During the training process, these subnetworks avoid overfitting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they must share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we have made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance of such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial distribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear activation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear activation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can result in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions. Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial distribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the introduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these activation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with a relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch normalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models. We show that by introducing maxout and batch normalisation units to the network in network model results in a model that produces classification results that are better than or comparable to the current state of the art in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets.},

Because of the powerfulness of MLP and {\$} 1\backslashtimes 1 {\$} convolutions in spatial domain, NiN has stronger ability of feature representation and hence results in better recognition rate. However, MLP itself consists of fully connected layers which give rise to a large number of parameters. In this paper, we propose to replace dense shallow MLP with sparse shallow MLP. One or more layers of the sparse shallow MLP are sparely connected in the channel dimension or channel-spatial domain. The proposed method is implemented by applying unshared convolution across the channel dimension and applying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational layers. The proposed method is called CiC. Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset, augmented CIFAR10 dataset, and CIFAR100 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CiC method.},

abstract={Music genre recognition based on visual representation has been successfully explored over the last years. Classifiers trained with textural descriptors (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, and Gabor filters) extracted from the spectrograms have achieved state-of-the-art results on several music datasets. In this work, though, we argue that we can go further with the time-frequency analysis through the use of representation learning. To show that, we compare the results obtained with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the results obtained by using handcrafted features and SVM classifiers. In addition, we have performed experiments fusing the results obtained with learned features and handcrafted features to assess the complementarity between these representations for the music classification task. Experiments were conducted on three music databases with distinct characteristics, specifically a western music collection largely used in research benchmarks (ISMIR 2004 Database), a collection of Latin American music (LMD database), and a collection of field recordings of ethnic African music. Our experiments show that the CNN compares favorably to other classifiers in several scenarios, hence, it is a very interesting alternative for music genre recognition. Considering the African database, the CNN surpassed the handcrafted representations and also the state-of-the-art by a margin. In the case of the LMD database, the combination of CNN and Robust Local Binary Pattern achieved a recognition rate of 92{\%}, which to the best of our knowledge, is the best result (using an artist filter) on this dataset so far. On the ISMIR 2004 dataset, although the CNN did not improve the state of the art, it performed better than the classifiers based individually on other kind of features.},

abstract={We propose to study links between three important classification algorithms: Perceptrons, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We first study ways to control the capacity of Perceptrons (mainly regularization parameters and early stopping), using the margin idea introduced with SVMs. After showing that under simple conditions a Perceptron is equivalent to an SVM, we show it can be computationally expensive in time to train an SVM (and thus a Perceptron) with stochastic gradient descent, mainly because of the margin maximization term in the cost function. We then show that if we remove this margin maximization term, the learning rate or the use of early stopping can still control the margin. These ideas are extended afterward to the case of MLPs. Moreover, under some assumptions it also appears that MLPs are a kind of mixture of SVMs, maximizing the margin in the hidden layer space. Finally, we present a very simple MLP based on the previous findings, which yields better performances in generalization and speed than the other models.},

abstract={Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet.

abstract={Image Compression is a demanding field in this era of communication. There is a need to study and analyze the literature for image compression, as the demand for images, video sequences and computer animation has increased at very high rate so that the increment is drastically over the years. Multimedia data whether graphics, audio, video data which is uncompress requires considerable transmission bandwidth and storage capacity. So this leads to the need of compression of images and all multimedia applications to save storage and transmission time.

abstract={Despite the success of CNNs, selecting the optimal architecture for a given task remains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture, we propose a "fabric" that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size. We present benchmark results competitive with the state of the art for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR10, and for semantic segmentation on the Part Labels dataset.},

abstract={Evolving gradient-learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a popular approach to address the local optima and design problems of ANN. The typical approach is to combine the strength of backpropagation (BP) in weight learning and EA's capability of searching the architecture space. However, the BP's "gradient descent" approach requires a highly computer-intensive operation that relatively restricts the search coverage of EA by compelling it to use a small population size. To address this problem, we utilized mutation-based genetic neural network (MGNN) to replace BP by using the mutation strategy of local adaptation of evolutionary programming (EP) to effect weight learning. The MGNN's mutation enables the network to dynamically evolve its structure and adapt its weights at the same time. Moreover, MGNN's EP-based encoding scheme allows for a flexible and less restricted formulation of the fitness function and makes fitness computation fast and efficient. This makes it feasible to use larger population sizes and allows MGNN to have a relatively wide search coverage of the architecture space. MGNN implements a stopping criterion where overfitness occurrences are monitored through "sliding-windows" to avoid premature learning and overlearning. Statistical analysis of its performance to some well-known classification problems demonstrate its good generalization capability. It also reveals that locally adapting or scheduling the strategy parameters embedded in each individual network may provide a proper balance between the local and global searching capabilities of MGNN.},

abstract={Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for sequential data. End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates $\backslash$emph{\{}deep recurrent neural networks{\}}, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7{\%} on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.},

abstract={We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.},

abstract={Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has remained a challenging and interesting problem. Despite efforts made in developing various methods for FER, existing approaches traditionally lack generalizability when applied to unseen images or those that are captured in wild setting. Most of the existing approaches are based on engineered features (e.g. HOG, LBPH, and Gabor) where the classifier's hyperparameters are tuned to give best recognition accuracies across a single database, or a small collection of similar databases. Nevertheless, the results are not significant when they are applied to novel data. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture to address the FER problem across multiple well-known standard face datasets. Specifically, our network consists of two convolutional layers each followed by max pooling and then four Inception layers. The network is a single component architecture that takes registered facial images as the input and classifies them into either of the six basic or the neutral expressions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on seven publically available facial expression databases, viz. MultiPIE, MMI, CK+, DISFA, FERA, SFEW, and FER2013. The results of proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods and better than traditional convolutional neural networks and in both accuracy and training time.},

The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can achieve significantly better performance on SPSS than deep feed-forward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e.g., input gate, output gate, forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simplified architecture. The simplified architecture has significantly fewer parameters than an LSTM, thus reducing generation complexity considerably without degrading quality.},

@article{Tsai2006,
abstract={In this paper, a hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network. The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.},

abstract={Realistic image manipulation is challenging because it requires modifying the image appearance in a user-controlled way, while preserving the realism of the result. Unless the user has considerable artistic skill, it is easy to "fall off" the manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we propose to learn the natural image manifold directly from data using a generative adversarial neural network. We then define a class of image editing operations, and constrain their output to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The model automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic as possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of constrained optimization and are applied in near-real time. We evaluate our algorithm on the task of realistic photo manipulation of shape and color. The presented method can further be used for changing one image to look like the other, as well as generating novel imagery from scratch based on user's scribbles.},

abstract={We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

abstract={This paper presents our system design for the Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge (AV +EC 2015). Besides the baseline features, we extract from audio the functionals on low-level descriptors (LLDs) obtained via the YAAFE toolbox, and from video the Local Phase Quantization from Three Or- thogonal Planes (LPQ-TOP) features. From the physiologi- cal signals, we extract 52 electro-cardiogram (ECG) features and 22 electro-dermal activity (EDA) features from various analysis domains. The extracted features along with the AV +EC 2015 baseline features of audio, ECG or EDA are concatenated for a further feature selection step, in which the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), instead of the usual Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), has been used as objective function. In addition, offsets between the features and the arousal/valence labels are considered in both feature selection and modeling of the affective dimensions. For the fusion of multimodal features, we propose a Deep Bidirec- tional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM-RNN) based multimodal affect prediction frame- work, in which the initial predictions from the single modali- ties via the DBLSTM-RNNs are firstly smoothed with Gaus- sian smoothing, then input into a second layer of DBLSTM- RNN for the final prediction of affective state. Experimental results show that our proposed features and the DBLSTM- RNN based fusion framework obtain very promising results. On the development set, the obtained CCC is up to 0.824 for arousal and 0.688 for valence, and on the test set, the CCC is 0.747 for arousal and 0.609 for valence},

We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can sep-arate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an ar-bitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous well-known artworks.

abstract={Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy1–3, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)4,5 show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories6–11. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets12—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

title={Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer-Aided Detection: CNN Architectures, Dataset Characteristics and Transfer Learning},
abstract={Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and the revival of deep CNN. CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, layered hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, with 85{\%} sensitivity at 3 false positive per patient, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.},

The constructed classification model can then be used to predict the unknown class of a new pattern. While artificial neural networks are one of the most widely used models for pattern classification, their application is commonly restricted to fully connected three-layer topologies. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, ANN-Miner, which uses ACO to learn the structure of feed-forward neural networks. We report computational results on 40 benchmark datasets for several variations of the algorithm. Performance is compared to the standard three-layer structure trained with two different weight-learning algorithms (back propagation, and the ACOℝ algorithm), and also to a greedy algorithm for learning NN structures. A nonparametric Friedman test is used to determine statistical significance. In addition, we compare our proposed algorithm with NEAT, a prominent evolutionary algorithm for evolving neural networks, as well as three different well-known state-of-the-art classifiers, namely the C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm, the Ripper classification rule induction algorithm, and support vector machines.},

Traditional sentence-level sentiment classification research focuses on one-technique-fits-all solution or only centers on one special type of sentences. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which first classifies sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we find that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to first apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classification datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classification can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.},

abstract={Music genre recognition based on visual representation has been successfully explored over the last years. Classifiers trained with textural descriptors (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, and Gabor filters) extracted from the spectrograms have achieved state-of-the-art results on several music datasets. In this work, though, we argue that we can go further with the time-frequency analysis through the use of representation learning. To show that, we compare the results obtained with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the results obtained by using handcrafted features and SVM classifiers. In addition, we have performed experiments fusing the results obtained with learned features and handcrafted features to assess the complementarity between these representations for the music classification task. Experiments were conducted on three music databases with distinct characteristics, specifically a western music collection largely used in research benchmarks (ISMIR 2004 Database), a collection of Latin American music (LMD database), and a collection of field recordings of ethnic African music. Our experiments show that the CNN compares favorably to other classifiers in several scenarios, hence, it is a very interesting alternative for music genre recognition. Considering the African database, the CNN surpassed the handcrafted representations and also the state-of-the-art by a margin. In the case of the LMD database, the combination of CNN and Robust Local Binary Pattern achieved a recognition rate of 92{\%}, which to the best of our knowledge, is the best result (using an artist filter) on this dataset so far. On the ISMIR 2004 dataset, although the CNN did not improve the state of the art, it performed better than the classifiers based individually on other kind of features.},

abstract={Deep learning techniques for Sentiment Analysis have become very popular. They provide automatic feature extraction and both richer representation capabilities and better performance than traditional feature based techniques (i.e., surface methods). Traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. These long-established approaches can yield strong baselines, and their predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising deep learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of deep learning techniques integrating them with traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are sixfold. First, we develop a deep learning based sentiment classifier using a word embeddings model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on F1-Score.},

abstract={We present a novel technique to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines both global priors and local image features. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks, our deep network fea- tures a fusion layer that allows us to elegantly merge local information dependent on small image patches with global priors computed using the entire image. The entire framework, including the global and local priors as well as the colorization model, is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene classification data-base to train our model, exploiting the class labels of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the global priors. We validate our approach with a user study and compare against the state of the art, where we show significant improvements. Further- more, we demonstrate our method extensively on many different types of images, including black-and-white photography from over a hundred years ago, and show realistic colorizations.},

We introduce three improvements over previous research that lead to this state-of-the-art result. First, we show that training with a pixel-wise loss weighted by SSIM increases reconstruction quality according to several metrics. Second, we modify the recurrent architecture to improve spatial diffusion, which allows the network to more effectively capture and propagate image information through the network's hidden state. Finally, in addition to lossless entropy coding, we use a spatially adaptive bit allocation algorithm to more efficiently use the limited number of bits to encode visually complex image regions. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and Tecnick image sets and compare against standard codecs as well recently published methods based on deep neural networks.},

Each of the architectures we describe can provide variable compression rates during deployment without requiring retraining of the network: each network need only be trained once. All of our architectures consist of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoder and decoder, a binarizer, and a neural network for entropy coding. We compare RNN types (LSTM, associative LSTM) and introduce a new hybrid of GRU and ResNet. We also study "one-shot" versus additive reconstruction architectures and introduce a new scaled-additive framework. We compare to previous work, showing improvements of 4.3{\%}-8.8{\%} AUC (area under the rate-distortion curve), depending on the perceptual metric used. As far as we know, this is the first neural network architecture that is able to outperform JPEG at image compression across most bitrates on the rate-distortion curve on the Kodak dataset images, with and without the aid of entropy coding.},

abstract={The Recurrent Neural Networks and their vari-ants have shown promising performances in se-quence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extrac-tors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by fac-torizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained si-multaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using mul-tiple real-world video datasets and achieve com-petitive performances with state-of-the-art mod-els, even though our model architecture is or-ders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential data with RNN architec-tures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional sequential data.},

title={Scribbler: Controlling Deep Image Synthesis with Sketch and Color},
abstract={Recently, there have been several promising methods to generate realistic imagery from deep convolutional networks. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to 'scribble' over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach can generate more realistic, more diverse, and more controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.},

To achieve this, we propose the Sparse Category-Selective Objective Function (SCSOF) to modulate the neuron outputs of the top DCNN layer. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to any DCNN models. As ex-perimental results show, when applying the pro-posed method to the " Quick " model and NIN models, image classification performances are re-markably improved on four widely used bench-mark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST and SVHN, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.},

abstract={Realistic image manipulation is challenging because it requires modifying the image appearance in a user-controlled way, while preserving the realism of the result. Unless the user has considerable artistic skill, it is easy to "fall off" the manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we propose to learn the natural image manifold directly from data using a generative adversarial neural network. We then define a class of image editing operations, and constrain their output to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The model automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic as possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of constrained optimization and are applied in near-real time. We evaluate our algorithm on the task of realistic photo manipulation of shape and color. The presented method can further be used for changing one image to look like the other, as well as generating novel imagery from scratch based on user's scribbles.},

abstract={Objective functions for training of deep networks for face-related recognition tasks, such as facial expression recognition (FER), usually consider each sample independently. In this work, we present a novel peak-piloted deep network (PPDN) that uses a sample with peak expression (easy sample) to supervise the intermediate feature responses for a sample of non-peak expression (hard sample) of the same type and from the same subject. The expression evolving process from non-peak expression to peak expression can thus be implicitly embedded in the network to achieve the invariance to expression intensities. A special purpose back-propagation procedure, peak gradient suppression (PGS), is proposed for network training. It drives the intermediate-layer feature responses of non-peak expression samples towards those of the corresponding peak expression samples, while avoiding the inverse. This avoids degrading the recognition capability for samples of peak expression due to interference from their non-peak expression counterparts. Extensive comparisons on two popular FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and CK+, demonstrate the superiority of the PPDN over state-ofthe-art FER methods, as well as the advantages of both the network structure and the optimization strategy. Moreover, it is shown that PPDN is a general architecture, extensible to other tasks by proper definition of peak and non-peak samples. This is validated by experiments that show state-of-the-art performance on pose-invariant face recognition, using the Multi-PIE dataset.},

abstract={In this work we propose a novel interpretation of residual networks showing that they can be seen as a collection of many paths of differing length. Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.},

To predict the price indices of stock markets,we developed an architecturewhich combinedElman recurrent neural networkswith stochastic time effective function.By analyzing the proposedmodelwith the linear regression, complexity invariant distance (CID), andmultiscaleCID(MCID) analysis methods and taking themodel compared with differentmodels such as the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), the stochastic time effective neural network (STNN), and the Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN), the empirical results show that the proposed neural network displays the best performance among these neural networks in financial time series forecasting. Further, the empirical research is performed in testing the predictive effects of SSE, TWSE, KOSPI, and Nikkei225 with the established model, and the corresponding statistical comparisons of the above market indices are also exhibited. The experimental results show that this approach gives good performance in predicting the values fromthe stockmarket indices. 1.},

abstract={Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. This problem is clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied on significant user interaction or resulted in desaturated colorizations. We propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a "colorization Turing test," asking human participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools humans on 32{\%} of the trials, significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover, we show that colorization can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature learning, acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on several feature learning benchmarks.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel method to im-prove object recognition accuracies of convolu-tional neural networks (CNNs) by embedding the proposed Min-Max objective into a high layer of the models during the training process. The Min-Max objective explicitly enforces the learned object feature maps to have the minimum compactness for each object manifold and the maximum margin be-tween different object manifolds. The Min-Max objective can be universally applied to different CNN models with negligible additional computa-tion cost. Experiments with shallow and deep mod-els on four benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and MNIST demonstrate that CNN models trained with the Min-Max ob-jective achieve remarkable performance improve-ments compared to the corresponding baseline models.},

title={Automatic Drum Transcription Using Bi-Directional Recurrent Neural Networks},
abstract={Automatic drum transcription (ADT) systems attempt to generate a symbolic music notation for percussive in-struments in audio recordings. Neural networks have al-ready been shown to perform well in fields related to ADT such as source separation and onset detection due to their utilisation of time-series data in classification. We pro-pose the use of neural networks for ADT in order to ex-ploit their ability to capture a complex configuration of fea-tures associated with individual or combined drum classes. In this paper we present a bi-directional recurrent neu-ral network for offline detection of percussive onsets from specified drum classes and a recurrent neural network suit-able for online operation. In both systems, a separate net-work is trained to identify onsets for each drum class under observation—that is, kick drum, snare drum, hi-hats, and combinations thereof. We perform four evaluations utilis-ing the IDMT-SMT-Drums and ENST minus one datasets, which cover solo percussion and polyphonic audio respec-tively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-sented methods for solo percussion and a capacity for iden-tifying snare drums, which are historically the most diffi-cult drum class to detect.},

title={Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis},
abstract={A text-to-speech synthesis system typically consists of multiple stages, such as a text analysis frontend, an acoustic model and an audio synthesis module. Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given {\textless}text, audio{\textgreater} pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.},

This representation is disentangled with respect to transformations such as out-of-plane rotations and lighting variations. The DC-IGN model is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators and is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm. We propose a training procedure to encourage neurons in the graphics code layer to represent a specific transformation (e.g. pose or light). Given a single input image, our model can generate new images of the same object with variations in pose and lighting. We present qualitative and quantitative results of the model's efficacy at learning a 3D rendering engine.},

abstract={Deep neural network acoustic models produce substantial gains in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems. Emerging work with rectified linear (ReL) hidden units demonstrates additional gains in final system performance relative to more commonly used sigmoidal nonlinearities. In this work, we explore the use of deep rectifier networks as acoustic models for the 300 hour Switchboard conversational speech recognition task. Using simple training procedures without pretraining, networks with rectifier nonlinearities produce 2{\%} absolute reductions in word error rates over their sigmoidal counterparts. We analyze hidden layer representations to quantify differences in how ReL units encode inputs as compared to sigmoidal units. Finally, we evaluate a variant of the ReL unit with a gradient more amenable to optimization in an attempt to further improve deep rectifier networks.},

abstract={Single neuron models are typical functional replica of the biological neuron that are derived using their individual and group responses in networks. In recent past, a lot of work in this area has produced advanced neuron models for both analog and binary data patterns. Popular among these are the higher-order neurons, fuzzy neurons and other polynomial neurons. In this paper, we propose a new neuron model based on a polynomial architecture. Instead of considering all the higher-order terms, a simple aggregation function is used. The aggregation function is considered as a product of linear functions in different dimensions of the space. The functional mapping capability of the proposed neuron model is demonstrated through some well known time series prediction problems and is compared with the standard multilayer neural network. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In this paper, a drum transcription algorithm using partially fixed non-negative matrix factorization is presented. The proposed method allows users to identify percussive events in complex mixtures with a minimal training set. The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two parts: percussive part with pre-defined drum templates and harmonic part with undefined entries. The harmonic part is able to adapt to the music content, allowing the algorithm to work in polyphonic mixtures. Drum event times can be simply picked from the percussive activation matrix with onset detection. The system is efficient and robust even with a minimal training set. The recognition rates for the ENST dataset vary from 56.7 to 78.9{\%} for three percussive instruments extracted from polyphonic music.},

abstract={The ventral visual pathway implements object recognition and categorization in a hierarchy of processing areas with neuronal selectivities of increasing complexity. The presence of massive feedback connections within this hierarchy raises the possibility that normal visual processing relies on the use of computational loops. It is not known, however, whether object recognition can be performed at all without such loops (i.e., in a purely feed-forward mode). By analyzing the time course of reaction times in a masked natural scene categorization paradigm, we show that the human visual system can generate selective motor responses based on a single feed-forward pass. We confirm these results using a more constrained letter discrimination task, in which the rapid succession of a target and mask is actually perceived as a distractor. We show that a masked stimulus presented for only 26 msecand often not consciously perceivedcan fully determine the earliest selective motor responses: The neural representations of the stimulus and mask are thus kept separated during a short period corresponding to the feedforward sweep. Therefore, feedback loops do not appear to be mandatory for visual processing. Rather, we found that such loops allow the masked stimulus to reverberate in the visual system and affect behavior for nearly 150 msec after the feed-forward sweep.},

abstract={Single neuron models are typical functional replica of the biological neuron that are derived using their individual and group responses in networks. In recent past, a lot of work in this area has produced advanced neuron models for both analog and binary data patterns. Popular among these are the higher-order neurons, fuzzy neurons and other polynomial neurons. In this paper, we propose a new neuron model based on a polynomial architecture. Instead of considering all the higher-order terms, a simple aggregation function is used. The aggregation function is considered as a product of linear functions in different dimensions of the space. The functional mapping capability of the proposed neuron model is demonstrated through some well known time series prediction problems and is compared with the standard multilayer neural network. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin.

Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given {\textless}text, audio{\textgreater} pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.},

title={Compositional pattern producing networks: A novel abstraction of development},
pages={131--162},
abstract={Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

abstract={Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has remained a challenging and interesting problem. Despite efforts made in developing various methods for FER, existing approaches traditionally lack generalizability when applied to unseen images or those that are captured in wild setting. Most of the existing approaches are based on engineered features (e.g. HOG, LBPH, and Gabor) where the classifier's hyperparameters are tuned to give best recognition accuracies across a single database, or a small collection of similar databases. Nevertheless, the results are not significant when they are applied to novel data. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture to address the FER problem across multiple well-known standard face datasets. Specifically, our network consists of two convolutional layers each followed by max pooling and then four Inception layers. The network is a single component architecture that takes registered facial images as the input and classifies them into either of the six basic or the neutral expressions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on seven publically available facial expression databases, viz. MultiPIE, MMI, CK+, DISFA, FERA, SFEW, and FER2013. The results of proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods and better than traditional convolutional neural networks and in both accuracy and training time.},

The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

abstract={Despite the success of CNNs, selecting the optimal architecture for a given task remains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture, we propose a "fabric" that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size. We present benchmark results competitive with the state of the art for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR10, and for semantic segmentation on the Part Labels dataset.},

We introduce Monte Carlo crogging which combines bootstrapping and cross-validation (CV) in a single approach through repeated random splitting of the original time series into mutually exclusive datasets for training. As the training/validation split is independent of the number of folds, the algorithm offers more flexibility in the size, and number of training samples compared to k-fold cross-validation. The study also provides for crogging and bagging: (1) the first systematic evaluation across time series length and combination size, (2) a bias and variance decomposition of the forecast errors to understand improvement gains, and (3) a comparison to established benchmarks of model averaging and selection. Crogging can easily be extended to other autoregressive models. Results on real and simulated series demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy especially for short time series and long forecast horizons.},

Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state-of-the-art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding and end-to-end learning. Towards this goal, we first provide a taxonomy to classify each approach and then analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarking datasets including KITTI, ISPRS, MOT and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges.

abstract={One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), rea- soning, intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, withmin- imal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally lim- ited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very ineffi- cient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Sec- ond, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learn- ing) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more ab- stract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence. 1},

A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks--their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits--but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.},

abstract={The Recurrent Neural Networks and their vari-ants have shown promising performances in se-quence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extrac-tors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by fac-torizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained si-multaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using mul-tiple real-world video datasets and achieve com-petitive performances with state-of-the-art mod-els, even though our model architecture is or-ders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential data with RNN architec-tures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional sequential data.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

abstract={Deep learning techniques for Sentiment Analysis have become very popular. They provide automatic feature extraction and both richer representation capabilities and better performance than traditional feature based techniques (i.e., surface methods). Traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. These long-established approaches can yield strong baselines, and their predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising deep learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of deep learning techniques integrating them with traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are sixfold. First, we develop a deep learning based sentiment classifier using a word embeddings model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on F1-Score.},

abstract={Fundamental developments in feedforward artificial neural networks from the past thirty years are reviewed. The history, origination, operating characteristics, and basic theory of several supervised neural-network training algorithms (including the perceptron rule, the least-mean-square algorithm, three Madaline rules, and the backpropagation technique) are described. The concept underlying these iterative adaptation algorithms is the minimal disturbance principle, which suggests that during training it is advisable to inject new information into a network in a manner that disturbs stored information to the smallest extent possible. The two principal kinds of online rules that have developed for altering the weights of a network are examined for both single-threshold elements and multielement networks. They are error-correction rules, which alter the weights of a network to correct error in the output response to the present input pattern, and gradient rules, which alter the weights of a network during each pattern presentation by gradient descent with the objective of reducing mean-square error (averaged over all training patterns)},

abstract={We present a new self-organizing neural network model that has two variants. The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches (e.g., the Kohonen feature map) is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process that also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method that results from the combination of the above-mentioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible—in contrast to earlier approaches—to perform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks that generalize very well. Results on the two-spirals benchmark and a vowel classification problem are presented that are better than any results previously published.},

abstract={With the emergence of online social networks, the social network-based recommendation approach is popularly used. The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a joint segmenta- tion and classification framework for sen- timent analysis. Existing sentiment clas- sification algorithms typically split a sen- tence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent senti- ment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as “not bad” and “a great deal of ”. We address this issue by developing a joint segmentation and classification framework (JSC), which si- multaneously conducts sentence segmen- tation and sentence-level sentiment classi- fication. Specifically, we use a log-linear model to score each segmentation candi- date, and exploit the phrasal information of top-ranked segmentations as features to build the sentiment classifier. A marginal log-likelihood objective function is de- vised for the segmentation model, which is optimized for enhancing the sentiment classification performance. The joint mod- el is trained only based on the annotat- ed sentiment polarity of sentences, with- out any segmentation annotations. Experi- ments on a benchmark Twitter sentimen- t classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that, our joint model performs com- parably with the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Different types of sentences express sentiment in very different ways. Traditional sentence-level sentiment classification research focuses on one-technique-fits-all solution or only centers on one special type of sentences. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which first classifies sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we find that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to first apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classification datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classification can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.},

abstract={— Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parame-ters are randomly generated and the output weights are analyti-cally computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via 1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.

This can be challenging when the underlying model of the data is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimizing neural network architecture using genetic programming as a machine learning strategy would improve the ability of neural networks to model and detect nonlinear interactions among genes in studies of common human diseases. RESULTS: Using simulated data, we show that a genetic programming optimized neural network approach is able to model gene-gene interactions as well as a traditional back propagation neural network. Furthermore, the genetic programming optimized neural network is better than the traditional back propagation neural network approach in terms of predictive ability and power to detect gene-gene interactions when non-functional polymorphisms are present. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a machine learning strategy for optimizing neural network architecture may be preferable to traditional trial-and-error approaches for the identification and characterization of gene-gene interactions in common, complex human diseases.},

abstract={Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and the revival of deep CNN. CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, layered hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, with 85{\%} sensitivity at 3 false positive per patient, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.},

In this paper we present the Inside-Outside Net (ION), an object detector that exploits information both inside and outside the region of interest. Contextual information outside the region of interest is integrated using spatial recurrent neural networks. Inside, we use skip pooling to extract information at multiple scales and levels of abstraction. Through extensive experiments we evaluate the design space and provide readers with an overview of what tricks of the trade are important. ION improves state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2012 object detection from 73.9{\%} to 76.4{\%} mAP.

abstract={Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract={Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

abstract={Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

We introduce three improvements over previous research that lead to this state-of-the-art result. First, we show that training with a pixel-wise loss weighted by SSIM increases reconstruction quality according to several metrics. Second, we modify the recurrent architecture to improve spatial diffusion, which allows the network to more effectively capture and propagate image information through the network's hidden state. Finally, in addition to lossless entropy coding, we use a spatially adaptive bit allocation algorithm to more efficiently use the limited number of bits to encode visually complex image regions.

The entire framework, including the global and local priors as well as the colorization model, is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene classification data-base to train our model, exploiting the class labels of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the global priors. We validate our approach with a user study and compare against the state of the art, where we show significant improvements. Further- more, we demonstrate our method extensively on many different types of images, including black-and-white photography from over a hundred years ago, and show realistic colorizations.},

abstract={Network in Netwrok (NiN) is an effective instance and an important extension of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers. Instead of using a linear filter for convolution, NiN utilizes shallow MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), a nonlinear function, to replace the linear filter. Because of the powerfulness of MLP and {\$} 1\backslashtimes 1 {\$} convolutions in spatial domain, NiN has stronger ability of feature representation and hence results in better recognition rate. However, MLP itself consists of fully connected layers which give rise to a large number of parameters. In this paper, we propose to replace dense shallow MLP with sparse shallow MLP. One or more layers of the sparse shallow MLP are sparely connected in the channel dimension or channel-spatial domain. The proposed method is implemented by applying unshared convolution across the channel dimension and applying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational layers. The proposed method is called CiC. Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset, augmented CIFAR10 dataset, and CIFAR100 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CiC method.},

title={Variable Rate Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Networks},
year={2015},
abstract={A large fraction of Internet traffic is now driven by requests from mobile devices with relatively small screens and often stringent bandwidth requirements. Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will significantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional LSTM recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efficient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}32 thumbnails, our LSTM-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) JPEG, JPEG2000 and WebP, with a storage size that is reduced by 10{\%} or more.},

abstract={We describe an image compression method, consisting of a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.},

One dimension specifies the type of task performed by the algorithm: preprocessing, data reduction/feature extraction, segmentation, object recognition, image understanding and optimisation. The other dimension captures the abstraction level of the input data processed by the algorithm: pixel-level, local feature-level, structure-level, object-level, object-set-level and scene characterisation.

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

In particular, we consider the range-limited approximation of linking by intermediations in a few hops, and show the strong robustness in the growth without degrading efficiency of paths. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tolerance of connectivity is reformable even from extremely vulnerable real networks according to our proposed growing process with some investment.

abstract={We consider the task of dimensional emotion recognition on video data using deep learning. While several previous methods have shown the benefits of training temporal neural network models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on hand-crafted features, few works have considered combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with RNNs. In this work, we present a system that performs emotion recognition on video data using both CNNs and RNNs, and we also analyze how much each neural network component contributes to the system's overall performance. We present our findings on videos from the Audio/Visual+Emotion Challenge (AV+EC2015). In our experiments, we analyze the effects of several hyperparameters on overall performance while also achieving superior performance to the baseline and other competing methods.},

abstract={This paper describes the learning and control capabilities of a biologically constrained bottom-up model of the mammalian cerebellum. Results are presented from six tasks: 1) eyelid conditioning; 2) pendulum balancing; 3) proportional-integral-derivative control; 4) robot balancing; 5) pattern recognition; and 6) MNIST handwritten digit recognition. These tasks span several paradigms of machine learning, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, control, and pattern recognition. Results over these six domains indicate that the cerebellar simulation is capable of robustly identifying static input patterns even when randomized across the sensory apparatus. This capability allows the simulated cerebellum to perform several different supervised learning and control tasks. On the other hand, both reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition prove problematic due to the delayed nature of error signals and the simulator's inability to solve the credit assignment problem. These results are consistent with previous findings which hypothesize that in the human brain, the basal ganglia is responsible for reinforcement learning, while the cerebellum handles supervised learning.},

abstract={Feature selection is used in many application areas relevant to expert and intelligent systems, such as data mining and machine learning, image processing, anomaly detection, bioinformatics and natural language processing. Feature selection based on information theory is a popular approach due its computational efficiency, scalability in terms of the dataset dimensionality, and independence from the classifier. Common drawbacks of this approach are the lack of information about the interaction between the features and the classifier, and the selection of redundant and irrelevant features. The latter is due to the limitations of the employed goal functions leading to overestimation of the feature significance. To address this problem, this article introduces two new nonlinear feature selection methods, namely Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) and Normalised Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (NJMIM); both these methods use mutual information and the 'maximum of the minimum' criterion, which alleviates the problem of overestimation of the feature significance as demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The proposed methods are compared using eleven publically available datasets with five competing methods. The results demonstrate that the JMIM method outperforms the other methods on most tested public datasets, reducing the relative average classification error by almost 6{\%} in comparison to the next best performing method. The statistical significance of the results is confirmed by the ANOVA test. Moreover, this method produces the best trade-off between accuracy and stability.},

title={On the importance of normalisation layers in deep learning with piecewise linear activation units},
author={Liao, Zhibin and Carneiro, Gustavo},
abstract={Deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations are currently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets. The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activation functions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with the use of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classification of similar input examples. During the training process, these subnetworks avoid overfitting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they must share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we have made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance of such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial distribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear activation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear activation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can result in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions. Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial distribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the introduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these activation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with a relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch normalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models. We show that by introducing maxout and batch normalisation units to the network in network model results in a model that produces classification results that are better than or comparable to the current state of the art in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets.},

abstract={Abstract—The emergent machine learning technique - Ex- treme Learning Machines (ELMs) - has become a hot area of research over the past years, which is attributed to the growing research activities and significant contributions made by numerous researchers around the world. Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that i) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes / neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes / neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; ii) ELM is proposed for both generalized single hidden layer feedfoward network and multi hidden layers feedforward networks; iii) Homogeneous architecture based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary / multi- class) classification. iv) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi layers of networks either.},

The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language model. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We perform two sets of experiments. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and also investigate the effect of combining acoustic and music language model predictions using the proposed architecture. We compare performance of the neural network based acoustic models with two popular unsupervised acoustic models. Results show that convolutional neural network acoustic models yields the best performance across all evaluation metrics. We also observe improved performance with the application of the music language models. Finally, we present an efficient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications.},

abstract={Automatic drum transcription (ADT) systems attempt to generate a symbolic music notation for percussive in-struments in audio recordings. Neural networks have al-ready been shown to perform well in fields related to ADT such as source separation and onset detection due to their utilisation of time-series data in classification. We pro-pose the use of neural networks for ADT in order to ex-ploit their ability to capture a complex configuration of fea-tures associated with individual or combined drum classes. In this paper we present a bi-directional recurrent neu-ral network for offline detection of percussive onsets from specified drum classes and a recurrent neural network suit-able for online operation. In both systems, a separate net-work is trained to identify onsets for each drum class under observation—that is, kick drum, snare drum, hi-hats, and combinations thereof. We perform four evaluations utilis-ing the IDMT-SMT-Drums and ENST minus one datasets, which cover solo percussion and polyphonic audio respec-tively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-sented methods for solo percussion and a capacity for iden-tifying snare drums, which are historically the most diffi-cult drum class to detect.},

abstract={Extreme learning machine (ELM), as a new learning framework, draws increasing attractions in the areas of large-scale computing, high-speed signal processing, artificial intelligence, and so on. ELM aims to break the barriers between the conventional artificial learning techniques and biological learning mechanism and represents a suite of machine learning techniques in which hidden neurons need not to be tuned. ELM theories and algorithms argue that “random hidden neurons” capture the essence of some brain learning mechanisms as well as the intuitive sense that the efficiency of brain learning need not rely on computing power of neurons. Thus, compared with traditional neural networks and support vector machine, ELM offers significant advantages such as fast learning speed, ease of implementation, and minimal human intervention. Due to its remarkable generalization performance and implementation efficiency, ELM has been applied in various applications. In this paper, we first provide an overview of newly derived ELM theories and approaches. On the other hand, with the ongoing development of multilayer feature representation, some new trends on ELM-based hierarchical learning are discussed. Moreover, we also present several interesting ELM applications to showcase the practical advances on this subject.},

abstract={Nowadays, virtually no companies innovate alone. Firms team up with a variety of partners, in a wide number of ways, to create new technologies, products, and services. But what is the best way to leverage the power of outsiders? To help executives answer that question, Pisano, of Harvard Business School, and Verganti, of Politecnico di Milano, developed a simple framework focused on two questions: Given your strategy, how open or closed should your network of collaborators be? And who should decide which problems to tackle and which solutions to adopt? There are four basic modes of collaboration, say the authors. An elite circle is a closed network with a hierarchical governance: One company selects the participants, defines the problem, and chooses the solution. For instance, Alessi, an Italian home-products company, invited 200 outside experts in postmodern architecture to contribute ideas for new home-product designs. An innovation mall is hierarchical but open: Anyone can post a problem or propose solutions in it, but the company posting the problem chooses the solution. An example is InnoCentive.com, an eBay-like site where companies post scientific challenges. An innovation community is open and decentralized: Anyone can propose problems, offer solutions, and decide which ideas to use -- as happens in the Linux open-source software community. A consortium is a private group of participants that operate as equals and jointly select problems, decide how to conduct work, and choose solutions. IBM has set up a number of consortia with other companies to develop next-generation semiconductor technologies. No one approach is superior; each involves strategic trade-offs. When choosing among modes, firms must weigh their advantages and challenges, and assess which will work best with their strategy, capabilities, structure, and assets.

year={2006},
abstract={Research has shown that many innovations originate not in the manufacturer but the user domain. Internet-based toolkits for idea competitions (TIC) are a novel way for manufacturers to access innovative ideas and solutions from users. Idea competitions build on the nature of competition as a means to encourage users to participate at an open innovation process, to inspire their creativity, and to increase the quality of the submissions. When the contest ends, submissions are evaluated by an expert panel. Users whose submissions score highest receive an award from the manufacturer, which is often granted in exchange for the right to exploit the solution in its domain. Following the idea of evolutionary prototyping, we developed a TIC in cooperation with a manufacturer of sports goods. The TIC was launched as a pilot in one of the company's markets. Submissions were evaluated using the consensual assessment technique. The evaluation of this study provides suggestions for further research, but also implications for managers willing to explore TIC in their organization.},

journal={Journal of Product Innovation Management},
issn={07376782},
volume={29},
abstract={Generating ideas for new products used to be the exclusive domain of marketers, engineers, and/or designers. Users have only recently been recognized as an alternative source of new product ideas. Whereas some have attributed great potential to outsourcing idea generation to the “crowd” of users (“crowdsourcing”), others have clearly been more skeptical. The authors join this debate by presenting a real-world comparison of ideas actually generated by a firm's professionals with those generated by users in the course of an idea generation contest. Both professionals and users provided ideas to solve an effective and relevant problem in the consumer goods market for baby products. Executives from the underlying company evaluated all ideas (blind to their source) in terms of key quality dimensions including novelty, customer benefit, and feasibility. The study reveals that the crowdsourcing process generated user ideas that score significantly higher in terms of novelty and customer benefit, and somewhat lower in terms of feasibility. However, the average values for feasibility—in sharp contrast to novelty and customer benefit—tended to be relatively high overall, meaning that feasibility did not constitute a narrow bottleneck in this study. Even more interestingly, it is found that user ideas are placed more frequently than expected among the very best in terms of novelty and customer benefit. These findings, which are quite counterintuitive from the perspective of classic new product development (NPD) literature, suggest that, at least under certain conditions, crowdsourcing might constitute a promising method to gather user ideas that can complement those of a firm's professionals at the idea generation stage in NPD.},

abstract={This paper reviews the literature on the problem of information overload, with particular reference to business organisations. The literature reveals that although the problem of information overload has existed for many years, in recent years the problem has become more widely recognised and experienced. Both perceptions and the actual effects of information overload have been exacerbated by the rapid advances made in information and communication technology, although it is not clear cut as to whether the Internet has worsened or improved the situation. A theme stressed in the literature is the paradoxical situation that, although there is an abundance of information available, it is often difficult to obtain useful, relevant information when it is needed. Some solutions put forward to reduce information overload are: a reduction in the duplication of information found in the professional literature; the adoption of personal information management strategies, together with the integration of software solutions such as push technology and intelligent agents; and the provision of value-added information (filtered by software or information specialists). An emphasis is placed on technology as a tool and not the driver, while increased information literacy may provide the key to reducing information overload.},

By emphasising the importance of design for the definition of consumers׳ needs, the restructuring of firms׳ organisational structures and strategies, and the evolution of firms׳ value creation processes, this review paper identifies relevant research gaps and questions that would benefit from future scholarly attention. In particular, it is suggested that such effort should address the analysis of how design consumption can help better comprehend consumers׳ needs; what are the implications of design thinking on the skill sets of design professionals; the organisational structure of firms, including the reconfiguration of other business functions, and their strategy; and whether and how design thinking can shape firms׳ value creation processes and contribute to the formalisation of design tasks.},

Thus, this study presents a CAD system for shoe-last rapid customized design based on the piecewise reconstruction to realize the interactive deformation and separate/global shoe-last form reuse. First, piecewise remodeling method is proposed based on the multi-layer parametric definition and contour curves are extracted from the mesh. Then, five types of proper constraints to support surface manipulation are proposed, and the draft-driven deformation by the contour curve bending can realize the interactive local surface design in free angle of view. Finally, shoe-last styles can be saved and reused globally or separately to share design results between different shoe-lasts. Experimental examples show that customized shoe-lasts can be easily and rapidly generated by adopting the parametric design methods.},

abstract={This paper presents a psychological contract perspective on the use of the open source development model as a global sourcing strategy -- opensourcing, as the authors termed it -- whereby commercial companies and open source communities collaborate on development of software of commercial interest to the company. Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness. The study reveals an ongoing shift from open source software (OSS) as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises.},

We describe this case study, and how this became a location to articulate and explore four integrated dimensions of responsible innovation: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness.

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze the emerging crowd-funding phenomenon, that is a collective effort by consumers who network and pool their money together, usually via the internet, in order to invest in and support efforts initiated by other people or organizations. Successful service businesses that organize crowd-funding and act as intermediaries are emerging, attesting to the viability of this means of attracting investment. Design/methodology/approach – The research employs a “grounded theory” approach, performing an in-depth qualitative analysis of three cases involving crowd-funding initiatives: SellaBand in the music business, Trampoline in financial services, and Kapipal in non-profit services. These cases were selected to represent a diverse set of crowd-funding operations that vary in terms of risk/return for the investor and the type of payoff associated to the investment. Findings – The research addresses two research questions: how and why do consumers turn into crowd-funding participants? and how and why do service providers set up a crowd-funding initiative? Concerning the first research question, the authors' findings reveal purposes, characteristics, roles and tasks, and investment size of crowd-funding activity from the consumer's point of view. Regarding the second research question, the authors' analysis reveals purposes, service roles, and network effects of crowd-funding activity investigated from the point of view of the service organization that set up the initiative. Practical implications – The findings also have implications for service managers interested in launching and/or managing crowd-funding initiatives. Originality/value – The paper addresses an emerging phenomenon and contributes to service theory in terms of extending the consumer's role from co-production and co-creation to investment.},

abstract={Although an abundance of academic literature positions organizational information processing as antecedent to decision making, little attention is paid to the possibility that decision making can be antecedent to certain elements of organizational information processing. Specifically, does the decision making process impact the type of organizational learning that takes place? Do different approaches to decision making alter the amount and variety of information made available to the organization, that is, the level of information overload? This paper examines incremental and comprehensive decision making to understand the effects of different decision making types on organizational learning and information overload. Incrementalism suggests that decision making should take place in small steps or increments. This approach analyzes only a few scenarios to make decisions resulting in few, if any, major organizational changes. However, comprehensive decision making requires the consideration of all possible scenarios and potential outcomes, resulting in a major overhaul of traditions and procedures within the organization. Consequently, each decision making approach has a different impact on organizational learning and information overload. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

title={Cross-Cultural Creativity: Conceptualization and propositions for global new product development},
abstract={In today's global business environment, where multinational companies are pressed to increase revenues in order to survive, creativity may hold the key to ensuring their new product development (NPD) efforts lead to innovations with worldwide appeal, such as Apple's iPad and Gillette's Fusion Razor. To leverage creativity for effective global NPD, businesses want to know how cultures differ in their concepts of creativity and the impact of those differences on approaches to developing new products. Because global new products are increasingly developed in, by, and for multiple cultures, a particular need is for a culturally reflective understanding, or conceptualization, of creativity. While creativity is believed to be culturally tied, the dominant framework of creativity used in business and management assumes that creativity is culturally indifferent or insensitive. This knowledge gap is addressed by studying the role of creativity in NPD practices in a cross-cultural or global context. The study begins by first developing a culturally anchored conceptualization of creativity. Called cross-cultural creativity, the concept draws on creativity insights from the field of art and aesthetics. The concept specifies two modes of creativity, neither of which is superior to the other, called the spontaneous or S route and the divergent or D route. The S route emphasizes adaptiveness, processes, intuitiveness, and metamorphism, while the D route focuses on disruptiveness, results, rationality, and literalism. Next, this new concept is applied to NPD by positing how creativity in distinct cultures may shape NPD practices, as illustrated by Japanese and U.S. firms. Research propositions are formulated to capture these patterns, and thereafter, theoretical and practical implications of the framework and propositions are discussed. The implications center on global NPD, which is a complex enterprise involving typically more than one culture to design and develop new products for several geographic markets. The study is of interest to researchers needing a globally situated, culturally attached framework of creativity for international NPD studies, and managers seeking to exploit creativity in multinational and multicultural innovation projects.},

title={Deep mixture density networks for acoustic modeling in statistical parametric speech synthesis},
location={Florence, Italy},
abstract={Statistical parametric speech synthesis ({SPSS}) using deep neural networks ({DNNs}) has shown its potential to produce naturally-sounding synthesized speech. However, there are limitations in the current implementation of {DNN}-based acoustic modeling for speech synthesis, such as the unimodal nature of its objective function and its lack of ability to predict variances. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the use of a mixture density output layer. It can estimate full probability density functions over real-valued output features conditioned on the corresponding input features. Experimental results in objective and subjective evaluations show that the use of the mixture density output layer improves the prediction accuracy of acoustic features and the naturalness of the synthesized speech.},

abstract={We provide an overview of a current research project on measuring, modeling, and virtually recreating the sound radiation characteristics of real acoustic violins. Our general approach is based on measuring the directivity of an acoustic violin, and designing a digital ﬁlter structure that mimics the observed directivity while allowing interactive operation. The digital ﬁlter structure is fed by the electrical signal coming from a silent electric violin as played by a musician. In a hemi-anechoic chamber, we use a microphone array to characterize the frequency-dependent directivity transfer function of a real violin by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the acoustic pressure at 4320 points on a sphere surrounding the instrument. From the input force and output pressure signals obtained from the real violin measurements, we use deconvolution to estimate 4320 impulse responses each corresponding to a radiation direction. With such impulse responses, we use State Wave Synthesis to model the observed directivity in time-varying conditions and efﬁciently render directional wavefronts in a virtual environment. We characterize the silent violin transfer function by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the electrical signal at its output, leading to an impulse response that we use to design an inverse ﬁlter to recover the force excitation at the bridge.},

title={A big data approach to acoustic model training corpus selection},
author={Kapralova, Olga and Alex, John and Weinstein, Eugene and Moreno, Pedro and Siohan, Olivier},
abstract={Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have recently become the state of the art technology in speech recognition systems. In this paper we propose a new approach to constructing large high quality unsupervised sets to train {DNN} models for large vocabulary speech recognition. The core of our technique consists of two steps. We ﬁrst redecode speech logged by our production recognizer with a very accurate (and hence too slow for real-time usage) set of speech models to improve the quality of ground truth transcripts used for training alignments. Using conﬁdence scores, transcript length and transcript ﬂattening heuristics designed to cull salient utterances from three decades of speech per language, we then carefully select training data sets consisting of up to 15K hours of speech to be used to train acoustic models without any reliance on manual transcription. We show that this approach yields models with approximately 18K context dependent states that achieve 10\% relative improvement in large vocabulary dictation and voice-search systems for Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian and Russian languages.},

abstract={In this paper we investigate the problem of locating singing voice in music tracks. As opposed to most existing methods for this task, we rely on the extraction of the characteristics speciﬁc to singing voice. In our approach we suppose that the singing voice is characterized by harmonicity, formants, vibrato and tremolo. In the present study we deal only with the vibrato and tremolo characteristics. For this, we ﬁrst extract sinusoidal partials from the musical audio signal . The frequency modulation (vibrato) and amplitude modulation (tremolo) of each partial are then studied to determine if the partial corresponds to singing voice and hence the corresponding segment is supposed to contain singing voice. For this we estimate for each partial the rate (frequency of the modulations) and the extent (amplitude of modulation) of both vibrato and tremolo. A partial selection is then operated based on these values. A second criteria based on harmonicity is also introduced. Based on this, each segment can be labelled as singing or non-singing. Post-processing of the segmentation is then applied in order to remove short-duration segments. The proposed method is then evaluated on a large manually annotated test-set. The results of this evaluation are compared to the one obtained with a usual machine learning approach ({MFCC} and {SFM} modeling with {GMM}). The proposed method achieves very close results to the machine learning approach : 76.8\% compared to 77.4\% F-measure (frame classiﬁcation). This result is very promising, since both approaches are orthogonal and can then be combined.},

title={Singing-voice separation from monaural recordings using robust principal component analysis},
location={Kyoto, Japan},
date={2012-03},
abstract={Separating singing voices from music accompaniment is an important task in many applications, such as music information retrieval, lyric recognition and alignment. Music accompaniment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace, because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method. Evaluations on the {MIR}-1K dataset show that this method can achieve around 1∼1.4 {dB} higher {GNSDR} compared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior training or requiring particular features.},
