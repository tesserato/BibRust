abstract = {In the networked world, firms are recognizing the power of the Internet as a platform for co-creating value with customers. We focus on how the Internet has impacted the process of collaborative innovation - a key process in value co-creation. We outline the distinctive capabilities of the Internet as a platform for customer engagement, including interactivity, enhanced reach, persistence, speed, and flexibility, and suggest that firms can use these capabilities to engage customers in collaborative product innovation through a variety of Internet-based mechanisms. We discuss how these mechanisms can facilitate collaborative innovation at different stages of the New Product Development process (back end vs. front end stages) and for differing levels of customer involvement (high reach vs. high richness). We present two detailed exploratory case studies to illustrate the integrated and systematic usage of Internet-based collaborative innovation mechanisms - Ducati from the motorbike industry and Eli Lilly from the pharmaceutical industry. We derive implications for managerial practice and academic research on collaborative innovation. \textcopyright 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.},

This model has many desirable properties, in particular that it can be written as a well-posed initial-boundary value problem (permitting stable finite difference schemes) and that it may be directly related to a digital waveguide model, a digital filter-based algorithm which can be used for musical sound synthesis. Techniques for the extraction of model parameters from experimental data over the full range of the grand piano are discussed, as is the link between the model parameters and the filter responses in a digital waveguide. Simulations are performed. Finally, the waveguide model is extended to the case of several coupled strings.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods have resulted in significant performance improvements in several application domains and as such several software frameworks have been developed to facilitate their implementation. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning frameworks, namely Caffe, Neon, TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch, on three aspects: extensibility, hardware utilization, and speed. The study is performed on several types of deep learning architectures and we evaluate the performance of the above frameworks when employed on a single machine for both (multi-threaded) CPU and GPU (Nvidia Titan X) settings. The speed performance metrics used here include the gradient computation time, which is important during the training phase of deep networks, and the forward time, which is important from the deployment perspective of trained networks. For convolutional networks, we also report how each of these frameworks support various convolutional algorithms and their corresponding performance. From our experiments, we observe that Theano and Torch are the most easily extensible frameworks. We observe that Torch is best suited for any deep architecture on CPU, followed by Theano. It also achieves the best performance on the GPU for large convolutional and fully connected networks, followed closely by Neon. Theano achieves the best performance on GPU for training and deployment of LSTM networks. Caffe is the easiest for evaluating the performance of standard deep architectures. Finally, TensorFlow is a very flexible framework, similar to Theano, but its performance is currently not competitive compared to the other studied frameworks.},

abstract = {The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has proven to be an effective model for producing semantically meaningful latent representations for natural data. However, it has thus far seen limited application to sequential data, and, as we demonstrate, existing recurrent VAE models have difficulty modeling sequences with long-term structure. To address this issue, we propose the use of a hierarchical decoder, which first outputs embeddings for subsequences of the input and then uses these embeddings to generate each subsequence independently. This structure encourages the model to utilize its latent code, thereby avoiding the "posterior collapse" problem which remains an issue for recurrent VAEs. We apply this architecture to modeling sequences of musical notes and find that it exhibits dramatically better sampling, interpolation, and reconstruction performance than a "flat" baseline model. An implementation of our "MusicVAE" is available online.2.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we discuss creative destruction theory. This is defined as the process by which information and communication technology destroys previous technological solutions and lays waste old companies in order to make room for the new companies. One may think about the creative destruction in recent times, where searches were previously done through sites such as "HotBot, Ananzi Excite, WebCrawler, Ask Jeeves, Ask.com, Yahoo, Dogpile, AltaVista, Lycos, MSN Search, Bing, AOL Search, Infoseek, Go.com, Netscape, MetaCrawler" (Schwartz in A look back at the old search engines, 2009.), all which have been replaced by Google. Google is the largest search engine today. Large amounts of data brought about the advent of Internet of Things can mean that there are plenty insights that companies that were affected by the gayle of destruction rarely knew it existed. Companies in the coalface would have had enormous data of people that use it; we think that with the AI-powered analytics, the idea of creative destruction as espoused by Schumpeter (1942) would hold as far as technology is concerned. However, companies that would be pioneers of the time may not necessarily fold and close doors. With regard to the impact of AI to the creative destruction theory, our view is that since data is the new gold, we think that companies that take advantage of AI for the purpose of advanced data analytics would be able to deploy this for the purpose of analysing large amounts of data brought about by the advent of the Internet of Things. Our hypothesis is that the above can only mean that there are plenty of insights for those companies in the coalface; the gayle of destruction in this regard will not bring about new entrepreneurs or new companies but the same companies and insights from data, and predictive analytics will show them which technology is to be destroyed and what it needs to be replaced with. Whatever the replacement will be, it will be based on troves of data, which allows these companies and gives them the competitive advantage to understand their market and where their market is headed.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

abstract = {A frequently encountered problem in many branches of science involves the resolution of experimental data into a sum of independent exponential curves of the form f(t)=∑ni=1Niexp(- $\lambda$it), i-l in order to estimate the physically significant parameters Ni and X,-. Such problems arise, for example, in the analysis of multicomponent radioactive decay curves, and in the study of the dielectric properties of certain compounds. This paper is concerned with the numerical evaluation of a mathematical approach to the problem. The approach is based on the inversion of the Laplace integral equation by a method of Fourier transforms. The results of the analysis appear in the form of a frequency spectrum. Each true peak in the spectrum indicates a component, the abscissa value at the center of the peak is the decay constant X,-, while the height of the peak is directly proportional to Ni/$\lambda$t. Results obtained on an IBM 650 computer indicate that the method may possess certain advantages over previous methods of analysis.},

abstract = {In exploring alternative futures, strategic planners are frequently forced into making simplifying assumptions because of time and methodological limitations. These assumptions typically reduce the interdisciplinary perspective, limit the range of policy choices, and restrict the investigation to only the "most likely" future changes. By so doing, many sources of future surprise are eliminated from the analysis. This article describes INTERAX, a method for generating alternative future scenarios which requires very few simplifying assumptions. To accelerate the time required for the analysis, INTERAX includes a large multidisciplinary data base, which is of immediate use in a broad range of long-range strategic issues. INTERAX is described in two parts. The previous issue of Technological Forecasting and Social Change contained a description of the method and its philosophy and presented the data base. This article describes how INTERAX generates scenarios and uses them in exploring a variety of strategic issues. \textcopyright1980.},

@article{1983McintyreOscillations,
author = {M E McIntyre and R T Schumacher and J Woodhouse},
abstract = {The time-domain description of musical and other nonlinear oscillators complements the more commonly used frequency-domain description, and is advantageous for some purposes. It is especially advantageous when studying large-amplitude oscillations, for which nonlinearity may be severe. It gives direct insight into the physical reasons for the variation of waveform as playing conditions vary, and into certain phenomena which may seem counter-intuitive from the frequency-domain viewpoint, such as the musically undesirable flattening in the pitch of a bowed string when the bow is pressed too hard onto the string. It is easy to set up efficient time-domain simulations on a small computer, a fact that has been surprisingly little exploited in musical acoustics. The simplest relevant model is described here. It demonstrates some of the basic nonlinear behavior of the clarinet, violin, and flute families with very little programming effort. Remarkably, a single set of model equations has relevance to all three cases, at a certain level of idealization, with appropriate choices of parameter values and of linear and nonlinear characteristics. For the flute family, this simplest model gives waveforms and phase relations closely resembling those observed at resonance in the organ-pipe experiments of Coltman [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 60, 725–733 (1976)], including the triangular pressure and velocity waveforms. It can be shown (again using a time-domain approach) that the triangular waveform is a universal limiting form, independent of detailed acoustic loss mechanisms provided losses are small. \textcopyright1983, Acoustical Society of America.

abstract = {This major work covers almost all that has been learned about the acoustics of stringed instruments from Helmholtz's 19th-century theoretical elaborations to recent electroacoustic and holographic measurements. Many of the results presented here were uncovered by the author himself (and by his associates and students) over a 20-year period of research on the physics of instruments in the violin family. Lothar Cremer is one of the world's most respected authorities on architectural acoustics and, not incidentally, an avid avocational violinist and violist.The book―which was published in German in 1981―first of all meets the rigorous technical standards of specialists in musical acoustics. But it also serves the needs and interests of two broader groups: makers and players of stringed instruments are expressly addressed, since the implications of the mathematical formulations are fully outlined and explained; and acousticians in general will find that the work represents a textbook illustration of the application of fundamental principles and up-to-date techniques to a specific problem. The first―and longest―of the book's three parts investigates the oscillatory responses of bowed (and plucked) strings. The natural nonlinearities that derive from considerations of string torsion and bending stiffness are deftly handled and concisely modeled. The second part deals with the body of the instrument. Special attention is given to the bridge, which transmits the oscillations of the strings to the wooden body and its air cavity. In this case, linear modeling proves serviceable for the most part―a simplification that would not be possible with lute―like instruments such as the guitar. The radiation of sound from the body into the listener's space, which is treated as an extension of the instrument itself, is the subject of the book's final part.},

The collection surveys the core commitments of the PDP framework, the key issues the framework has addressed, and the debates the framework has spawned, and presents viewpoints on the current status of these issues. The articles focus on both historical roots and contemporary developments in learning, optimality theory, perception, memory, language, conceptual knowledge, cognitive control, and consciousness. Here we consider the approach more generally, reviewing the original motivations, the resulting framework, and the central tenets of the underlying theory. We then evaluate the impact of PDP both on the field at large and within specific subdomains of cognitive science and consider the current role of PDP models within the broader landscape of contemporary theoretical frameworks in cognitive science. Looking to the future, we consider the implications for cognitive science of the recent success of machine learning systems called "deep networks"-systems that build on key ideas presented in the PDP volumes. \textcopyright2014 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

abstract = {As a small business develops it moves through five growth stages, each with its own distinctive characteristics. Because the transition from one stage to the next requires change, it will be accompanied by some crisis or another. Crises tend to be disruptive and the problems of change can be minimized if managers are proactive rather than reactive. Prior knowledge of what generates crises and what to expect in each stage will smooth the process of change. This article proposes a model of small business growth to enable managers of small businesses to plan for future growth. The model has been successfully tested and used by the authors in analysing and solving the problem of growing small businesses. The model isolates the five growth stages, the sort of things that will precipitate crises and the major strategies that should be considered at each stage. Its main purpose is as a diagnostic tool in analysing the firm's present position and in planning what will be required as it progresses to the next stage of its development. \textcopyright1987.},

The application of these ideas to all the major fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms is discussed, and the various algorithms are compared. We present a new implementation of the real-valued split-radix FFT, an algorithm that uses fewer operations than any other real-valued power-of-2-length FFT. We also compare the performance of inherently real-valued transform algorithms such as the fast Hartley transform (FHT) and the fast cosine transform (FCT) to real-valued FFT algorithms for the computation of power spectra and cyclic convolutions. Comparisons of these techniques reveal that the alternative techniques always require more additions than a method based on a real-valued FFT algorithm and result in computer code of equal or greater length and complexity.

In this paper the concept of IF is extended to be able to cope with discrete time signals. The specific problem explored is that of estimating the IF of frequency modulated (FM) discrete-time signals imbedded in Gaussian noise. There are many well established methods for estimating the IF—these methods include differentiation of the phase and smoothing thereof, adaptive frequency estimation techniques such as the phase locked loop (PLL), and extraction of the peak from time-varying spectral representations. More recently methods based on a modeling of the signal phase as a polynomial have been introduced. All of these methods are reviewed, and their performances are compared on both simulated and real data. Guidelines are given as to which estimation method should be used for a given signal class and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). \textcopyright 1992 IEEE},

It is shown here how their numerical approach and the underlying physical model can be improved in order to simulate the motion of the piano string with a high d e g e e of realism. Starting from the fundamental equations of a damped, stlff string interacting with a nonlinear hammer, a numericalfinite difference scheme is derived,from which the time and spatial dependence of string displacement, velocity, and interactingforce between hammer and string, as well as theforce acting on the bridge, are computed in the time-domain. The strength of the model is illustrated by comparisons between measured and simulated piano tones. After this verification of the accuracy of the method, the model is used as a tool for systematically exploring the influence of string stiffness, relative strikin, position, and hammer-string mass ratio on string waveforms and spectra.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms were developed initially by Holland et al. in the 1960s and 1970s!!! Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and is Director of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.},

But the accurate detection of the rank of the constraint matrix is also very critical to the accuracy of the computed solution. In this work, we examine the solution of the constrained problem using weighting approach. We demonstrate that all computations can be carried out using a static data structure that is generated using the symbolic structure of the input matrices, making use of a recently proposed rank detection procedure. We show good speed-ups in solving large and sparse equality conditioned least squares problems on hypercubes up to 128 processors.},

abstract = {When the standard classical guitar is scaled up a musical fourth to a treble guitar, down a musical fifth to a baritone guitar, and down an octave to a bass guitar, design compromises are necessary to maintain playability and favourable tone qulality. The resulting instruments exhibit interesting natural vibration mode and sound radiation physics. The tone qualities of the new instruments suggest relations between the guitar response envelope and human sound perception. Translating the principle natural modes of the guitar up or down with string frequencies does not necessarily produce pleasing tone qualities nor optimal playing dynamics. However, designing bracing configurations for both classical and folk baritone and bass guitars to maximise low frequency radiation eficiency does seem to produce new instruments of musical appeal, Frequency response records of standard and guitar family variants illustrate the physical behaviour of the difierent designs. Experience of musicians with the guitar family instruments indicates that creative new guitar territory is available.},

abstract = {The 2D digital waveguide mesh has proven to be effective and efficient in the modeling of musical membranes and plates, particularly in combination with recent simplifications in modeling stiffness, nonlinearities, and felt mallet excitations. The rectilinear 3D extension to the mesh had been suggested, and has been applied to the case of room acoustics. However, it requires the use of 6-port scattering junctions, which make a multiply-free implementation impossible in the isotropic case. The 4-port scattering junctions of the 2D mesh required only an internal divide by 2, which could be implemented as a right shift in binary arithmetic. However, the 6-port junction requires a divide by 3. The multiply-free cases occur for N-port junctions in which N is a power of two. We propose here a tetrahedral distribution of multiply-free 4-port scattering junctions filling space much like the molecular structure of the diamond crystal, where the placement of the scattering junctions corresponds to the placement of the carbon nuclei, and the bi-directional delay units correspond to the four tetrahedrally spaced single bonds between each pair of nuclei. We show that the tetrahedral mesh is mathematically equivalent to a finite difference scheme (FDS) which approximates the 3D lossless wave equation. We further compute the frequency- and direction-dependent plane wave propagation speed dispersion error},

The commonly used accounting and financial tool for such classification and prediction is a multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) of financial ratios. But the MDA technique has limitations based on its assumptions of linear separability, multivariate normality, and independence of the predictive variables. A neural network, being free from such constraining assumptions, is able to achieve superior results. Our neural network model is the Cascade-Correlation architecture recently developed by Scott E. Fahlman and Christian Lebiere at Carnegie Mellon University. This new approach solves the hidden architecture enigma encountered using other types of neural networks. Also, Cascade-Correlation manages error signals in a manner which significantly improves execution speed. Our research is the first to use Cascade-Correlation for corporate health estimation. \textcopyright1995.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

An interpolant constructed in this way does not require solving a system of linear equations as many approaches do. However there are vanishing tangent vectors at the interpolating points. By blending with a Bezier curve using the data points as the control points, the blended curve is a proper smooth interpolant. The blending factor has the effect similar to the "tension" control of tension splines. Piecewise interpolants can be constructed in an analogous way as a connection of Bezier curve segments to achieve C1 continuity at the connecting points. Smooth interpolating surface patches can also be defined by blending sinusoidal polynomial tensor surfaces and Bezier tensor surfaces. The interpolant can very efficiently be evaluated by tabulating the sinusoidal function.},

@article{1996SandholmMultiagent,
author = {S and Tuomas W Holm and Robert H Crites},
abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the idea that the tendency to produce an action should be strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favourable results, and weakened if it produces unfavourable results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that does not need a model of its environment and can be used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL research has been confined to single-agent settings or to multiagent settings where the agents have totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither totally positively nor totally negatively correlated. RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain. This paper investigates the ability of a variety of Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent is the fixed strategy Tit-For-Tat, while in others it is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to play optimally against Tit-For-Tat. Playing against another learner was more difficult because the adaptation of the other learner created a non-stationary environment, and because the other learner was not endowed with any a priori knowledge about the IPD game such as a policy designed to encourage cooperation. The learners that were studied varied along three dimensions: the length of history they received as context, the type of memory they employed (look up tables based on restricted history windows or recurrent neural networks that can theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in the past), and the exploration schedule they followed. Although all the learners faced difficulties when playing against other learners, agents with longer history windows, lookup table memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best in the IPD games.},

During aging above the glass transition temperature at various humidities single helical (V and E-type) and double helical (B-type) crystallinity was formed. The rate of crystallization is a function of water and glycerol content. The amorphous rubbery materials were soft and weak with high elongations. During aging the materials became less flexible with higher elastic modulus and tensile stress. The changes are related to changes in water content and glass transition temperature and to changes in B-type crystallinity. The changes in stress-strain properties are explained by the formation of helical structures and crystals, which results in a reinforcement of the starch network by physical crosslinking. \textcopyright1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Recent research on Physical Modeling has led to 2-D discrete-time structures based on the Digital Waveguides. These structures are well suited for efficient yet accurate simulation of wave propagation in an ideal membrane. Nevertheless, real membranes exhibit a different behaviour, due to the environmental conditions and to the material they are made of. In this work we consider some aspects, crucial for the audio signal, of the physical phenomena concerning real membranes, and we will develop a 2-D waveguide model encompassing the effects of these aspects. In order to excite the simulated membrane, we will consider a hammer model previously developed for piano strings, and here adapted to fit the hammer-membrane interaction.},

abstract = {Digital waveguides may be used to construct efficient physical models of musical instruments and other resonant systems. They are commonly used to model systems with simple boundary conditions, such as strings and square membranes. Membranes are modelled by connecting digital waveguides together to form a mesh; however when modelling circular membranes, such as those found in percussive drums or microphones, the mesh does not approximate well to the boundary shape. It was found that a two-dimensional triangular mesh structure, with rimguides attached around the edge could overcome this. In this paper several rimguide strategies have been explored. The best of these involves adjusting the phase delay so that the model is accurate for frequencies close to DC. The improvement is particularly noticeable for efficient (low sample rate) implementations.},

abstract = {Polylactic acids (PLA) are not new polymers. However, recent developments in the capability to manufacture the monomer economically from renewable feedstocks have placed these materials at the forefront of the emerging biodegradable plastics industry. Increasing realisation of the intrinsic properties of these polymers, coupled with a knowledge of how such properties can be manipulated to achieve compatibility with thermoplastics processing, manufacturing, and end-use requirements has fuelled technological and commercial interest in PLA products. This paper discusses the various technologies being used to produce polylactic acids. In addition, attention is drawn to how monomer stereochemistry can be controlled to impart targeted utility in the final polymers. Specific applications are described to illustrate further the range of properties that can be developed by utilising both the basic monomer/polymer chemistries in combination with post-modification techniques. Finally, the biodegradation mechanism of polylactic acids will be discussed and contrasted with other biodegradable polymers. \textcopyright1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.},

The key to this is the book's use of new geometric arguments in place of the standard calculational ones. These geometric arguments are communicated with the aid of hundreds of diagrams of a standard seldom encountered in mathematical works. A new approach to a classical topic, this work will be of interest to students in mathematics, physics, and engineering, as well as to professionals in these fields.},

It explores probabilistic models of supervised learning problems, and addresses the key statistical and computational questions. Research on pattern classification with binary-output networks is surveyed, including a discussion of the relevance of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Estimates of this dimension are calculated for several neural network models. A model of classification by real-output networks is developed, and the usefulness of classification with a large margin is demonstrated. The authors explain the role of scale-sensitive versions of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension in large margin classification, and in real estimation. They also discuss the computational complexity of neural network learning, describing a variety of hardness results, and outlining two efficient constructive learning algorithms. The book is self-contained and is intended to be accessible to researchers and graduate students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics.},

@article{1999ChellapillaEvolution,
author = {Kumar Chellapilla and David B Fogel},
abstract = {Intelligence pertains to the ability to make appropriate decisions in light of specific goals and to adapt behavior to meet those goals in a range of environments. Mathematical games provide a framework for studying intelligent behavior in models of real-worm settings or restricted domains. The behavior of alternative strategies in these games is defined by each individual's stimulus-response mapping. Limiting these behaviors to linear functions of the environmental conditions renders the results to be little more than a facade: effective decision making in any complex environment almost always requires nonlinear stimulus-response mappings. The obstacle then comes in choosing the appropriate representation and learning algorithm. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms provide useful means for addressing these issues. This paper describes efforts to hybridize neural and evolutionary computation to learn appropriate strategies in zero- and nonzero-sum games, including the iterated prisoner's dilemma, tic-tac-toe, and checkers. With respect to checkers, the evolutionary algorithm was able to discover a neural network that can be used to play at a near-expert level without injecting expert knowledge about how to play the game. The implications of evolutionary learning with respect to machine intelligence are also discussed. It is argued that evolution provides the framework for explaining naturally occurring intelligent entities and can be used to design machines that are also capable of intelligent behavior.},

On top of these descriptors, various classification methods are implemented and tested. Over a dataset of 1007 tones from 27 musical instruments and without employing any hierarchical structure, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis shows the lowest error rate (7.19% for the individual instrument and 3.13% for instrument families), outperforming all the other classification methods (Canonical Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbours). The most relevant features are demonstrated to be the inharmonicity, the spectral centroid and the energy contained in the first partial.},

The aim of this research study is the implementation of soft computing methods to musical signal analysis and to the recognition of musical sounds and phrases. Accordingly, some methods based on such learning algorithms as neural networks, rough sets and fuzzy-logic were conceived, implemented and tested. Additionally, the above-mentioned methods were applied to the analysis and verification of subjective testing results. The last problem discussed within the framework of this book was the problem of fuzzy control of the classical pipe organ instrument. The obtained results show that computational intelligence and soft computing may be used for solving some vital problems in both musical and architectural acoustics.},

It is some of the most exciting work in cognitive science, unifying neural and cognitive processes in a highly computational framework, with links to artificial intelligence. Although thought and problem solving have a sequential character when viewed over a time frame of minutes or hours, the authors argue that each step in the sequence is the result of the simultaneous activity of a large number of simple computational elements, each influencing others and being influenced by them. "Parallel Distributed Processing" describes their work in developing a theoretical framework for describing this parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Volume 2 applies to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience. Some chapters describe models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Others discuss the relation between parallel distributed processing models and neurophysiology or describe models that are specifically addressed to neurophysiological data. The book concludes with an epilogue noting the strengths and weaknesses of the approach and directions for the future.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here, in informal text and about a score of plates, is a story that takes the teenage layman on this interesting trip. The younger reader, like a good musicologist, follows the steps in the evolution of the most important instruments that make up today's symphony orchestra, and the development of music itself (scales, modes, keys, and temperaments). Physics and music is also a source, although, of necessity a modest one, of information about the music research that has been underway in the Soviet Union, especially in the scientific manufacture of the violin, and in electrophonic and synthetic music. This why the foreign reader might think of a degree of "bias" on the part of the author. Yet, it gives him an insight into what is going on in a country that has given the world quite a number of great composers.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the main variants of the utility additive (UTA) multicriteria method, and systematically compares their predictive performance on two sets of data. It analyzes both those cases where the model provides a ranking with errors and those without errors. First, it shows that the reference projects should be chosen carefully in order to elicit as much information as possible from the decision maker: a set of projects satisfying a fractional factorial plan is recommended. Second, it discusses the use of alternative post-optimality methods for solving the problem of multiple solutions and their different predictive performances. Third, it presents the results of simulations based on utility functions involving interdependence between criteria, and shows that UTA handles this problem effectively by an adjustment of its coefficients. Finally, the influence of the model's parameters on the predictive performance is also investigated.},

@phdthesis{2001LairdPhysical,
author = {Joel Augustus Laird},
abstract = {In this thesis the physical modelling of percussive drums was approached using\ndigital waveguides. The constituent components of a drum were considered individually before connecting them together to complete the model.\nTo model the drumskin techniques were created to incorporate smooth curved\nboundaries, calculate the impedance of a 2D waveguide mesh and include the\neffect of the bearing edge. The accuracy of the curved boundary model, which\nutilised ‘rimguides', was demonstrated with a good reproduction of the first\nseven resonant modes of a circular membrane. The impedance was used in a\nkettledrum model where it correctly controlled the exchange of energy between\nthe drumskin and interior air. Simulations of different bearing edge sizes revealed that a blunt edge takes energy from low frequencies and redistributes\nit into higher frequencies. These decay faster and so the result is a decrease in\nsustain.\nFor the interior air it was necessary to correctly model 3D wave propagation\nand incorporate diffuse reflections, which occur at rough surfaces. Unlike 3D\nmeshes used in previous studies, the new dodecahedral mesh proposed here\nwas found to exhibit near direction independent dispersion error. The effect\nof diffusion was adequately simulated with a technique that was shown to be\ncontrollable, enabling different types of surface to be modelled.\nTo complete the drum model a way of connecting different waveguide meshes\ntogether was found and a new procedure for modelling a mallet exciter was\nproposed. The interfacing method enabled a lossless interconnection between\ntwo 2D meshes and also 2D and 3D meshes. The procedure used for the mallet exciter incorporated non-linear stiffness and the mallet's contact area. Its\nbehaviour was shown to be almost identical to that of a real mallet.\nFinally, a digital waveguide model of a kettledrum was constructed to demonstrate the techniques and the results were promising; the resonant modes were\nreproduced with good accuracy and their decay was sufficient to give the impression of realism, whilst not exactly matching that found through measurement.},

abstract = {Data compression is one of the main contributing factors in the explosive growth in information technology. Without it, a number of consumer and commercial products, such as DVD, videophone, digital camera, MP3, video-streaming and wireless PCS, would have been virtually impossible. Transforming the data to a frequency or other domain enables even more efficient compression. By illustrating this intimate link, The Transform and Data Compression Handbook serves as a much-needed handbook for a wide range of researchers and engineers. The authors describe various discrete transforms and their applications in different disciplines. They cover techniques, such as adaptive quantization and entropy coding, that result in significant reduction in bit rates when applied to the transform coefficients. With clear and concise presentations of the ideas and concepts, as well as detailed descriptions of the algorithms, the authors provide important insight into the applications and their limitations. Data compression is an essential step towards the efficient storage and transmission of information. The Transform and Data Compression Handbook provides a wealth of information regarding different discrete transforms and demonstrates their power and practicality in data compression.},

abstract = {This article describes the origins of categorical data analysis and the main categorical methods applied in geographic and regional science research. After introducing important terminology by using a 2×2 contingency table, categorical methods are reviewed for two distinctive situations - association and prediction. First, loglinear models are reviewed as a method of assessing associations and likelihoods among a set of categorical variables. Second, logistic regression is reviewed as a method for predicting the probability of a dichotomous response variable from among predictor variables. Additional approaches to categorical data analysis, such as the conditional logit, the multinomial logit, probit, and lograte models, are also discussed. The article concludes by describing recent developments in spatially explicit versions of categorical data methods for geographical research.},

abstract = {The technique of DigitalWaveguide Modelling for musical instruments and room acoustics modelling is now quite firmly established. In this thesis we provide an investigation in to the practical use and extension of the technique in musical instrument models, with an emphasis towards models of drums. The standard waveguide technique is described and analysed mathematically for basic models in one, two and three dimensions. Results of simulations are provided and compared against expected theoretical output. Methods to improve the quality of the simulations by considering the boundary termination and correcting the numerical dispersion error are discussed. A model for a drum is presented which utilises a technique to interface 2D and 3D mesh structures. An analysis of the model is provided which compares the output to phenomena found from measurements of real instruments. Extensions to the simple waveguide are proposed which include the modelling of stiff media in both 1D and 2D. These models include bars, stiff strings, plates and stiff membranes and in each case model output is analysed in depth by comparing to expected theoretical output. We also discuss approaches to include material specific frequency dependent damping. The main contributions of this thesis have been in the analysis of the waveguide technique in 3D, the method of correcting dispersion error, the analysis and extension of the 1D and 2D stiff models and the development and extension of the interfacing technique used in the drum model. The original focus of the work was for drum modelling, but the analogies and implications to other musical instruments, and indeed in the area of room acoustics, are quite clear.},

abstract = {The field of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), also termed multiple criteria decision aid, or multiple criteria decision making (MCDM), has developed rapidly over the past quarter century and in the process a number of divergent schools of thought have emerged. This can make it difficult for a new entrant into the field to develop a comprehensive appreciation of the range of tools and approaches which are available to assist decision makers in dealing with the ever-present difficulties of seeking compromise or consensus between conflicting inter ests and goals, i.e. the "multiple criteria". The diversity of philosophies and models makes it equally difficult for potential users of MCDA, i.e. management scientists and/or decision makers facing problems involving conflicting goals, to gain a clear understanding of which methodologies are appropriate to their particular context. Our intention in writing this book has been to provide a compre hensive yet widely accessible overview of the main streams of thought within MCDA. We aim to provide readers with sufficient awareness of the underlying philosophies and theories, understanding of the practi cal details of the methods, and insight into practice to enable them to implement any of the approaches in an informed manner. As the title of the book indicates, our emphasis is on developing an integrated view of MCDA, which we perceive to incorporate both integration of differ ent schools of thought within MCDA, and integration of MCDA with broader management theory, science and practice.},

The results of all these measurements show that high frequency vibrations and radiation occurs signiﬁcantly from 1 to 14 kHz, but that the sound radiation has harmonics at frequencies up to 20 kHz. This report does not produce any experimental evidence as to the importance of the high frequency region from the subjective point of view, or to the correlation of the subjective impression of reverberation of the plates with measured data of early decay times, as these aspects were not addressed at this point.},

The numerical model allows one to study the influence of each component on the whole box, and the contribution of the modes of the components (wooden box and its parts, and air), to the coupled modes by calculating their participation factors.

Six professional guitarists played movement sequences in a fixed tempo. Left-hand finger movements were recorded in 3 dimensions, and the guitar sound was recorded synchronously. Assuming that performers prefer to avoid extreme joint angles when moving, the authors hypothesized 3 complexity factors. The results showed differential effects of the complexity factors on the performance measures and on participants' judgments of complexity. The results demonstrated that keeping the joints in the middle of their range is an important principle in guitar playing, and players exploit the available tolerance in timing and placement of the left-hand fingers to control the acoustic output variability. \textcopyright2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {A neural network based approach for product design is addressed in this article. Computer modeling, fuzzy set theory and semantic difference method are applied to set up an experiment. The experimental results are analyzed by applied back-propagation neural network, which establish the relationships between product-form parameters and adjective image words. A database for the connections among the design elements, product images and shape generation rules was constructed. A computer-aided system for product-form design was then developed based on this database. With the aid of this design system, a designer can generate 3D models of any product with different images by providing basic design elements and shape generation rules. Simultaneously, a rendered 3D model of the designed product and its images are also presented by this system. Therefore, changing the configuration parameter(s) until the product shape is acceptable can modify the image of a product. In this manner, the designed product can fit more closely to the consumers' desire. Chair design is taken as a case study; but this method can be used to develop other products. \textcopyright2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional time-domain numerical model of the vibration and acoustic radiation from a guitar. The model involves the transverse displacement of the string excited by a force pulse, the flexural motion of the soundboard, and the sound radiation. A specific spectral method is used for solving the Kirchhoff-Love's dynamic top plate model for a damped, heterogeneous orthotropic material. The air-plate interaction is solved with a fictitious domain method, and a conservative scheme is used for the time discretization. Frequency analysis is performed on the simulated sound pressure and plate velocity waveforms in order to evaluate quantitatively the transfer of energy through the various components of the coupled system: from the string to the soundboard and from the soundboard to the air. The effects of some structural changes in soundboard thickness and cavity volume on the produced sounds are presented and discussed. Simulations of the same guitar in three different cases are also performed: "in vacuo," in air with a perfectly rigid top plate, and in air with an elastic top plate. This allows comparisons between structural, acoustic, and structural-acoustic modes of the instrument. Finally, attention is paid to the evolution with time of the spatial pressure field. This shows, in particular, the complex evolution of the directivity pattern in the near field of the instrument, especially during the attack.},

abstract = {The term 'biomaterials' includes chemically unrelated products that are synthesised by microorganisms (or part of them) under different environmental conditions. One important family of biomaterials is bioplastics. These are polyesters that are widely distributed in nature and accumulate intracellularly in microorganisms in the form of storage granules, with physico-chemical properties resembling petrochemical plastics. These polymers are usually built from hydroxy-acyl-CoA derivatives via different metabolic pathways. Depending on their microbial origin, bioplastics differ in their monomer composition, macromolecular structure and physical properties. Most of them are biodegradable and biocompatible, which makes them extremely interesting from the biotechnological point of view.},

@book{2003SteinComplex,
author = {Elias M Stein and Rami Shakarchi},
abstract = {With this second volume, we enter the intriguing world of complex analysis. From the first theorems on, the elegance and sweep of the results is evident. The starting point is the simple idea of extending a function initially given for real values of the argument to one that is defined when the argument is complex. From there, one proceeds to the main properties of holomorphic functions, whose proofs are generally short and quite illuminating: the Cauchy theorems, residues, analytic continuation, the argument principle. With this background, the reader is ready to learn a wealth of additional material connecting the subject with other areas of mathematics: the Fourier transform treated by contour integration, the zeta function and the prime number theorem, and an introduction to elliptic functions culminating in their application to combinatorics and number theory. Thoroughly developing a subject with many ramifications, while striking a careful balance between conceptual insights and the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis, Complex Analysis will be welcomed by students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which Complex Analysis is the second, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.},

The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the ﬁrst algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm's parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.},

Children in the experimental group (n= 63) received individual piano lessons weekly for three years and were given an acoustic piano at no cost to their families. Children in the control group (n= 54) did not participate in formal music instruction. Participants were administered tests of self-esteem, academic achievement, cognitive abilities, musical abilities, and motor proficiency at the beginning of the project and throughout the three years of piano instruction. The results indicated that piano instruction had a positive effect on children's self-esteem and school music marks but did not affect their academic achievement in math and language as measured by standardized tests and school report cards.

abstract = {A large variety of wheat gluten based bioplastics, which were plasticized with glycerol, were subjected to biodegradation. The materials covered the total range available for the biochemical control parameter Fi, which expresses the percentage of aggregated proteins. This quantity can be related to the density of covalent crosslinks in the wheat gluten network, which are induced by technological treatments. The biodegradability tests were performed in liquid medium (modified Sturm test) and in farmland soil. All gluten materials were fully degraded after 36 days in aerobic fermentation and within 50 days in farmland soil. No significant differences were observed between the samples. The mineralization half-life time of 3.8 days in the modified Sturm test situated gluten materials among fast degrading polymers. The tests of microbial inhibition experiments revealed no toxic effects of the modified gluten or of its metabolites. Thus, the protein bulk of wheat gluten materials is non-toxic and fully biodegradable, whatever the technological process applied. \textcopyright2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The SOFNN is based on ellipsoidal basis function (EBF) neurons consisting of a center vector and a width vector. New methods of the structure learning and the parameter learning, based on new adding and pruning techniques and a recursive on-line learning algorithm, are proposed and developed. A proof of the convergence of both the estimation error and the linear network parameters is also given in the paper. The proposed methods are very simple and effective and generate a fuzzy neural model with a high accuracy and compact structure. Simulation work shows that the SOFNN has the capability of self-organization to determine the structure and parameters of the network automatically. \textcopyright2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@book{2004OdianPrinciples,

abstract = {This book deals specifically with processes aimed at the manufacture of polymeric materials. Consistent with the task of engineering science, it emphasizes concepts and principles. The goal is the formulation of generalizations that will be useful in the design, scaling, and modification of polymerization processes. Strategy consists of constructing and analyzing the behavior of relevant model processes and is therefore largely heuristic. Results, whenever possible, take the form of dimensionless algorithms or criteria, with clear physical significance to facilitate their application to actual processes. Actual processes are used occasionally as examples, where sufficient knowledge and data are available. This book is directed primarily toward the industrial engineer or scientist in research or development with a firm technical background who is attempting to apply that background to polymerization processes. It should also be suitable as a text for courses dealing with chemical engineering aspects of polymer processes. Chapter 1 consists of a collection of fundamental concepts on which subsequent chapters are based. Chapter 2 discusses phenomena that are inherent in polymerization reactions. Chapters 3-5 deal with physical factors that affect, or are affected by, polymerizations on an engineering scale. Chapter 6 treats postreactor separation of unreacted monomer and/or diluents.},

Originally published in 1989, its objective remains to clearly present the basic methods necessary to perform finite difference schemes and to understand the theory underlying the schemes. Finite Difference Schemes and Partial Differential Equations, Second Edition is one of the few texts in the field to not only present the theory of stability in a rigorous and clear manner but also to discuss the theory of initial-boundary value problems in relation to finite difference schemes. Fourier analysis is used throughout the book to give a unified treatment of many of the important ideas found in the first eleven chapters. The material on elliptic partial differential equations found in the later chapters provides an introduction that will enable students to progress to more advanced texts and to knowledgeably implement the basic methods. This updated edition includes several important modifications. stability and is more prevalent throughout the book. The author has added many new figures and tables to clarify important concepts and illustrate the properties of finite difference schemes.},

@phdthesis{2004TraubeInterdisciplinary,
author = {Caroline Traube},
abstract = {This dissertation proposes an interdisciplinary approach for the study of the timbre of the classical guitar. We start by identifying the static control parameters of timbre, relating to the structural components of the guitar and the dynamic control parameters of timbre, relating to the gestures applied by the performer on the instrument. From the plucked string physical model (obtained from the tranverse wave equation), we derive a digital signal interpretation of the plucking eﬀect which is a comb ﬁltering. Then we investigate how subjective characteristics of sound, like timbre, are related to gesture parameters. The starting point for exploration is an inventory of verbal descriptors commonly used by professional musicians to describe the brightness, the colour, the shape and the texture of the sounds they produce on their instruments. An explanation for the voice-like nature of guitar tones is proposed based on the observation that the maxima of the comb-ﬁltershaped magnitude spectrum of guitar tones are located at frequencies similar to the formant frequencies of a subset of identiﬁable vowels. These analogies at the spectral level might account for the origin of some timbre descriptors such as open, oval, round, thin, closed, nasal and hollow, that seem to refer to phonetic gestures. In a experiment conducted to conﬁrm these analogies, participants were asked to associate a consonant to the attack and a vowel to the decay of guitar tones. The results of this study support the idea that some perceptual dimensions of the guitar timbre space can be borrowed from phonetics. Finally, we address the problem of the indirect acquisition of instrumental gesture parameters. Pursuing previous research on the estimation of the plucking position from a recording, we propose a new estimation method based on an iterative weighted least-square algorithm, starting from a ﬁrst approximation derived from a variant of the autocorrelation function of the signal.},

abstract = {'Strategic Operations Management' examines the latest thinking in this fast-moving area. Businesses constantly face ongoing and increased amounts of competition. Coping with this competition demands that strategies must be already in place which can deal with key questions such as: what business is the firm really in? what does the firm do best, and why, where, and how can it outsource some of its activities? how can opportunities become quickly exploited and how can the firm's capabilities help to ward off external threats from new and existing players? This text believes that successful operations management depends on having strategies in place which combine both manufacturing and service areas into an overall customer offering. This means that strategic relations must be established with other players - operations management is no longer a firm-specific matter. 'Strategic Operations Management' combines four themes; strategy, services, innovation and management of relationships both in the supply chain and with other players. This is done by dividing chapters into a past/present/future scenario approach which illustrates how these strategies affect business.

In this paper, we apply this issue to a search-theoretic framework (posted-price market) where sellers are confronted with a population of imperfectly informed buyers and take one decision per period (posted prices) with no direct interactions between sellers. We focus on three different scenarios with varying buyers' characteristics. For each of these scenarios, we quantitatively and qualitatively test whether the learned variable (price strategy) converges to the Nash equilibrium. We also study the impact of the temperature parameter (deﬁning the exploitation/exploration trade off) on these results.},

abstract = {The paper presents a new reinforcement learning mechanism for spiking neural networks. The algorithm is derived for networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons, but it can be also applied to generic spiking neural networks. Learning is achieved by synaptic changes that depend on the firing ofpre- and postsynaptic neurons, and that are modulated with a global reinforcement signal. The efficacy of the algorithm is verified in a biologically-inspired experiment, featuring a simulated worm that searches for food. Our model recovers a form of neural plasticity experimentally observed in animals, combining spiketiming-dependent synaptic changes of one sign with nonassociative synaptic changes of the opposite sign determined by presynaptic spikes. The model also predicts that the time constant of spike-timing-dependent synaptic changes is equal to the membrane time constant of the neuron, in agreement with experimental observations in the brain. This study also led to the discovery of a biologically-plausible reinforcement learning mechanism that works by modulating spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a global reward signal. \textcopyright2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {When generating new design concepts, most industrial designers tend to draw upon stereotypical images and their own personal design experiences. The evaluation of each individual design candidate in terms of its ability to meet the demands of the marketplace is a crucial step within the conceptual design stage. Consequently, this paper proposes a method which enables an automatic product form search or product image evaluation by means of fuzzy neural network and genetic algorithm. Initially, a feature-based hierarchical computer-aided design (CAD) model is constructed, in which the related form parameters are thoroughly defined in applicable domains to facilitate the automatic generation of new product forms. A fuzzy neural network algorithm is then applied to establish the relationships between the input form parameters and a series of adjectival image words. In a reverse process, genetic algorithm is employed to search for a near-optimal design which satisfies the designer's required product image by using the trained neural network as a fitness function. The proposed method provides an automatic design system, which gives designers the ability to rapidly obtain a product form and its corresponding image, or to search for the ideal form which fits a required image in a shorter lead-time. An electronic door lock design is chosen as the subject of the current investigation. However, the proposed method is equally applicable to the design of other products. \textcopyright2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Today the question of what scenarios are is unclear except with regard to one point - they have become extremely popular. This paper attempts to shed light on differences in scenario approaches. It will describe the origin of scenarios and the development of different understandings and purposes for managers. Categories are developed to compare the different ways scenarios are performed.

The main objective of this chapter is to analytically present the UTA method and its variants and to summarize the progress made in this field. The historical background and the philosophy of the aggregation-disaggregation approach are firstly given. The detailed presentation of the basic UTA algorithm is presented, including discussion on the stability and sensitivity analyses. Several variants of the UTA method, which incorporate different forms of optimality criteria, are also discussed. The implementation of the UTA methods is illustrated by a general overview of UTA-based DSSs, as well as real-world decision-making applications.

METHODS: Observational and cross-sectional study, developed at the UFPB Medical School, involving interns enrolled under the new medical course curriculum. A pretested questionnaire prepared by the authors was applied. RESULTS: The sample population was of 124 students (91.2% of the total number of interns). The average percentage of satisfied students was 49.6%, inversely correlated to the number of rotations already attended. The highest degree of satisfaction was observed in the Family Medicine rotation (76%), and the lowest in the Internal Medicine rotation (23.1%), when all aspects were evaluated. Other findings included: a lack of preceptors in associated hospitals, excessive administrative activities, conflicting relationship with residents, insufficient practice and focus on very specific problems. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that UFPB medical students' satisfaction with the internship program was low. The Internal Medicine rotation reported the lowest percentage in all aspects evaluated, while the Family Medicine rotation reported the highest. Furthermore, it was found that the Internship regulations were not being upheld adequately.},

@article{2006BakkalbasiThree,

abstract = {Background: Researchers turn to citation tracking to find the most influential articles for a particular topic and to see how often their own published papers are cited. For years researchers looking for this type of information had only one resource to consult: the Web of Science from Thomson Scientific. In 2004 two competitors emerged – Scopus from Elsevier and Google Scholar from Google. The research reported here uses citation analysis in an observational study examining these three databases; comparing citation counts for articles from two disciplines (oncology and condensed matter physics) and two years (1993 and 2003) to test the hypothesis that the different scholarly publication coverage provided by the three search tools will lead to different citation counts from each. Methods: Eleven journal titles with varying impact factors were selected from each discipline (oncology and condensed matter physics) using the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). All articles published in the selected titles were retrieved for the years 1993 and 2003, and a stratified random sample of articles was chosen, resulting in four sets of articles. During the week of November 7–12, 2005, the citation counts for each research article were extracted from the three sources. The actual citing references for a subset of the articles published in 2003 were also gathered from each of the three sources. Results: For oncology 1993 Web of Science returned the highest average number of citations, 45.3. Scopus returned the highest average number of citations (8.9) for oncology 2003. Web of Science returned the highest number of citations for condensed matter physics 1993 and 2003 (22.5 and 3.9 respectively). The data showed a significant difference in the mean citation rates between all pairs of resources except between Google Scholar and Scopus for condensed matter physics 2003. For articles published in 2003 Google Scholar returned the largest amount of unique citing material for oncology and Web of Science returned the most for condensed matter physics. Conclusion: This study did not identify any one of these three resources as the answer to all citation tracking needs. Scopus showed strength in providing citing literature for current (2003) oncology articles, while Web of Science produced more citing material for 2003 and 1993 condensed matter physics, and 1993 oncology articles. All three tools returned some unique material. Our data indicate that the question of which tool provides the most complete set of citing literature may depend on the subject and publication year of a given article.},

abstract = {Many of the key algorithmic challenges in the context of the internet require considering the objectives and interests of the different participants involved. These include problems ranging from pricing goods and resources, to improving search, to routing, and more generally to understanding how incentives of participants can be harnessed to improve the behavior of the overall system. As a result, Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Game Theory, which can be viewed as "incentive-aware algorithm design," have become an increasingly important part of algorithmic research in recent years. Along different lines, the area of Machine Learning has made continued progress in developing methods that can generalize from data, adapt to changing environments, and improve performance with experience, as well as progress in understanding fundamental underlying issues. It is clear these capabilities will be critical as well in the context of such large decentralized systems. While these areas seem quite distinct, recent results of the PIs have developed a number of important connections between them: fundamental questions in Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Game Theory turn out to have a strong relation to issues in Machine Learning and vice versa, and techniques from each seem well-poised to help with key problems of the other. The aim of this proposal is to further develop these connections in order to produce powerful mechanisms for adaptive and networked environments, and improve the experience of users of the Web and internet},

@book{2006DevoreModern,

abstract = {Probability and Statistics are studied by most science students, usually as a second- or third-year course. Many current texts in the area are just cookbooks and, as a result, students do not know why they perform the methods they are taught, or why the methods work. The strength of this book is that it readdresses these shortcomings; by using examples, often from real-life and using real data, the authors can show how the fundamentals of probabilistic and statistical theories arise intuitively. It provides a tried and tested, self-contained course, that can also be used for self-study. A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics has numerous quick exercises to give direct feedback to the students. In addition the book contains over 350 exercises, half of which have answers, of which half have full solutions. A website at www.springeronline.com/1-85233-896-2 gives access to the data files used in the text, and, for instructors, the remaining solutions. The only pre-requisite for the book is a first course in calculus; the text covers standard statistics and probability material, and develops beyond traditional parametric models to the Poisson process, and on to useful modern methods such as the bootstrap. This will be a key text for undergraduates in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology and Business Studies who are studying a mathematical statistics course, and also for more intensive engineering statistics courses for undergraduates in all engineering subjects.},

abstract = {As with all new ideas, the concept of Open Innovation requires extensive empirical investigation, testing and development. This paper analyzes Procter and Gamble's 'Connect and Develop' strategy as a case study of the major organizational and technological changes associated with open innovation. It argues that although some of the organizational changes accompanying open innovation are beginning to be described in the literature, more analysis is warranted into the ways technological changes have facilitated open innovation strategies, particularly related to new product development. Information and communications technologies enable the exchange of distributed sources of information in the open innovation process. The case study shows that furthermore a suite of new technologies for data mining, simulation, prototyping and visual representation, what we call 'innovation technology', help to support open innovation in Procter and Gamble. The paper concludes with a suggested research agenda for furthering understanding of the role played by and consequences of this technology. \textcopyright2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

TPCS was plasticized with novel plasticizers urea and formamide, and the activated-montmorillonites were obtained using citric acid as the activated solvent. Compared with urea and formamide-plasticized thermoplastic cornstarch (UFTPCS), the mechanical properties of nanocomposites were very good. The thermal analysis was investigated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The effect of water content on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites was studied. Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) was also carried out. The structure and morphology of biodegradable nanocomposites were characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). It was revealed that UFTPCS were intercalated into the layers of MMT successfully, and layers of MMT were fully exfoliated and so formed the exfoliated nanocomposites with MMT. This manufacturing process is simple and environmentally friendly.},

They discretize the system with respect to time, because the aim is to run the simulation using a computer. The physics-based modelling methods can be classified as mass-spring, modal, wave digital, finite difference, digital waveguide and source-filter models. We present the basic theory and a discussion on possible extensions for each modelling technique. For some methods, a simple model example is chosen from the existing literature demonstrating a typical use of the method. For instance, in the case of the digital waveguide modelling technique a vibrating string model is discussed, and in the case of the wave digital filter technique we present a classical piano hammer model. We tackle some nonlinear and time-varying models and include new results on the digital waveguide modelling of a nonlinear string. Current trends and future directions in physical modelling of musical instruments are discussed. \textcopyright2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This book, written by 30 experts, presents the theoretical background of acoustics and of LES, followed by details about numerical methods, e.g. discretization schemes, boundary conditions, coupling aspects. Industrially relevant, hybrid RANS/LES techniques for acoustic source predictions are presented in detail. Many applications are featured ranging from simple geometries for mixing layers and jet flows to complex wing and car geometries. Selected applications include recent scientific investigations at industrial and university research institutions. Presently one can't offer perfect solution methodologies that address all relevant applications, however the book presents a state of the art collection of methods, tools and evaluation methodologies. The advantages and weaknesses of both the commercial and the research methodologies are carefully presented.},

A firm negotiating next year's wage is playing a bargaining game. The opposing candidates in an election are playing a political game. The supermarket's price for corn flakes is decided by playing an economic game.Game theory is about how to play such games in a rational way. Even when the players have not thought everything out in advance, game theory often works for the same reason that mindless animals sometimes end up behaving very cleverly: evolutionary forces eliminate irrational play because it is unfit.Game theory has seen spectacular successes in evolutionary biology and economics, and is beginning to revolutionize other disciplines from psychology to political science.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We use a multi-method, comparative case study of two large-scale sporting event organizing committees, with a particular focus on interviews with managers at three hierarchical levels. We support the positive relationship between number of stakeholder attributes and perceived stakeholder salience. Managers' hierarchical level and role have direct and moderating effects on stakeholder identification and perceived salience. We also found that most stakeholders were definitive, dominant, or dormant types - the other five types were rare. Power has the most important effect on salience, followed by urgency and legitimacy. Based on our case study, we offer several ways to advance the theory of stakeholder identification and salience. \textcopyright2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Do you want easy access to the latest methods in scientific computing? This greatly expanded third edition of Numerical Recipes has it, with wider coverage than ever before, many new, expanded and updated sections, and two completely new chapters. The executable C++ code, now printed in color for easy reading, adopts an object-oriented style particularly suited to scientific applications. Co-authored by four leading scientists from academia and industry, Numerical Recipes starts with basic mathematics and computer science and proceeds to complete, working routines. The whole book is presented in the informal, easy-to-read style that made earlier editions so popular. Highlights of the new material include: a new chapter on classification and inference, Gaussian mixture models, HMMs, hierarchical clustering, and SVMs; a new chapter on computational geometry, covering KD trees, quad- and octrees, Delaunay triangulation, and algorithms for lines, polygons, triangles, and spheres; interior point methods for linear programming; MCMC; an expanded treatment of ODEs with completely new routines; and many new statistical distributions.},

abstract = {Traditionally the emphasis in neural network research has been on improving their performance as a means of pattern recognition. Here we take an alternative approach and explore the remarkable similarity between the under-performance of neural networks trained to behave optimally in economic situations and observed human performance in the laboratory under similar circumstances. In particular, we show that neural networks are consistent with observed laboratory play in two very important senses. Firstly, they select a rule for behavior which appears very similar to that used by laboratory subjects. Secondly, using this rule they perform optimally only approximately 60% of the time. \textcopyright2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The object of the study is the sounding board of an acoustic guitar, the main structural material of which is a three-layer birch veneer. Based on the finite-element method, a corresponding calculation model is created, and the steady-state regimes of forced vibrations of the sounding board are investigated. A good correspondence between calculation results and experimental data is found to exist. \textcopyright2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {Rich representations in reinforcement learning have been studied for the purpose of enabling generalization and making learning feasible in large state spaces. We introduce Object-Oriented MDPs (OO-MDPs), a representation based on objects and their interactions, which is a natural way of modeling environments and offers important generalization opportunities. We introduce a learning algorithm for deterministic OO-MDPs and prove a polynomial bound on its sample complexity. We illustrate the performance gains of our representation and algorithm in the well-known Taxi domain, plus a real-life videogame. Copyright 2008 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

The role of each component of the violin is described in details. We also discuss the importance of the bridge, the plates and the body normal modes of vibration for the acoustical response of the instrument. The air-resonance of the enclosed air in the violin body (Helmholtz resonance) is disscussed using the equivalent fomalism between mechanical, electrical and acoustic oscillating systems. The production of the characteristic sound of the violin, which results from the vibrational waveform of a bowed string, is also described. Copyright by the Sociedade Brasileira de F\'isica.},

abstract = {The evolution of the electronic age has led to the development of numerous medical databases on the World Wide Web, offering search facilities on a particular subject and the ability to perform citation analysis. We compared the content coverage and practical utility of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The official Web pages of the databases were used to extract information on the range of journals covered, search facilities and restrictions, and update frequency. We used the example of a keyword search to evaluate the usefulness of these databases in biomedical information retrieval and a specific published article to evaluate their utility in performing citation analysis. All databases were practical in use and offered numerous search facilities. PubMed and Google Scholar are accessed for free. The keyword search with PubMed offers optimal update frequency and includes online early articles; other databases can rate articles by number of citations, as an index of importance. For citation analysis, Scopus offers about 20% more coverage than Web of Science, whereas Google Scholar offers results of inconsistent accuracy. PubMed remains an optimal tool in biomedical electronic research. Scopus covers a wider journal range, of help both in keyword searching and citation analysis, but it is currently limited to recent articles (published after 1995) compared with Web of Science. Google Scholar, as for the Web in general, can help in the retrieval of even the most obscure information but its use is marred by inadequate, less often updated, citation information.},

Thoroughly class-tested in courses at Stanford University and the University of Warwick, it is suitable for both applied mathematicians and engineers. The only prerequisites are an introductory undergraduate knowledge of basic linear algebra and differential equations. Unlike most existing works at this level, this book covers both isothermal and thermal theories. The theories are derived in a unified manner from the fundamental balance laws of continuum mechanics. Intended both for classroom use and for self-study, each chapter contains a wealth of exercises, with fully worked solutions to odd-numbered questions. A complete solutions manual is available to instructors upon request. Short bibliographies appear at the end of each chapter, pointing to material which underpins or expands upon the material discussed.},

abstract = {In the highly competitive market, varying product color to change its image is one of the best solutions to improve the product competitiveness. In this paper, the relationships among the product image, color area, and aesthetic measurement of the product are studied. The pixels of an area of color are used to obtain the proportionate relationship between different colored areas in a given solid visual angle. Based on the relationship among the Hue, Value, Chroma and colored area proposed by Munsell, the other factors are integrated to set up one formula for evaluating the aesthetic degree of color matching. The aesthetics measurement is considered to be influenced by the color environments, color areas, component colors and display angles of the product. The color planning for developing a cell phone was performed based on this model. The experimental results verified this model can be used for color planning in product design. \textcopyright2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Data analysis has been one of the core activities in scientific research, but limited by the availability of analysis methods in the past, data analysis was often relegated to data processing. To accommodate the variety of data generated by nonlinear and nonstationary processes in nature, the analysis method would have to be adaptive. Hilbert-Huang transform, consisting of empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert spectral analysis, is a newly developed adaptive data analysis method, which has been used extensively in geophysical research. In this review, we will briefly introduce the method, list some recent developments, demonstrate the usefulness of the method, summarize some applications in various geophysical research areas, and finally, discuss the outstanding open problems. We hope this review will serve as an introduction of the method for those new to the concepts, as well as a summary of the present frontiers of its applications for experienced research scientists.},

Games represent a widely accepted paradigm for representing interactive decision-making. We explored the potential value of neural networks for modeling and predicting human interactive learning in repeated games. We found that even very simple learning networks, driven by regret-based feedback, accurately predict observed human behavior in different experiments on 21 games with unique equilibria in mixed strategies. Introducing regret in the feedback dramatically improved the performance of the neural network. We show that regret-based models provide better predictions of learning than established economic models.},

abstract = {Critiques of urban renewal and large-scale developments were prominent in the period 1960-80. In particular, they emphasized the negative environmental and social consequences of these schemes and especially attacked them for displacing low-income and ethnically different populations. In the 1980s and 1990s, we saw a decline in such projects in many places, responding to popular protest and intellectual dissent, along with a new emphasis on preservation. More recently, however, we see the revival of mega-projects, often connected with tourism and sports development and incorporating the designs of world-famous architects. Frequently these are on landfill or abandoned industrial sites. The symposium for which this is an introduction shows the growing convergence of North American and European projects. This convergence is visible in their physical form, their financing, and in the role played by the state in a world marked by neoliberalism. At the same time, the new projects do display a greater environmental sensitivity and commitment to urbanity than the modernist schemes of an earlier epoch. \textcopyright2009 The Authors.

The energy and materials needed to sustain the present society are derived primarily from non-renewable fossil resources, which will be depleted at some point. Plastics are one example of an important commodity in the modern lifestyle. While plastics are undoubtedly superior materials in terms of their costs, processability and functional properties, they are currently derived from fossil resources and they are not readily assimilated by the various ecosystems upon disposal. The search for biodegradable plastics that are derived from renewable resources has been ongoing since the 1970s. Two of the most promising biobased plastics, i.e., polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates, have received much attention as potential alternatives to existing processes. This article will discuss the current status and sustainability of these two next generation biobased plastics by taking into consideration the raw materials required, as well as the post-consumption effects of these materials on the environment. In addition, important issues surrounding the development and sustainability of biobased and biodegradable plastics will be highlighted. \textcopyright2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract = {Drilling and completing either exploratory or development wells in Pre-Salt prospects present several challenges. The wells are located in very deep waters, beyond 2,000 m WD and they are also deep wells, with more than 5,000 m TVD. Pressure and temperature is normal, but contaminants such as H2S and CO2 represent an additional difficulty. Most of all, drilling through salt layers as thick as 2,000 m presents the most challenging aspect of these wells. Directional, extended reach (ERW), horizontal and multilateral wells will be evaluated for production development, but the reservoir is a carbonate horizon just below the salt, meaning that high angle navigation and multilateral joints will be located inside the salt layers. These wells measured depths will reach 8,000 m or more. The salt geo-mechanical loads on the casing and cementing will require high strength materials and high capacity rig equipment. The competency of the salt formations and, most of all, of the carbonate reservoir, totaling more than 3,000 m to be drilled, will require special BHA and bit design to increase penetration rates, thus reducing rig time. Carbonate reservoir will require production liner, perforations/slots and stimulation treatments designed to maximize production. Although these challenges could be overcome today, with existing technology, due to the current high costs scenario, well construction time and risks must be minimized. Some technology development is already underway to address these issues, but most of the gains can be materialized without new technology, by proper engineering design, risk management and learning curve acceleration. After 8 wells drilled in Pre-Salt prospects, Petrobras has already gained important know-how in these projects, but there is still a long way ahead. In the following years, well construction campaign for an Extended Well Testing (EWT) and a Pilot Production System in the Tupi Pre-Salt area, plus additional exploration wells, will provide field test opportunities for development and optimization of well engineering techniques and equipment. This paper will present the highlights of Petrobras E&P program to make the best use of these opportunities to leverage the well construction learning curve.},

abstract = {Abstract Pre-salt carbonate reservoirs from Santos Basin represent a great opportunity and probably the most important recent oil discovery. Tupi area (estimated to have recoverable volume of 5 to 8 bboe), which is the most known amongst several other leads in the cluster, is going to be a great insight for the production project. From the production point of view, this new frontier has technological challenges that are being addressed by PETROBRAS and partners. Special attention is being dedicated to anticipate solutions to potential problems. This will require a balance between innovative and field proven solutions. This paper addresses the most critical points, where Petrobras is making a great R&D effort, which are: Well technology, where casing stability, well cost and productivity are addressed, in a scenario of water depths beyond 2,200m, target depths greater than 5,000m, crossing salt layers that can reach 2,000m in thickness. Poorly known microbial carbonate reservoir, heterogeneous in vertical profile, spread over very large areas, with wettability concerns, requiring careful evaluation of the performance of the waterflooding method and EOR. Wax deposition, due to low temperature in the ocean bottom, imposing limitations to the subsea layout. Gas processing and exporting technologies concerning environmental issues: CO2 compact removal units aiming the minimization of emissions to the atmosphere. Production units placed in more than 2,000m water depth, with oceanic conditions quite severe and dealing with high CO2 content stream. These challenges deserve all Petrobras attention, but also count with the confidence in achieving good technological solutions, supported by the history of successful developments of the company. Introduction The history of success built by Petrobras in deep water Brazilian coast - mainly Campos Basin - was largely supported by successive discoveries of heavy oil in turbidite sandstones, step by step towards gradually deeper and deeper water depths (Carminatti et al., 2009). The Pre-salt discoveries of Santos Basin represent discovery of huge volumes of light oil (28 to 30 degrees API), with high gas content, in a very short time span, close the most important consuming centers in Southeastern Brazil, and formation tests in the first wells have presented very high flow rates with no indication of barriers. All are excellent news, although PETROBRAS and partners recognize that the Pre-salt of Santos Basin represents a challenging scenario: ultra-deep water (greater then 2,000 meters), deep carbonate reservoirs (deeper than 5,000 meters), spread over very large areas, with high gas-oil ratio (GOR in Tupi area greater than 200 m3/m3), CO2 content (8-12% in Tupi), high-pressure and low temperature, laying immediately bellow a thick salt layer (more than 2,000 meters of salt), located around 300 km from the coast, with oceanic conditions more severe than Campos Basin. This scenario demands using sometimes present day technology in the limit, and other times, adaption and development of technologies specific for such conditions. This paper addresses the most critical points to the development of production in the Pre-salt of Santos Basin, where Petrobras is making an R&D effort to develop and qualify new technologies, including well technology, reservoir technology, flow assurance, gas processing and exporting technologies, and production units. Additionally, the paper discusses briefly how PETROBRAS has organized its structure to face these technological challenges, including the creation of a technological program - PROSAL - focused on Pre-salt objectives.},

author = {Stefan Bilbao},
abstract = {Digital sound synthesis has long been approached using standard digital filtering techniques. Newer synthesis strategies, however, make use of physical descriptions of musical instruments, and allow for much more realistic and complex sound production and thereby synthesis becomes a problem of simulation. This book has a special focus on time domain finite difference methods presented within an audio framework. It covers time series and difference operators, and basic tools for the construction and analysis of finite difference schemes, including frequency-domain and energy-based methods, with special attention paid to problems inherent to sound synthesis. Various basic lumped systems and excitation mechanisms are covered, followed by a look at the 1D wave equation, linear bar and string vibration, acoustic tube modelling, and linear membrane and plate vibration. Various advanced topics, such as the nonlinear vibration of strings and plates, are given an elaborate treatment. Key features: Includes a historical overview of digital sound synthesis techniques, highlighting the links between the various physical modelling methodologies. A pedagogical presentation containing over 150 problems and programming exercises, and numerous figures and diagrams, and code fragments in the MATLAB\textregisteredprogramming language helps the reader with limited experience of numerical methods reach an understanding of this subject. Offers a complete treatment of all of the major families of musical instruments, including certain audio effects. Numerical Sound Synthesis is suitable for audio and software engineers, and researchers in digital audio, sound synthesis and more general musical acoustics. Graduate students in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering or computer science, working on the more technical side of digital audio and sound synthesis, will also find this book of interest. \textcopyright2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The idea for this book came from the time the authors spent at the Statistics and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina starting in fall 2003. The rst author was there for a total of two years, the rst year as a Duke/SAMSI Research Fellow. The second author was there for a year as a Post-Doctoral Scholar. The third author has the great fortune to be in RTP p- manently. SAMSI was – and remains – an incredibly rich intellectual environment with a general atmosphere of free-wheeling inquiry that cuts across established elds. SAMSI encourages creativity: It is the kind of place where researchers can be found at work in the small hours of the morning – computing, interpreting computations, and developing methodology. Visiting SAMSI is a unique and wonderful experience. The people most responsible for making SAMSI the great success it is include Jim Berger, Alan Karr, and Steve Marron. We would also like to express our gratitude to Dalene Stangl and all the others from Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, and NC State, as well as to the visitors (short and long term) who were involved in the SAMSI programs. It was a magical time we remember with ongoing appreciation.},

@book{2009CorduneanuAlmost,
author = {Constantin Corduneanu},
abstract = {This text is well designed with respect to the exposition from the preliminary to the more advanced and the applications interwoven throughout. It provides the essential foundations for the theory as well as the basic facts relating to almost periodicity. In six structured and self-contained chapters, the author unifies the treatment of various classes of almost periodic functions, while uniquely addressing oscillations and waves in the almost periodic case. The first half of the book lays the groundwork, noting the basic properties of almost periodic functions, while the second half of this work addresses applications whose main emphasis is on the solvability of ordinary or partial differential equations in the class of almost periodic functions. Key topics include: An introduction to metric spaces; Definition of several classes of almost periodic functions, including those of Bohr, Besicovitch, and Stepanov; Classical results on the mean value property; Convergence of Fourier series to any almost periodic function; Almost periodic solutions for ODEs in a linear setting; Almost periodic nonlinear oscillations; Almost periodic waves, including heat waves. The reader is taken from elementary and well-known facts through the latest results in almost periodic oscillation and waves. This is the first text to present these latest results. The presentation level and inclusion of several clearly presented proofs make this work ideal for graduate students in engineering and science. The concept of almost periodicity is widely applicable to continuuum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, plasma physics, dynamical systems, and astronomy, which makes the book a useful tool for mathematicians and physicists. \textcopyrightSpringer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

abstract = {This part will get you started in thinking about designing and analyzing algorithms. It is intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of the design strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the fundamental ideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will build upon this base. Chapter 1 is an overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. This chapter defines what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also makes a case that algorithms are a technology, just as are fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks. In Chapter 2, we see our first algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting a sequence of n numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not directly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the structure of the algorithm clearly enough that a competent programmer can implement it in the language of his choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, which uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive technique known as divide and conquer. Although the time each requires increases with the value of n, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We determine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful notation to express them. Chapter 3 precisely defines this notation, which we call asymptotic notation. It starts by defining several asymptotic notations, which we use for bounding algorithm running times from above and/or below. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily a presentation of mathematical notation. Its purpose is more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The stiff string wave equation has four solutions, two of which are fast-decaying waves introduced by the string stiffness. In the case of digital waveguide modeling of piano strings these are normally neglected. Some recent reports have suggested that all four traveling waves should be considered, at least at the neighborhood of interaction points (i.e., the hammer and the boundaries). This paper investigates the effect of omitting string stiffness in the context of sound synthesis of the piano by physical modeling. A stiff, lossy string with a spatially distributed hammer force excitation is implemented using both a finite-difference time-domain scheme and a digital waveguide model. The two models are designed so as to have the exact same features but for the two stiffness-related solutions. Numerical experiments are employed to study the contact force and string velocity signals for different initial hammer velocity values. The results generally confirm that the two fast-decaying waves have only a marginal effect on the overall string motion. However, small audible differences result for bass strings struck with high initial hammer velocities.},

@article{2009SchneiderNeural,
author = {Peter Schneider and Martina Wengenroth},
abstract = {With respect to enormous inter-individual differences in sound perception, this article aims to review the research background of the neural basis of individual sound perception. Principally, two basic listening types can be distinguished: 'holistic' or 'synthetic' listeners recognize the sound as a whole, and appreciate its pitch and timbre as characteristic qualities of the entire sound; and 'spectral' or 'analytical' listeners break up the sound into its harmonic constituents, at the expense of timbral qualities of the sound as a whole. In-between these two extreme listening modes, intermediate listeners perceive holistic and spectral cues simultaneously to varying degrees (auditory ambiguity). Several recent neurological investigations have pinpointed these perceptual differences to neuroanatomical and neurophysiological measures of the auditory cortex. Furthermore, it has been shown that individual auditory perception bias corresponds to musical instrument preference and musical performance style. Multimodal research findings point towards an individual 'fingerprint' of auditory cortex and perception profiles; however, whether these properties are shaped by intense training or rather reflect innate, genetically determined predisposition remains a matter of unresolved debate. \textcopyright2009 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Probability, Markov Chains, Queues, and Simulationprovides a modern and authoritative treatment of the mathematical processes that underlie performance modeling. The detailed explanations of mathematical derivations and numerous illustrative examples make this textbook readily accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students taking courses in which stochastic processes play a fundamental role. The textbook is relevant to a wide variety of fields, including computer science, engineering, operations research, statistics, and mathematics.The textbook looks at the fundamentals of probability theory, from the basic concepts of set-based probability, through probability distributions, to bounds, limit theorems, and the laws of large numbers. Discrete and continuous-time Markov chains are analyzed from a theoretical and computational point of view. Topics include the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations; irreducibility; the potential, fundamental, and reachability matrices; random walk problems; reversibility; renewal processes; and the numerical computation of stationary and transient distributions. The M/M/1 queue and its extensions to more general birth-death processes are analyzed in detail, as are queues with phase-type arrival and service processes. The M/G/1 and G/M/1 queues are solved using embedded Markov chains; the busy period, residual service time, and priority scheduling are treated. Open and closed queueing networks are analyzed. The final part of the book addresses the mathematical basis of simulation.Each chapter of the textbook concludes with an extensive set of exercises. An instructor's solution manual, in which all exercises are completely worked out, is also available (to professors only).Numerous examples illuminate the mathematical theoriesCarefully detailed explanations of mathematical derivations guarantee a valuable pedagogical approachEach chapter concludes with an extensive set of exercisesProfessors: A supplementary Solutions Manual is available for this book.

abstract = {Plastics have transformed everyday life; usage is increasing and annual production is likely to exceed 300 million tonnes by 2010. In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in plastic, the leaching of chemicals from plastic products and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded. \textcopyright2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {In this work the effect of two different bridge conﬁgurations on the vibrations of the top plate of a classical guitar is presented. Experimental harmonic analysis and visualization techniques, in addition to detailed damped simulations using the ﬁnite element method, were used to obtain mobility functions and operating deﬂection shapes of a top plate. The mobility functions were obtained in the following sequence. First the mobility functions were obtained on the top plate without a bridge attached. Then a bridge was glued to the top plate and new measurements were made. Finally the already attached bridge was cross-cut in situ without detaching it from the top plate, and the measurements were repeated. Those speciﬁc designs were chosen on the grounds of simplicity of construction both experimentally and in FEM simulations (no particular preference for those designs is implied). The assembly and the speciﬁc design of the bridge have shown to have considerable inﬂuence on the response of the top plate regarding the mode shapes above 300 Hz. Depending on the geometry of the bridge, its deﬂections can either be comparable to the maximum deﬂections of the top plate or can have amplitudes so small that the bridge effectively creates a nodal zone on the plate vibrations. This suggests that the shape, the stiffness, and the mass properties of the bridge may play a role in the sound quality of the instrument. \'O 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have recently been the focus of attention as a biodegradable and biocompatible substitute for conventional non degradable plastics. The cost of large-scale production of these polymers has inhibited its widespread use. Thus, economical, large-scale production of PHAs is currently being studied intensively. Various bacterial strains, either wild-type or recombinant have been utilized with a wide spectrum of utilizable carbon sources. New fermentation strategies have been developed for the efficient production of PHAs at high concentration and productivity. With the current advances, PHAs can now be produced to a concentration of 80 g L-1 with productivities greater than 4 g PHA L-1 h-1. These advanceswill further lower the production cost of PHAs and allow this family of polymers to become a leading biodegradable polymer in the near future. This review describes the properties of PHAs, their uses, the various attempts towards the production of PHAs, focusing on the utilization of cheap substrates and the development of different fermentation strategies for the production of these polymers, an essential step forward towards their widespread use. \textcopyright2010 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract = {Multiplicative noise (also known as speckle noise) models are central to the study of coherent imaging systems, such as synthetic aperture radar and sonar, and ultrasound and laser imaging. These models introduce two additional layers of difficulties with respect to the standard Gaussian additive noise scenario: 1) the noise is multiplied by (rather than added to) the original image; 2) the noise is not Gaussian, with Rayleigh and Gamma being commonly used densities. These two features of multiplicative noise models preclude the direct application of most state-of-the-art algorithms, which are designed for solving unconstrained optimization problems where the objective has two terms: a quadratic data term (log-likelihood), reflecting the additive and Gaussian nature of the noise, plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer (e.g., a total variation or wavelet-based regularizer/prior). In this paper, we address these difficulties by: 1) converting the multiplicative model into an additive one by taking logarithms, as proposed by some other authors; 2) using variable splitting to obtain an equivalent constrained problem; and 3) dealing with this optimization problem using the augmented Lagrangian framework. A set of experiments shows that the proposed method, which we name MIDAL (multiplicative image denoising by augmented Lagrangian), yields state-of-the-art results both in terms of speed and denoising performance. \textcopyright2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Physics of Music and Color deals with two subjects, music and\ncolor - sound and light in the physically objective sense - in a\nsingle volume. The basic underlying physical principles of the two\nsubjects overlap greatly: both music and color are manifestations\nof wave phenomena, and commonalities exist as to the production,\ntransmission, and detection of sound and light. This book aids readers\nin studying both subjects, which involve nearly the entire gamut\nof the fundamental laws of classical as well as modern physics. Where\ntraditional introductory physics and courses are styled so that the\nbasic principles are introduced first and are then applied wherever\npossible, this book is based on a motivational approach: it introduces\na subject by demonstrating a set of related phenomena, challenging\nreaders by calling for a physical basis for what is observed. The\nbook is based upon a course on the physics of music and color that\nhas been taught at Tufts University since 1973, when the course was\nintroduced by Gary Goldstein and the author.\n\nTopics that are unusual for a book at this level and breadth include:\na detailed non-mathematical summary of the principles of electricity\nand magnetism with the goal of understanding the basis for various\naudio devices as well as the physical essence of light and how it\npropagates as a wave; extensive details on the calculation of color\ncoordinates from a spectral intensity with different choices of primaries;\nthe relationship between color coordinates on a computer and the\ncolor seen on a monitor. References to recent developments include\nthe connection between the blueness of the ocean and the psycho-acoustic\nperception of combination tones in a sound wave. A major goal is\nto provide an understanding of basic principles, both conceptual\nand quantitative, that will allow the reader to have increased awareness\nof audial and visual experiences and to understand phenomena not\ndiscussed in the book.\n\nThe Physics of Music and Color is written at a level suitable for\ncollege students without any scientific background, requiring only\nsimple algebra and a passing familiarity with trigonometry. It contains\nnumerous problems at the end of each chapter that help the reader\nto fully grasp the subject. The book can also serve as a reference\nof basic principles for those involved in sound production and color\nmanagement.},

abstract = {Industrial design attempts to enhance quality of life by designing products that meet consumer requirements. Combining concepts from various fields, including design, computer technology, aesthetics, and economics, industrial designers seek to improve quality of life by designing products that meet consumer needs. Industrial designers focus on customers' perceptions of products and their preferences for certain shapes, textures, colors, styles, linguistic variables, prices, and functions. Because new products are continuously being released, manufacturers must continually design products to satisfy customer needs to avoid displacement by market competitors. When planning strategies for marketing products to various users and consumers, managers must often consider multiple combinations of product shapes and must design products that cater to consumer tastes to minimize the risk of their products being rejected by the market. Companies with highly-skilled designers have more ideas, better and more competitive products, and shorter production times than companies with weak designers. This study analyzed product styles by applying genetic algorithms and Kansei Engineering Type II (AHP and Quantification Theory Type I). This research transforms the psychological conceptions of consumers into linguistic variables. A MATLAB program was constructed to enable designers to simulate consumer logic. The cognitive dissonance between virtual and real models was minimized by using a 3D CAD model, and the virtual model of optimum solutions in this study employed a rapid prototyping machine to generate real models efficiently. Future genetic algorithm models applying different decision theories may achieve even faster and more accurate results. Relevance to industry: Component diversification enables rapid improvement in product competitiveness. This study proposes a support model that conforms to the psychological preferences of consumers by applying a genetic algorithm method. Therefore, the model is applicable to electronic commerce websites or to other unmanned shops. \textcopyright2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging applications of time-frequency representations deals with the analysis of the signal issued from natural environment. Recently, the interest for passive underwater context increased, basically due to the rich information carried out by the natural signals. Taken into account the non-linear multi-component time-frequency behavior of such signals, their analysis is a complex problem. In this paper we introduce a new time-frequency analysis concept that aims to extract the non-linear time-frequency components. The main feature of this technique is the joint use of time-amplitude, time-frequency and time-phase information. This is materialized by a short-time polynomial phase modeling and the fusion of local information according to the best locally matches of local cubic frequency modulations. Tests provided on real data illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach. \textcopyright2010 IEEE.},

@book{2010LaiIntroduction,
author = {David Rubin and Erhard Krempl},
abstract = {Continuum Mechanics is a branch of physical mechanics that describes the macroscopic mechanical behavior of solid or fluid materials considered to be continuously distributed. It is fundamental to the fields of civil, mechanical, chemical and bioengineering. This time-tested text has been used for over 35 years to introduce junior and senior-level undergraduate engineering students, as well as graduate students, to the basic principles of continuum mechanics and their applications to real engineering problems. The text begins with a detailed presentation of the coordinate invariant quantity, the tensor, introduced as a linear transformation. This is then followed by the formulation of the kinematics of deformation, large as well as very small, the description of stresses and the basic laws of continuum mechanics. As applications of these laws, the behaviors of certain material idealizations (models) including the elastic, viscous and viscoelastic materials, are presented.This new edition offers expanded coverage of the subject matter both in terms of details and contents, providing greater flexibility for either a one or two-semester course in either continuum mechanics or elasticity. Although this current edition has expanded the coverage of the subject matter, it nevertheless uses the same approach as that in the earlier editions - that one can cover advanced topics in an elementary way that go from simple to complex, using a wealth of illustrative examples and problems. It is, and will remain, one of the most accessible textbooks on this challenging engineering subject. Significantly expanded coverage of elasticity in Chapter 5, including solutions of some 3-D problems based on the fundamental potential functions approach.New section at the end of Chapter 4 devoted to the integral formulation of the field equationsSeven new appendices appear at the end of the relevant chapters to help make each chapter more self-containedExpanded and improved problem sets providing both intellectual challenges and engineering applications. \textcopyright2010 Elsevier Inc.

This acoustic model describes the propagation of longitudinal waves in axisymmetric acoustic pipes with a varying cross-section, visco-thermal losses at the walls, and without assuming planar or spherical waves. Moreover, three types of discontinuities of the shape can be taken into account (radius, slope, and curvature). The purpose of this work is to build low-cost digital simulations in the time domain based on the WebsterLokshin model. First, decomposing a resonator into independent elementary parts and isolating delay operators lead to a KellyLochbaum network of input/output systems and delays. Second, for a systematic assembling of elements, their statespace representations are derived in discrete time. Then, standard tools of automatic control are used to reduce the complexity of digital simulations in the time domain. The method is applied to a real trombone, and results of simulations are presented and compared with measurements. This method seems to be a promising approach in term of modularity, complexity of calculation, and accuracy, for any acoustic resonators based on tubes. \textcopyright2010 IEEE.},

Now Mixerman turns his razor-sharp gaze to the art of mixing and gives followers and the uninitiated reason to hope if not for logic and civility in the recording studio then at least for a good sounding record. With a firm commitment to art over technology and to maintaining a grasp of each, Mixerman outlines his own approach to recording success, based on his years mixing records in all genres of music for all kinds of artists, often under trying circumstances. As he states in his introduction to the new volume, "Even if you're not a professional mixer, even if you're a musician trying to mix your own work or a studio owner in a smaller market, you have your own set of pressures to deal with while you're mixing. Regardless of what those pressures are, it's important to identify and recognize them, if for no other reason than so you can learn to completely ignore them." But how?

The authors focus on shape interrogation of geometric models bounded by free-form surfaces. Free-form surfaces, also called sculptured surfaces, are widely used in the bodies of ships, automobiles and aircraft, which have both functionality and attractive shape requirements. Many electronic devices as well as consumer products are designed with aesthetic shapes, which involve free-form surfaces. This book provides the mathematical fundamentals as well as algorithms for various shape interrogation methods. From the reviews: "This book provides the mathematical fundamentals as well as algorithms for various shape interrogation methods including nonlinear polynomial solvers, intersection problems, differential geometry of intersection curves, distance functions, curve and surface interrogation, umbilics and lines of curvature, geodesics, and offset curves and surfaces. [... ] It may well be one of the most important books of the 2002s that has been written on shape interrogation for graduate students in mathematics, engineering, computer science, focusing on geometrical modeling and solid modeling. The book will inform and enlighten professionals in industry and therefore remains essential reading for them too. Currently there are several excellent books in the area of geometric modeling and in the area of solid modeling. The major contribution of this book lies in its skilful manner of providing a bridge between these two areas that is guaranteed to make the target audience cry out aloud with delight." Current Engineering Practice 2002-2003, Vol. 45, Issue 3-4 "This book gives a detailed description of algorithms and computational methods for shape interrogation [... ] The book can be used in a course for advanced graduate students and also as a reference text for researchers and practitioners in CAD/CAM.

abstract = {This study evaluates the efficacy of green design principles such as the "12 Principles of Green Chemistry," and the "12 Principles of Green Engineering" with respect to environmental impacts found using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. A case study of 12 polymers is presented, seven derived from petroleum, four derived from biological sources, and one derived from both. The environmental impacts of each polymer's production are assessed using LCA methodology standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Each polymer is also assessed for its adherence to green design principles using metrics generated specifically for this paper. Metrics include atom economy, mass from renewable sources, biodegradability, percent recycled, distance of furthest feedstock, price, life cycle health hazards and life cycle energy use. A decision matrix is used to generate single value metrics for each polymer evaluating either adherence to green design principles or life-cycle environmental impacts. Results from this study show a qualified positive correlation between adherence to green design principles and a reduction of the environmental impacts of production. The qualification results from a disparity between biopolymers and petroleum polymers. While biopolymers rank highly in terms of green design, they exhibit relatively large environmental impacts from production. Biopolymers rank 1, 2, 3, and 4 based on green design metrics; however they rank in the middle of the LCA rankings. Polyolefins rank 1, 2, and 3 in the LCA rankings, whereas complex polymers, such as PET, PVC, and PC place at the bottom of both ranking systems. \textcopyright2010 American Chemical Society.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The aim of the study was to identify key elements to comprehend the systemic structure of interaction among the ties of this chain. The study was held by a team of specialists over five months, including 15 meetings. Discussions were based on quantitative and qualitative data and a systemic map was constructed and refined. Based on this modeling, four different prospective scenarios were comparatively analyzed in order to propose strategic actions to promote the sustainability and competitiveness of the chain. The results were then presented to two different groups of external specialists in order to validate the conclusions drawn and the proposals. Both groups agreed with the ideas presented. The paper is constructed as follows: a brief introduction focusing on contextual elements of the biodiesel production in Brazil and in Rio Grande do Sul; some background material regarding agroindustrial production chains and an overview of the biodiesel production chain of interest; a description of the method used to perform the research; main results and discussion; and conclusions. With this paper the authors also hope to contribute to the discussion regarding competitiveness and sustainability of biofuel chains in Brazil. \textcopyright2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning for partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) is a challenge as it requires policies with an internal state. Traditional approaches suffer significantly from this shortcoming and usually make strong assumptions on the problem domain such as perfect system models, state-estimators and a Markovian hidden system. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offer a natural framework for dealing with policy learning using hidden state and require only few limiting assumptions. As they can be trained well using gradient descent, they are suited for policy gradient approaches. In this paper, we present a policy gradient method, the Recurrent Policy Gradient which constitutes a model-free reinforcement learning method. It is aimed at training limited-memory stochastic policies on problems which require long-term memories of past observations. The approach involves approximating a policy gradient for a recurrent neural network by backpropagating return-weighted characteristic eligibilities through time. Using a "Long Short-Term Memory" RNN architecture, we are able to outperform previous RL methods on three important benchmark tasks. Furthermore, we show that using history-dependent baselines helps reducing estimation variance significantly, thus enabling our approach to tackle more challenging, highly stochastic environments. \textcopyrightThe Author 2009.

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations. \textcopyright2011 IEEE.},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate product form design in terms of the perspectives of Gestalt psychology and Minimalist principles. Unlike traditional AHP methods, the proposed decision-making model uses distinct mathematical tools to establish priorities for the criteria and synthesize the evaluation results. A case study was conducted to illustrate the practicability of this proposed model. It has shown a credible result. In addition to product form design, this model can be applied to related design fields, such as plane design and other visual design. Relevance to industry: Product form design is a creative process that involves complex visual perceptions. It is very important to develop an effective decision support system for designers to deal with problems concerning the consumers' psychological preferences toward product forms. As Gestalt psychology and Minimalist principles provide an important perspective on visual perception, it is appropriate to apply these principles in assessing the quality of product form design. \textcopyright2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The main result of this thesis is an eﬀective method to extend Karr's symbolic summation framework to algebraic extensions. These arise, for example, when working with expressions involving (−1)n. An implementation of this method, including a modernised version of Karr's algorithm is also presented. Karr's algorithm is the summation analogue of the Risch algorithm for indeﬁnite integration. In the summation case, towers of specialized diﬀerence ﬁelds called $\Pi$$\Sigma$-ﬁelds are used to model nested sums and products. This is similar to the way elementary functions involving nested logarithms and exponentials are represented in diﬀerential ﬁelds in the integration case. In contrast to the integration framework, only transcendental extensions are allowed in Karr's construction. Algebraic extensions of $\Pi$$\Sigma$-ﬁelds can even be rings with zero divisors. Karr's methods rely heavily on the ability to solve ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerence equations and they are no longer applicable over these rings. Based on Bronstein's formulation of a method used by Singer for the solution of diﬀerential equations over algebraic extensions, we transform a ﬁrst-order linear equation over an algebraic extension to a system of ﬁrst-order equations over a purely transcendental extension ﬁeld. However, this domain is not necessarily a $\Pi$$\Sigma$-ﬁeld. Using a structure theorem by Singer and van der Put, we reduce this system to a single ﬁrst-order equation over a $\Pi$$\Sigma$-ﬁeld, which can be solved by Karr's algorithm. We also describe how to construct towers of diﬀerence ring extensions on an algebraic extension, where the same reduction methods can be used. A common bottleneck for symbolic summation algorithms is the computation of nullspaces of matrices over rational function ﬁelds. We present a fast algorithm for matrices over Q(x) which uses fast arithmetic at the hardware level with calls to BLAS subroutines after modular reduction. This part is joint work with Arne Storjohann.},

This model arises in resource allocation problems that permit or require sequential allocation decisions in a probabilistic setting. One particular application is in obsolescence inventory management. In this paper, the adaptive SKP is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem for discrete random rewards. The paper also presents a heuristic that mixes adaptive and static policies to overcome the "curse of dimensionality" in the DP. The proposed heuristic is extended to problems with normally distributed random rewards. The heuristic can solve large problems quickly, and its solution always outperforms a static policy. The numerical study indicates that a near-optimal solution can be obtained by using an algorithm with limited look-ahead capabilities. \textcopyright2011 INFORMS.},

abstract = {"Mathematics can be as effortless as humming a tune, if you know the tune," writes Gareth Loy. In Musimathics, Loy teaches us the tune, providing a friendly and spirited tour of the mathematics of musica commonsense, self-contained introduction for the nonspecialist reader. It is designed for musicians who find their art increasingly mediated by technology, and for anyone who is interested in the intersection of art and science. In this volume, Loy presents the materials of music (notes, intervals, and scales); the physical properties of music (frequency, amplitude, duration, and timbre); the perception of music and sound (how we hear); and music composition. Musimathics is carefully structured so that new topics depend strictly on topics already presented, carrying the reader progressively from basic subjects to more advanced ones. Cross-references point to related topics and an extensive glossary defines commonly used terms. The book explains the mathematics and physics of music for the reader whose mathematics may not have gone beyond the early undergraduate level. Calling himself "a composer seduced into mathematics," Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The topics are all subjects that contemporary composers, musicians, and musical engineers have found to be important. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio. The level of scholarship and the pedagogical approach also make Musimathics ideal for classroom use. Additional material can be found at a companion web site.},

abstract = {Michel Waisvisz's The Hands is one of the most famous and long-lasting research projects in the literature of digital music instruments. Consisting of a pair of data gloves and exhibited for the first time in 1984, The Hands is a pioneering work in digital devices for performing live music. It is a work that engaged Waisvisz for almost a quarter of a century and, in turn, has inspired many generations of music technologists and performers of live music. Despite being often cited in the relevant literature, however, the documentation concerning the sensor architecture, design, mapping strategies, and development of these data gloves is sparse. In this article, we aim to fill this gap by offering a detailed history behind the development of The Hands. The information contained in this article was retrieved and collated by searching the STEIM archive, interviewing close collaborators of Waisvisz, and browsing through the paper documentation found in his personal folders and office.},

abstract = {Decision makers are often faced with several conflicting alternatives. How do they evaluate trade-offs when there are more than three criteria? To help people make optimal decisions, scholars in the discipline of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) continue to develop new methods for structuring preferences and determining the correct relative weights for criteria. A compilation of modern decision-making techniques, Multiple Attribute Decision Making: Methods and Applications focuses on the fuzzy set approach to multiple attribute decision making (MADM). Drawing on their experience, the authors bring together current methods and real-life applications of MADM techniques for decision analysis. They also propose a novel hybrid MADM model that combines DEMATEL and analytic network process (ANP) with VIKOR procedures. The first part of the book focuses on the theory of each method and includes examples that can be calculated without a computer, providing a complete understanding of the procedures. Methods include the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), ANP, simple additive weighting method, ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, the gray relational model, fuzzy integral technique, rough sets, and the structural model. Integrating theory and practice, the second part of the book illustrates how methods can be used to solve real-world MADM problems. Applications covered in the book include: • AHP to select planning and design services for a construction project • TOPSIS and VIKOR to evaluate the best alternative-fuel vehicles for urban areas • ELECTRE to solve network design problems in urban transportation planning • PROMETEE to set priorities for the development of new energy systems, from solar thermal to hydrogen energy • Fuzzy integrals to evaluate enterprise intranet web sites • Rough sets to make decisions in insurance marketing Helping readers understand how to apply MADM techniques to their decision making, this book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students as well as practitioners.},

This theory plays a central role in explaining the stability of mechanical structures in civil engineering, but it also has applications in other fields such as electrical network systems and quantum mechanics. This volume gives an introduction to linear finite dimensional damped systems as they are viewed by an applied mathematician. After a short overview of the physical principles leading to the linear systems model, a largely self-contained mathematical theory for this model is presented. this includes the geometry of the underlying indefinite eigenvalue problem. Particular attention is paid to the sensitivity issues which influence numerical computations. finally, several recent research developments are included, e.g. Lyapunov stability and the perturbation of the time evolution."--P.

abstract = {In recent years, much attention has been focused on research to replace petroleum-based commodity plastics, in a cost-effective manner, with biodegradable materials offering competitive mechanical properties. Biopolymers have been considered as the most promising materials for this purpose. However, they generally present poor mechanical properties regarding processability and end-use application, since the fragility and brittleness exhibited during thermoformation can limit their potential for application. In order to overcome this problem, plasticizers are added to provide the necessary workability to biopolymers. This class of products became more visible when biodegradable additives and plasticizers also became the focus of material scientists. The use of natural and/or biodegradable plasticizers, with low toxicity and good compatibility with several plastics, resins, rubber and elastomers in substitution of conventional plasticizers, such as phthalates and other synthetic conventional plasticizers attracted the market along with the increasing worldwide trend towards use of biopolymers. Here we discuss the main results and developments in natural plasticizer/synthetic and biopolymer-based films during the last decades. \textcopyright2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

author = {Robert Bruce},
abstract = {This is the fabulous FIRST EDITION of Astral DynamicsThe first edition of Astral Dynamics (the book you are now reading about) contains a great deal of content that was dropped from the 2009 second edition to save space. These are essentially two quite different books. Most people want both these amazing books, so we convinced Robert Bruce to produce an eBook version of the original First Edition of Astral Dynamics, with full color illustrations and other improvements. This First Edition went out of print in 2009. THE FIRST EDITION OF ASTRAL DYNAMICS - In one fascinating volume, Robert Bruce gathered together a personal narrative, a "how-to", a troubleshooting guide, and a theoretical perspective on the nonphysical structure underlying the strange and multidimensional life we all lead. Whether you are a skeptic, a veteran astral projector, a newbie, or an armchair traveler, there's treasure here. It's in a class by itself. What he says here rings true. In fact, it does a lot more than ring true. It opens doors. Astral Dynamics provides the intelligent and motivated reader with everything needed to put theory into practice. The book's six parts may be read each on their own, but they have been placed to build nicely one upon the other. Part One, "Elements of Projection", presents Robert's theory of what actually goes on when the projectable astral double leaves the physical body. This in itself, right out of the gate, is fascinating terrain. His theory of the consequences of the mind-split that results from projection is itself worth the price of the book. Part Two, "NEW Energy Ways", presents his stunningly practical method of raising energy and awareness by using touch, which he calls Tactile Imaging. I have tried this method on half a dozen people, selected more or less at random, each of whom obtained the desired awareness within seconds! And then, as if the new method of visualization weren't enough, Robert proceeds to describe the nature and anatomy of our energy bodies, a description firmly rooted in his own personal explorations. Part Three, "Core Skills", builds on this foundation, demonstrating how to succeed at the three tasks that are essential to success in astral projection: deep physical relaxation, taming the mind, and attaining the trance state. Part Four, "Projection Exit and Technique", tells you what you need to know to stop reading about astral projection and actually do it. Part Five, "The Akashic Connection", proceeds into the realm of the theoretical, not for the sake of getting lost in theory, but in order to make sense of things seen and heard. Particularly interesting is Robert's description of the nature and meaning of what he calls the Akashic Pulse. As to his description and analysis of the astral planes, the silver cord, the etheric body, and the Akashic record — I doubt that these have been equaled anywhere in the subject's extensive modern literature. I am confident that they have not been excelled. Part Six, "Strange Astral Phenomena", takes on a few conundrums that are worth exploring. Projection into higher realms; reality fluctuations; astral noise; what Robert calls astral wildlife, and astral combat... he covers the turf as it hasn't been covered to date. And he does it so casually, in so unpretentious a manner, his mood ranging from deepest awe to casually joking, with all the range between. If you have any interest at all in the subject of astral projection, lucid dreaming — higher consciousness in general — you're going to love this book. I predict that it will become a classic, read and valued for many years to come.

Originally introduced by Sergei Natanovich Bernstein to facilitate a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, the leisurely convergence rate of Bernstein polynomial approximations to continuous functions caused them to languish in obscurity, pending the advent of digital computers. With the desire to exploit the power of computers for geometric design applications, however, the Bernstein form began to enjoy widespread use as a versatile means of intuitively constructing and manipulating geometric shapes, spurring further development of basic theory, simple and efficient recursive algorithms, recognition of its excellent numerical stability properties, and an increasing diversification of its repertoire of applications.

abstract = {Humans and animals face decision tasks in an uncertain multi-agent environment where an agent's strategy may change in time due to the co-adaptation of others strategies. The neuronal substrate and the computational algorithms underlying such adaptive decision making, however, is largely unknown. We propose a population coding model of spiking neurons with a policy gradient procedure that successfully acquires optimal strategies for classical game-theoretical tasks. The suggested population reinforcement learning reproduces data from human behavioral experiments for the blackjack and the inspector game. It performs optimally according to a pure (deterministic) and mixed (stochastic) Nash equilibrium, respectively. In contrast, temporal-difference(TD)-learning, covariance-learning, and basic reinforcement learning fail to perform optimally for the stochastic strategy. Spike-based population reinforcement learning, shown to follow the stochastic reward gradient, is therefore a viable candidate to explain automated decision learning of a Nash equilibrium in two-player games. \textcopyright 2012 Friedrich, Senn.},

abstract = {While the definition of the 'genotype' has undergone dramatic changes in the transition from classical to molecular genetics, the definition of the 'phenotype' has remained for a long time within the classical framework. In addition, while the notion of the genotype has received significant attention from philosophers of biology, the notion of the phenotype has not. Recent developments in the technology of measuring gene-expression levels have made it possible to conceive of phenotypic traits in terms of levels of gene expression. We demonstrate that not only has this become possible but it has also become an actual practice. This suggests a significant change in our conception of the phenotype: as in the case of the 'genotype', phenotypes can now be conceived in quantitative and measurable terms on a comprehensive molecular level. We discuss in what sense gene expression profiles can be regarded as phenotypic traits and whether these traits are better described as a novel concept of phenotype or as an extension of the classical concept. We argue for an extension of the classical concept and call for an examination of the type of extension involved. \textcopyright2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, the deployment of sustainable product design has led to a dramatic increase in the use of bio-plastics as an environmentally sensitive substitute to regular petroleum-based ones. Published literature has explored the environmental performance and their suitability as an alternative for regular plastics. However, the reception of these materials by users, who come into contact with these materials embodied in consumer products, has not been researched and published. Even though the principle of using such materials with improved environmental credentials is sound, it is down to the users' appreciation of those materials that ultimately determine their commercial success. A significant challenge faced by material developers and product designers is to facilitate the appraisal of bio-plastics as a natural alternative to regular plastics, whilst at the same time meeting users' perceptions of quality. Drawing on the results of an empirical study this paper discusses when a material is perceived as 'natural' and/or 'high- quality'. The study concludes that there are more contradictory aspects than congruent aspects when evoking these two meanings. Imposition of new aesthetic values and uniqueness are discussed as critical strategies to elicit the desired meanings. \textcopyright2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {The Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster (SBPSC), Offshore Southeast Brazil, is a unique scenario, posing great development challenges. The microbial carbonate reservoir is unusual regarding its origin and petrophysical properties; the fluids have a variable CO2 content; the few analogue reservoirs around the world do not compare in terms of volumes, water depth and distance to the coast; and there are also flow assurance issues. Considering the importance of these reserves for the Brazilian economy and the opportunity to accelerate cash flow, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a fast track development, including extended well tests (EWTs) and production pilots. The current Petrobras Business Plan (2011-15) foresees mat the SBPSC areas alone will produce over 500,000 boe/d in 2015 and over 1,100,000 boe/d in 2020. These numbers refer only to Petrobras share and do not include me transfer of rights with economic compensation from the Brazilian government to Petrobras. Therefore, the initial development phase will have to cope with several uncertainties, mainly the subsurface ones. Some of the most relevant are the quality and the heterogeneity degree of each reservoir zone; the compositional grading of the fluids; the performance of different EOR methods; and the presence of fractures affecting the flow. How to specify and anticipate the acquisition of expensive equipment, such as FPSOs and subsea devices, with uncertainties to be clarified? When is it worth to invest in more data acquisition, such as EWTs, core and fluid sampling, extensive lab analysis or even more appraisal wells? The timing and the uncertainty reduction foreseen for each initiative must be taken into account. On the other hand, when is it better to pay for extra flexibilities, accepting the inevitable CAPEX increase? Some examples would be: smart completions and possibility to inject different chemical products in the wells; gas and water separated lines for each satellite injector; flexible subsea layout, allowing multiples strategies and the addition of more wells; FPSO plants designed to inject desulphated water, or to export, import or reinject me gas, and also to separate variable CO2 contents in the produced fluids. This paper aims to discuss the influence of the main subsurface uncertainties in the selection of alternatives to develop the giant fields in the SBPSC, in a fast track way.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Carbonate reservoirs contain expressive part of the world oil reserves. The exploitation of these resources, however, presents several challenges mainly associated with their complex pore geometry, large scale variation in permeability and sometimes unfavorable wettability. These challenges can become more significant when we move to a deep offshore environment. As offshore projects need to be planned well in advance, due to the lack of room in the platforms for future expansion, the pioneer application of EOR methods needs to be considered from the conceptual stage of the development. This paper addresses the approach used to design the development basis for Lula field, formerly known as Tupi area, in the Pre-Salt Cluster (SBPSC) in Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. It focuses on the strategy of phased development, dynamic data acquisition and actions to add flexibility to the production system and how to manage uncertainties. A comprehensive analysis of the existing uncertainties, such as the reservoir characterization, early water and gas breakthrough, bypassed oil saturation, flow assurance in deep water flowlines and CaCO 3 scale possibility in production wells, favored a phased development concept aiming to mitigate risks.. The approach used to cope with these uncertainties in a Pilot Project as well as in the future development scenarios is presented. Most of the discussion is focused on how to consider feasible Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques through Pilot testing and future implementation in large scale in the field. It comprises the investigation of different recovery processes and first field results, including miscible processes using hydrocarbon gas and CO2. To optimize the oil displacement, a water alternating gas (WAG) injection process is also being designed. After one and a half year of extended well test production and the implementation of the first Pilot project in January, 2011, results confirm the decision of providing additional flexibility to the project. Dynamic appraisal proved essential to assess reservoir connectivity, evaluate stimulation methods, support reservoir characterization studies and define aspects related to flow in subsea lines. The first results of the injection of the CO2 stream, separated from the associated gas in the Pilot project, indicate that the chosen strategy has potential to be a successful one. The continuing production and pressure data monitoring of the WAG implementation in the Pilot, from 2012 on, will provide a more definitive conclusion about the feasibility. Good responses will translate in the EOR expansion to field scale. Copyright 2012, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

These financial ratios and the discriminant Z-score in the MDA form the input for the SOM, which creates a hybrid MDA-SOM model that is capable of predicting corporate financial insolvency. The experimental results of this research correctly estimate company financial health in 95% of cases. These are reliable predictions that are comparable with similar studies in other countries. \textcopyrightThe Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is to describe complex theoretical concepts about vibration and acoustics, considering experimental and computational tools. Some modal behaviors of a structure were explained. First, an experiment was designed to naked eye visualization of mode shapes in a thin film. Later, simulated deflections of a guitar top plate model were explored. This exploration was done through original scientific visualization software. Moreover, the developed computational tool was essential illustrating behaviors that used to be hard to visualize: acoustic waves. Sound radiation data were calculated from the vibration of the top plate model. These data were sliced to detect acoustic wavefronts and directivity patterns. Experimental and computational procedures developed in this work were useful illustrating vibroacoustic behaviors. Mode shapes and natural frequencies in the thin film experiment were clearly detected. Scientific visualization software showed ability to display vibroacoustic information in high density, with much semantic substance and time savings. The experiment can be easily implemented in a classroom, and the software can be used to explore other kind of data in standard Visualization Tool Kit format.},

abstract = {A platform for manipulation and examination the acoustic guitar is presented, based on a novel guitar design - the Chameleon Guitar - featuring a replaceable acoustic resonator functioning as the soundboard of the instrument. The goal of the design process is to create a tone as sonically close to that of a traditional guitar as possible, while maintaining an easily replaceable soundboard. An iterative, data driven approach was used, each design step coming under examination from one or more measurement tools: finite-element method, acoustic impulse testing, and laser vibrometry. Ideal resonator geometry, bridge location, and piezoelectric sensor positions were determined. The finished instrument was then examined with laser vibrometry to confirm earlier results, evaluate the behavior and chosen sensor positions for various tonewoods, and examine the acoustic effects of adding sensors and wax finish. The conclusions drawn are diverse and point to the significance of attention to detail in each step of instrument construction. For example, when changing instrument material from one softwood to another, ideal locations for piezoelectric sensors are subject to change. We conclude that detailed acoustic analysis can significantly aid in the construction of new instruments by quantifying the impact of instrument geometry and material properties. \textcopyright2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the importance of credit ratings assigned to banks in Europe and the positive and negative impacts. We will also see Albanian Banking system over the last 5 years focusing on the risks it faces. The aim of this article is to analyze and identify the importance of Banks' Rating. Actually, banks are the dominant sector within Albanian financial system, managing more than 95.5% of total financial assets. Although banks sometimes use internal models as a substitute for credit ratings for their credit assessments, the internal models themselves often tend to rely heavily on ratings for actual or methodological input. Investors' reliance on credit ratings has increased over the past 30 years. Acquiring information is costly, particularly for fixed income investors, given collective action problems. Thus investors seek to outsource creditworthiness assessments to rating agencies. Finally we will see if there is a need of Banks Rating in Albanian's Banks, the requirements of Basel III and the regulatory of the Bank of Albania.},

abstract = {Software startups are more popular than ever and growing in numbers. They operate under conditions of extreme uncertainty and face many challenges. Often, agile development practices and lean principles are suggested as ways to increase the odds of succeeding as a startup, as they both advocate close customer collaboration and short feedback cycles focusing on delivering direct customer value. However, based on an interview study we see that despite guidance and support in terms of well-known and documented development methods, practitioners find it difficult to implement and apply these in practice. To explore this further, and to propose operational support for software startup companies, this study aims at investigating (1) what are the typical challenges when finding a product idea worth scaling, and (2) what solution would serve to address these challenges. To this end, we propose the ‘Early Stage Software Startup Development Model' (ESSSDM). The model extends already existing lean principles, but offers novel support for practitioners for investigating multiple product ideas in parallel, for determining when to move forward with a product idea, and for deciding when to abandon a product idea. The model was evaluated in a software startup project, as well as with industry professionals within the software startup domain.},

abstract = {The Iron & Steel industry is one of the biggest industrial CO2 emitters in the European Union. The present work analyzes the potential for the improvement of the energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction for this sector up to 2030. Three scenarios are analyzed: baseline scenario (BS) representing the current evolution of this sector and two alternative scenarios (AS1 and AS2) to study the sensitivity of fuel and resource prices and CO2 emission prices. In the integrated production route all the scenarios highlight the importance of breakthrough technologies, such as Top Gas Recycling, to obtain performance improvement in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In the secondary production route conditions under BS scenario are enough for a suitable incorporation of the best technologies in this route making insensitive the possible incentives due to higher prices in fuel and resources or CO2 emissions. \textcopyright2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The purpose of this investigation was to compare empirically predictive ability of an artificial neural network with a logistic regression in prediction of low back pain. Methods: Data from the second national health survey were considered in this investigation. This data includes the information of low back pain and its associated risk factors among Iranian people aged 15 years and older. Artificial neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a set of 17294 data and they were validated in a test set of 17295 data. Hosmer and Lemeshow recommendation for model selection was used in fitting the logistic regression. A three-layer perceptron with 9 inputs, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons was employed. The efficiency of two models was compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, root mean square and -2 Loglikelihood criteria. Results: The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the logistic regression was 0.752 (0.004), 0.3832 and 14769.2, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the artificial neural network was 0.754 (0.004), 0.3770 and 14757.6, respectively. Conclusions: Based on these three criteria, artificial neural network would give better performance than logistic regression. Although, the difference is statistically significant, it does not seem to be clinically significant.},

@article{2013PhilpBioplastics,
author = {Jim C Philp and Alex Bartsev and Re and Rachael J Ritchie and Marie Ange Baucher and K Guy},
abstract = {Society is fundamentally ambivalent to the use of plastics. On the one hand, plastics are uniquely flexible materials that have seen them occupy a huge range of functions, from simple packing materials to complex engineering components. On the other hand, their durability has raised concerns about their end-of-life disposal. When that disposal route is landfill, their invulnerability to microbial decomposition, combined with relatively low density and high bulk, means that plastics will occupy increasing amounts of landfill space in a world where available suitable landfill sites is shrinking.The search for biodegradable plastics and their introduction to the marketplace would appear to be a suitable amelioration strategy for such a problem. And yet the uptake of biodegradable plastics has been slow. The term biodegradable itself has entered public controversy, with accidental and intended misuse of the term; the intended misuse has led to accusations and instances of 'greenwashing'. For this and other reasons standards for biodegradability and compostability testing of plastics have been sought.An environmental dilemma with more far-reaching implications is climate change. The need for rapid and deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts is one of the drivers for the resurgence of industrial biotechnology generally, and the search for bio-based plastics more specifically. Bio-based has come to mean plastics based on renewable resources, but this need not necessarily imply biodegradability. If the primary purpose is GHG emissions savings, then once again plastics durability can be a virtue, if the end-of-life solution can be energy recovery during incineration or recycling. The pattern of production is shifting from the true biodegradable plastics to the bio-based plastics, and that trend is likely to persist into the future.This paper looks at aspects of the science of biodegradable and bio-based plastics from the perspective of policy advisers and makers. It is often said that the bioplastics suffer from a lack of a favourable policy regime when compared to the wide-ranging set of policy instruments that are available on both the supply and demand side of biofuels production. Some possible policy measures are discussed. \textcopyright2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Traditional budgeting and cost reporting is a system based on rigid frames, and it – along with the process of project cost accounting – burdens the lean and agile enterprise with unnecessary and counterproductive overhead and friction. The traditional system provides, at best, a false sense of cost control to any enterprise. In this paper we share insights related to how project-?‐based cost accounting can be transformed to a structure based on agile and lean finance and control. Our insights and examples are intended to remove a key impediment to transforming the finance function of your enterprise to something measurably more lean and agile.

abstract = {Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

The isolation of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) followed a series of steps: delignification, sulfuric acid hydrolysis, and sonication. The process afforded short, rod-like CNCs with particle diameter ranging from 10 to 12nm and crystallinity index of 76.1%. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the CNCs also confirmed absorption patterns typical of cellulose and the removal of silica. Bioplastic with different starch-to-CNC ratios were prepared by solution casting and evaporation method. Scanning electron micrographs of the films showed uniform dispersion of CNC in the starch matrix. Mechanical tests revealed that both tensile strength and modulus significantly increased with increasing CNC load while percent elongation decreased. The moisture uptake of the films reinforced with CNC also decreased an indication of improvement in water resistance. However, the thermal stability of the films decreased by the addition of CNC.},

abstract = {Collisions play an important role in many aspects of the physics of musical instruments. The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and percussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others include reed-beating efects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction in fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the wire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective, whether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or sound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various dificulties, not the least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a novel finite diference time domain simulation framework for such collision problems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical energy conservation or dissipation, and where a power law formulation for collisions is employed, as a potential function within a passive formulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and as a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of such methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are presented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation, bounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as various aspects of musical instrument physics.},

In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientiﬁc papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag "good for teaching" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag – if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is speciﬁcally scientiﬁcally oriented ("new ﬁnding").

We aim at explaining the vibratory and acoustical behavior of the piano, by taking into account the main elements that contribute to sound production. The soundboard is modeled as a bidimensional thick, orthotropic, heterogeneous, frequency dependant damped plate, using Reissner Mindlin equations. The vibroacoustics equations allow the soundboard to radiate into the surrounding air, in which we wish to compute the complete acoustical ﬁeld around the perfectly rigid rim. The soundboard is also coupled to the strings at the bridge, where they form a slight angle from the horizontal plane. Each string is modeled by a one dimensional damped system of equations, taking into account not only the transversal waves excited by the hammer, but also the stiﬀness thanks to shear waves, as well as the longitudinal waves arising from geometric nonlinearities. The hammer is given an initial velocity that projects it towards a choir of strings, before being repelled. The interacting force is a nonlinear function of the hammer compression. The ﬁnal piano model is a coupled system of partial diﬀerential equations, each of them exhibiting speciﬁc diﬃculties (nonlinear nature of the string system of equations, frequency dependant damping of the soundboard, great number of unknowns required for the acoustic propagation), in addition to couplings' inherent diﬃculties.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

However, writing is not every researcher's favourite activity, and getting a paper published can be a very tedious and time-consuming process. Fortunately, many of the obstacles along the writing and publishing path can be avoided by following some simple guidelines and practices. This paper presents a synthesis of guidelines found in literature about structuring and writing scientific papers. The paper outlines the process of publishing research papers in journals and conference proceedings, aiming to provide early-stage researchers with a handy introduction to essential issues. The paper takes an interdisciplinary stance by giving examples from technology-enhanced learning research and borrowing from literature in social, natural and computing sciences.},

@article{2014FlyvbjergWhat,
author = {Bent Flyvbjerg},
abstract = {This paper takes stock of megaproject management, an emerging and hugely costly field of study, by first answering the question of how large megaprojects are by measuring them in the units of mega, giga, and tera, and concluding with how we are presently entering a new "tera era" of trillion-dollar projects. Second, total global megaproject spending is assessed, at US$6 to US$9 trillion annually, or 8% of the total global gross domestic product (GDP), which denotes the biggest investment boom in human history. Third, four "sublimes" - political, technological, economic, and aesthetic - are identified and used to explain the increased size and frequency of megaprojects. Fourth, the "iron law of megaprojects" is laid out and documented: Over budget, over time, over and over again. Moreover, the "break-fix model" of megaproject management is introduced as an explanation of the iron law. Fifth, Albert O. Hirschman's theory of the "Hiding Hand" is revisited and critiqued as unfounded and corrupting for megaproject thinking in both the academy and policy. Sixth, it is shown how megaprojects are systematically subject to "survival of the unfittest," which explains why the worst projects get built rather than the best. Finally, it is argued that the conventional way of managing megaprojects has reached a "tension point," in which tradition is being challenged and reform is emerging. \textcopyright2014 by the Project Management Institute.},

The train- ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D; a unique solution exists; with G recovering the training data distribution andD equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G andD are defined by multilayer perceptrons; the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training or generation of samples.

abstract = {When a working set fits into memory, the overhead imposed by the buffer pool renders traditional databases noncompetitive with in-memory designs that sacrifice the benefits of a buffer pool. However, despite the large memory available with modern hardware, data skew, shifting workloads, and complex mixed workloads make it diffcult to guarantee that a working set will fit in memory. Hence, some recent work has focused on enabling in-memory databases to protect performance when the working data set almost fits in memory. Contrary to those prior efforts, we enable buffer pool designs to match in-memory performance while supporting the "big data" workloads that continue to require secondary storage, thus providing the best of both worlds. We introduce here a novel buffer pool design that adapts pointer swizzling for references between system objects (as opposed to application objects), and uses it to practically eliminate buffer pool overheads for memoryresident data. Our implementation and experimental evaluation demonstrate that we achieve graceful performance degradation when the working set grows to exceed the buffer pool size, and graceful improvement when the working set shrinks towards and below the memory and buffer pool sizes. \textcopyright2014 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract = {The aim of this review was to evaluate available evidence on the effect of early orthodontic management and myofunctional treatment in the developing dentition children, on anterior open bite correction, as well as on normalization of patterns of mouth breathing, swallowing and tongue resting position and pressure. Electronic searches in MEDLINE, Cochrane and LILACS, without language restrictions were conducted. Additionally, unpublished literature was identified. Randomized controlled trials, or controlled clinical trials, comparing interventions applied to manage anterior open bite and other muscle functions such as breathing/swallowing pattern and tongue resting position and pressure, were considered. Quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to assess treatment effects. From the 265 initial search results, 15 articles were included in the review. Eight were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 were controlled clinical trials. Treatment outcomes comprised skeletal and dentoalveolar changes recorded cephalometrically, mouth posture and lip closure normalization, improvement of tongue resting position/pressure and modification of swallowing pattern. Quantitative synthesis was possible for only 2 of the included RCTs. There was no evidence to support bonded lingual spurs over banded fixed appliances for the correction of anterior open bite in mixed dentition children presenting nonnutritive oral habits at the onset of treatment (SMD: -0.03; 95%CI: -.81, 0.74; P = 0.94). Although early orthodontic management and myofunctional treatment in the deciduous and mixed dentition children appears to be a promising approach, the quality of the existing evidence is questionable.},

By treating research as writing and writing as research, the authors offer pedagogical strategies for doctoral supervisors that will assist the production of well-argued and lively dissertations.It is clear that many doctoral candidates find research writing complicated and difficult, but the advice they receive often glosses over the complexities of writing and/or locates the problem in the writer. Kamler and Thomson provide a highly effective framework for scholarly work that is located in personal, institutional and cultural contexts.The pedagogical approach developed in the book is based on the notion of writing as a social practice. This approach allows supervisors to think of doctoral writers as novices who need to learn new ways with words as they enter the discursive practices of scholarly communities. This involves learning sophisticated writing practices with specific sets of conventions and textual characteristics. The authors offer supervisors practical advice on helping with commonly encountered writing tasks such as the proposal, the journal abstract, the literature review and constructing the dissertation argument.The first edition of this book has helped many academics and thousands of research students produce better written material. Now fully updated the second edition includes:• Examples from a broader range of academic disciplines• A new chapter on writing from the thesis for peer reviewed journals• More advice on reading and note taking, performance and conferences,• Further information on developing a personal academic writing style, and• Advice on the use of social media (blogs, tweets and wikis) to create trans-disciplinary and trans-national networks and conversations.Their discussion of the complexities of forming a scholarly identity is illustrated throughout by stories and writings of actual doctoral students.In conclusion, they present a persuasive and proven argument that universities must move away from simply auditing supervision to supporting the development of scholarly research communities. Any supervisor keen to help their students develop as academics will find the ideas and practical solutions presented in this book fascinating and insightful reading.},

In this paper we propose a new approach to constructing large high quality unsupervised sets to train DNN models for large vocabulary speech recognition. The core of our technique consists of two steps. We ﬁrst redecode speech logged by our production recognizer with a very accurate (and hence too slow for real-time usage) set of speech models to improve the quality of ground truth transcripts used for training alignments. Using conﬁdence scores, transcript length and transcript ﬂattening heuristics designed to cull salient utterances from three decades of speech per language, we then carefully select training data sets consisting of up to 15K hours of speech to be used to train acoustic models without any reliance on manual transcription. We show that this approach yields models with approximately 18K context dependent states that achieve 10\% relative improvement in large vocabulary dictation and voice-search systems for Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian and Russian languages.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the demand for fossil fuels is quite high. But, the extensive use of fossil fuels is causing the gradual decrease of fossil fuels. Therefore, a way to get rid of widespread of using fossil fuels is by developing a new renewable source that can benefit our environment. Resin is one of the important polymeric in the chemical industry. Resins such as alkyd resins are widely used in coatings and paint industry. There are many researches about producing a resin from renewable sources such as vegetable oils. The naturally used vegetable oils in producing resin are soyabean, rapeseed, coconut, castor or linseed oils. Other than that, there are many potential vegetable oils such as karawila, nahar, rubber or safflower oil. Scientist and engineers are dedicated to find another alternative to replace using fossil fuels as the main components in resin making. This study was inspired to do a research by using palm oil as the main components in making renewable resin or bio resin. In this study, waste cooking oil was used as the main component in making bio resin. The synthesis of resin begins with alcoholysis of waste cooking oil with glycerol followed by esterification process. Then, the monoglyceride was reacted with anhydride to obtain bio resin. The resulting product which is bio resin was characterized for physiochemical properties, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the infrared spectrum using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), melting point using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The result was compared with previous literature about producing resin from renewable material such as karawila seed oil. The expected resin is feasible in replacing synthetic resin. Thus, improvements and more research need to be made as to market the resin.},

abstract = {233 The Brazilian guitar is a countryside musical instrument and presents different characteristics that vary regionally by configuring as a sparse group of string musical instruments. Basically, the instrument diversity comes from different geometries of resonance box, shapes of sound hole, types of wood, different tunings, and number and arrangement of strings. This paper intends to present the numerical and experimental modal analysis of a Brazilian guitar, without strings, in a free boundary condition. The modal analysis technique is applied in the determination of the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes. The main dimensions of an actual Brazilian guitar body are used to build the computational model geometry. The numerical modal analysis uses finite element method (FEM) to determine the dynamic behavior of the vibroacoustic system, which is composed by the structural and acoustic systems coupled. The experimental modal analysis is carried out in an actual Brazilian guitar body, where the structural modal parameters (frequency and mode shape) are extracted and used to update the numerical model. Finally, numerical and experimental results are compared and discussed.},

abstract = {Closed timelike curves are among the most controversial features of modern physics. As legitimate solutions to Einstein's field equations, they allow for time travel, which instinctively seems paradoxical. However, in the quantum regime these paradoxes can be resolved, leaving closed timelike curves consistent with relativity. The study of these systems therefore provides valuable insight into nonlinearities and the emergence of causal structures in quantum mechanics-essential for any formulation of a quantum theory of gravity. Here we experimentally simulate the nonlinear behaviour of a qubit interacting unitarily with an older version of itself, addressing some of the fascinating effects that arise in systems traversing a closed timelike curve. These include perfect discrimination of non-orthogonal states and, most intriguingly, the ability to distinguish nominally equivalent ways of preparing pure quantum states. Finally, we examine the dependence of these effects on the initial qubit state, the form of the unitary interaction and the influence of decoherence. \textcopyright2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Articles from Game Theory Tuesdays have been referenced in The Freakonomics Blog, Yahoo Finance, and CNN.com. Game theory is the study of interactive decision making--that is, in situations where each person's action affects the outcome for the whole group. Game theory is a beautiful subject and this book will teach you how to understand the theory and practically implement solutions through a series of stories and the aid of over 30 illustrations. This book has two primary objectives. (1) To help you recognize strategic games, like the Prisoner's Dilemma, Bertrand Duopoly, Hotelling's Game, the Game of Chicken, and Mutually Assured Destruction. (2) To show you how to make better decisions and change the game, a powerful concept that can transform no-win situations into mutually beneficial outcomes. You'll learn how to negotiate better by making your threats credible, sometimes limiting options or burning bridges, and thinking about new ways to create better outcomes. As these goals indicate, game theory is about more than board games and gambling. It all seems so simple, and yet that definition belies the complexity of game theory. While it may only take seconds to get a sense of game theory, it takes a lifetime to appreciate and master it. This book will get you started.},

Processing big data with large scale neural networks includes two phases: the training phase and the operation phase. Huge computing power is required to support the training phase. And the energy efficiency (power efficiency) is one of the major considerations of the operation phase. We first explore the computing power of GPUs for big data analytics and demonstrate an efficient GPU implementation of the training phase of large scale recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We then introduce a promising ultrahigh energy efficient implementation of neural networks' operation phase by taking advantage of the emerging memristor technique. Experiment results show that the proposed GPU implementation of RNNs is able to achieve 2 $\sim$ 11× speed-up compared with the basic CPU implementation. And the scaled-up recurrent neural network trained with GPUs realizes an accuracy of 47% on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge, the best result achieved by a single RNN on the same dataset. In addition, the proposed memristor-based implementation of neural networks demonstrates power efficiency of > 400 GFLOPS/W and achieves energy savings of 22× on the HMAX model compared with its pure digital implementation counterpart.},

abstract = {Work on this book started more than 15 years ago, when I began a revision of a textbook from 1974 on numerical methods. That book devoted only about 90 pages to matrix computations compared to the more than 700 pages of the present book. This difference reflects not only a change in ambition, but also an increase in size and importance of the subject. A stunning growth in hardware performance has allowed more sophisticated mathematical models to be employed in sciences and engineering. In most of these applications, solution of systems of linear equations and/or eigenvalue problems lies at the core. Increased problem sizes and changes in computer architecture have also made the development of new methods and new implementations of old ones necessary. Although there is a link between matrix computations and linear algebra as taught in departments of mathematics, there are also several important differences. Matrices are used to represent many different objects such as networks and images, besides linear transformations. Concepts such as ill-conditioning, norms, and orthogonality, which do not extend to arbitrary fields, are central to matrix com- putations. This is the reason for not using ‘‘linear algebra'' in the title of the book.},

Theoretically, the wood infl uences the quality of the sound and the vibrations of the membranes. Based upon these facts, an acoustic and vibrational study was carried out in order to establish the relationship between the physical properties of the wood and the resulting sound quality. To do this, digital signal processing techniques were implemented. It was found that volume and sound duration were higher in guitars with German spruce soundboard, whereas guitars with Canadian cedar soundboard presented more homogeneous sounds.},

abstract = {Collisions are an innate part of the function of many musical instruments. Due to the nonlinear nature of contact forces, special care has to be taken in the construction of numerical schemes for simulation and sound synthesis. Finite difference schemes and other time-stepping algorithms used for musical instrument modelling purposes are normally arrived at by discretising a Newtonian description of the system. However because impact forces are non-analytic functions of the phase space variables, algorithm stability can rarely be established this way. This paper presents a systematic approach to deriving energy conserving schemes for frictionless impact modelling. The proposed numerical formulations follow from discretising Hamilton's equations of motion, generally leading to an implicit system of nonlinear equations that can be solved with Newton's method. The approach is first outlined for point mass collisions and then extended to distributed settings, such as vibrating strings and beams colliding with rigid obstacles. Stability and other relevant properties of the proposed approach are discussed and further demonstrated with simulation examples. The methodology is exemplified through a case study on tanpura string vibration, with the results confirming the main findings of previous studies on the role of the bridge in sound generation with this type of string instrument.},

We ﬁrst describe the theory behind double decay and beats, known phenomena caused by the interaction between strings and soundboard. Then we ﬁt the decay of the ﬁrst 30 partials to a standard linear model and two physically-motivated non-linear models that take into account the coupling of strings and soundboard. We show that the use of non-linear models provides a better ﬁt to the data. We use these estimated decay rates to parameterise the characteristic decay response (decay rates along frequencies) of the piano under investigation. The results also show that dynamics have no signiﬁcant effect on the decay rate.},

abstract = {In the early 2000s the context of the pre-salt formations was conceptual geological models of possible oil bearing reservoirs underneath a thick salt layer, many technical challenges, uncertainties and risks. Past only eight years from first discovery (2006), there are nine production systems, FPSOs, in operation, reaching an average oil rate of more than 700 thousand barrels per day and a cumulative production greater than 400 million barrels of oil, through 34 production wells. To optimize recovery, the first desulfated sea water and gas injectors were started. But these impressive numbers cannot be taken from granted: although nature has revealed prolific reservoirs, much experience, talent, planning and perseverance were necessary. The first articles addressing the pre-salt fields had a focus on the technical challenges faced on first years: the heterogeneous nature of the microbial carbonate reservoir, the 2,000 m salt layer and drilling concerns associated, the variable CO2 content and compositional grading in the reservoir fluids, flow assurance issues and special demands concerning subsea engineering, well construction and processing plant. The main drivers and development strategies were also established: staged development, based on extended well tests (EWTs), multi well production pilots and definitive systems prioritizing the standardization of well projects and production systems. Now, challenges and plans are rewarding the efforts, as depicted by the concrete production numbers achieved to date. In this text, a historical perspective of the pre-salt exploration and development is presented, emphasizing the previous unknowns and uncertainties and how they were treated in order to attain the results. As we still have a lot to learn, since we are just on the beginning of the development of this extraordinary petroleum province, a look to the future and the present efforts on optimization are also commented.},

abstract = {Fourier transform methods are used to analyze functions and data sets to provide frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of underlying oscillatory components. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods offer speed advantages over evaluation of explicit integrals (EI) that define Fourier transforms. This paper compares frequency, amplitude, and phase accuracy of the two methods for well resolved peaks over a wide array of data sets including cosine series with and without random noise and a variety of physical data sets, including atmospheric $\mathrmCO_2$ concentrations, tides, temperatures, sound waveforms, and atomic spectra. The FFT uses MIT's FFTW3 library. The EI method uses the rectangle method to compute the areas under the curve via complex math. Results support the hypothesis that EI methods are more accurate than FFT methods. Errors range from 5 to 10 times higher when determining peak frequency by FFT, 1.4 to 60 times higher for peak amplitude, and 6 to 10 times higher for phase under a peak. The ability to compute more accurate Fourier transforms has promise for improved data analysis in many fields, including more sensitive assessment of hypotheses in the environmental sciences related to $\mathrmCO_2$ concentrations and temperature. Other methods are available to address different weaknesses in FFTs; however, the EI method always produces the most accurate output possible for a given data set. On the 2011 Lenovo ThinkPad used in this study, an EI transform on a 10,000 point data set took 31 seconds to complete. Source code (C) and Windows executable for the EI method are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/.},

There is a finite set of users with demand of service and a finite set of potential locations for the facilities that will offer service to users. Two types of decisions must be made: Location decisions determine where to establish the facilities whereas allocation decisions dictate how to satisfy the users demand from the established facilities. Potential applications of various types arise in many different contexts. We provide an overview of the main elements that may intervene in the modeling and the solution process of Fixed-Charge Facility Location Problems, namely, modeling hypotheses and their implications, characteristics of formulations and their relation to other formulations, properties of the domains, and appropriate solution techniques.},

abstract = {The question of "what is thought" has intrigued society for ages, yet it is still a puzzle how the human brain can produce a myriad of thoughts and can store seemingly endless memories. All we know is that sensations received from the outside world imprint some sort of molecular signatures in neurons - or perhaps synapses - for future retrieval. What are these molecular signatures, and how are they made? How are thoughts generated and stored in neurons? The Biology of Thought explores these issues and proposes a new molecular model that sheds light on the basis of human thought. Step-by-step it describes a new hypothesis for how thought is produced at the micro-level in the brain - right at the neuron. Despite its many advances, the neurobiology field lacks a comprehensive explanation of the fundamental aspects of thought generation at the neuron level, and its relation to intelligence and memory. Derived from existing research in the field, this book attempts to lay biological foundations for this phenomenon through a novel mechanism termed the "Molecular-Grid Model" that may explain how biological electrochemical events occurring at the neuron interact to generate thoughts. The proposed molecular model is a testable hypothesis that hopes to change the way we understand critical brain function, and provides a starting point for major advances in this field that will be of interest to neuroscientists the world over.},

abstract = {Umberto Eco's wise and witty guide to researching and writing a thesis, published in English for the first time. By the time Umberto Eco published his best-selling novel The Name of the Rose, he was one of Italy's most celebrated intellectuals, a distinguished academic and the author of influential works on semiotics. Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, How to Write a Thesis, in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis―from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, How to Write a Thesis has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English. Eco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. How to Write a Thesis is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid "thesis neurosis" and he answers the important question "Must You Read Books?" He reminds students "You are not Proust" and "Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft." Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data.How to Write a Thesis belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere. Already a classic, it would fit nicely between two other classics: Strunk and White and The Name of the Rose.ContentsThe Definition and Purpose of a Thesis • Choosing the Topic • Conducting Research • The Work Plan and the Index Cards • Writing the Thesis • The Final Draft},

To investigate the key challenges, we used a mixed-method research approach which includes both a large-scale survey of 5389 responses and an in-depth multiple-case study. The initial findings reveal that thriving in technology uncertainty and acquiring the first paying customer are among the top challenges, perceived and experienced by early-stage software startups.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a physical modelling sound synthesis environment for the production of valved brass instrument sounds. The governing equations of the system are solved using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods and the environment is implemented in the C programming language. Users of the environment can create their own custom instruments and are able to control player parameters such as lip frequency, mouth pressure and valve openings through the use of instrument and score files. The algorithm for sound synthesis is presented in detail along with a discussion of optimisation methods used to reduce run time. Binaries for the environment are available for download online for multiple platforms.},

abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},

abstract = {Despite numerous studies on skill development, we know little about the effects of extracurricular music activities on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. This study examines how music training during childhood and youth affects the development of cognitive skills, school grades, personality, time use and ambition using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our findings suggest that adolescents with music training have better school grades, are more conscientious, open and ambitious. These effects are stronger among adolescents from lower socio-economic status. In order to address the non-random selection into playing music, we take into account detailed information on the child and its parents, which may determine both the decision to pursue music lessons and educational outcomes. While lacking truly exogenous variations in music activities, our results are robust to a large range of sensitivity tests. We thereby approach causality better than previous observational studies.},

Do you have a great idea for an app, but don't know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you're just frustrated that to learn Android, you must know java. If so, Android Programming for Beginners is for you. You don't need any programming experience to follow along with this book, just a computer and a sense of adventure. What You Will Learn Master the fundamentals of coding Java for Android Install and set up your Android development environment Build functional user interfaces with the Android Studio visual designer Add user interaction, data captures, sound, and animation to your apps Manage your apps' data using the built-in Android SQLite database Find out about the design patterns used by professionals to make top-grade applications Build, deploy, and publish real Android applications to the Google Play marketplaceIn DetailAndroid is the most popular OS in the world. There are millions of devices accessing tens of thousands of applications. It is many people's entry point into the world of technology; it is an operating system for everyone. Despite this, the entry-fee to actually make Android applications is usually a computer science degree, or five years' worth of Java experience. Android Programming for Beginners will be your companion to create Android applications from scratchwhether you're looking to start your programming career, make an application for work, be reintroduced to mobile development, or are just looking to program for fun. We will introduce you to all the fundamental concepts of programming in an Android context, from the Java basics to working with the Android API. All examples are created from within Android Studio, the official Android development environment that helps supercharge your application development process. After this crash-course, we'll dive deeper into Android programming and you'll learn how to create applications with a professional-standard UI through fragments, make location-aware apps with Google Maps integration, and store your user's data with SQLite. In addition, you'll see how to make your apps multilingual, capture images from a device's camera, and work with graphics, sound, and animations too. By the end of this book, you'll be ready to start building your own custom applications in Android and Java. Style and approachWith more than 40 mini apps to code and run, Android Programming for Beginners is a hands-on guide to learning Android and Java. Each example application demonstrates a different aspect of Android programming. Alongside these mini apps, we push your abilities by building three larger applications to demonstrate Android application development in context.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, due to the increased environmental awareness, numerous studies for production of biocomposites based on natural fibers have been published and many comprehensive reviews have been published. Compared with conventional reinforcements, such as glass and carbon fibers, natural fibers which are renewable resources, offer several other advantages including a wide availability (based on different vegetable species), recyclability, low density and low costs, low abrasion and preserving mechanical properties. Application of cellulose fibers in composites is not only beneficial from an ecological point of view, lowering the environmental impact of the final product within the production, usage and disposal period, but it offers further technical and economical benefits. Especially, natural fiber-reinforced biocomposites have the potential to replace current materials used for automotive industrial applications. In order to obtain composites with the best mechanical properties, most of the research activities in the last decades have been concentrated on the surface physical and chemical modifications of the fibers mainly to optimize their interfacial behavior. In the first part of this work, besides the overview of the state-of-the-art description regarding biocomposites, we will also present characterization results of the lab-scaled flax fiber reinforced biopolymer matrices (PLA) as well as compared with the same-industrially produced composites. In the second part of the paper, biocomposites based on "self-reinforced cellulose" or "all-cellulose" composites prepared from cotton textile fabrics by partial fiber surface dissolution in lithium chloride dissolved in N, N-dimethylacetamide will be presented. Two different parameters have been studied: (i) surface treatment medium (alkaline/enzyme/bleaching) and (ii) cotton textile preforms (knits, woven).},

abstract = {How does a patent strategy affect a tech startup company's growth? This is a fundamental question for technology entrepreneurs, investors, lawyers and the innovation system as a whole. In this study, I shed light on this issue by conducting an empirical analysis of the patenting strategies of technology startups, examining the relationship between a company's patent applications and different events over the company's life: rounds of investment received, company acquisition and closure. I provide the first comprehensive cross-industry analysis of this question, by analyzing the patent portfolios of United States startups listed in CrunchBase, a crowd-sourced registry of tech companies used by the startup industry. By looking into these companies' public patent applications from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database between 2008 and 2012, I examine the patenting patterns of startups as they progress through funding rounds. Through a quantitative analysis, I find that companies based in California tend to patent more than in other states, and that companies that are venture-backed patent more than those who are not. I also unveil that most start-ups that patent file their first application before even receiving any reported funding. Moreover, I find that there is a significant positive relationship between patent protection, and receiving investment and being acquired. I further find that the number of patents (and not merely the fact that a company has patents or not) contributes to higher total funding. I finally observe that patenting early is also associated to higher funding, and that early may be more important for start-ups than what some views in venture capital may predict. I also conclude that while more patents are associated with higher funding, patents account for a relevant but small portion of a company's success. The study provides novel insights on startup patenting strategies. It lays empirical groundwork on key circumstances under which patents can contribute to a startup's growth, to provide important guidance to the legal and entrepreneurial communities.},

Multiple types of microplastics, including fibers, fragments and pellets, occurred in the tissue of all bivalves. The number of total microplastics varied from 2.1 to 10.5 items/g and from 4.3 to 57.2 items/individual for bivalves. Scapharca subcrenata contained on average 10.5 items/g and exhibited the highest levels of microplastics by weight. Fibers were the most common microplastics and consisted of more than half of the total microplastics in each of the 8 species. In Alectryonella plicatula, pellets accounted for 60% of the total microplastics. The most common size class was less than 250 $\mu$m and accounted for 33-84% of the total microplastics calculated by species. Our results suggest that microplastic pollution was widespread and exhibited a relatively high level in commercial bivalves from China. More intensive investigations on microplastics should be conducted in seafood.},

abstract = {Frequency estimation from discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefﬁcients of a rectangular windowed signal under the inﬂuence of additive white noise is a well studied problem in signal processing. In its simplest form, the process involves ﬁnding the spectral peaks. When higher frequency resolution is required, a frequency offset can be found from the interpolation of DFT coefﬁcients. However, most of the past researches focus on monotonic cisoid signals. In practical situations where multiple harmonics are present, the sidelobes from other harmonics interfere with the estimation of the harmonic being considered. In this case, windows with smaller sidelobes such as Hanning window are preferred over rectangular window. Given the increased mathematical complexity of Hanning window, analytical solution has not yet been available for DFT interpolation. In this paper, we derive an exact analytical solution of the estimated frequency from DFT interpolation of Hanning windowed signal. In experiments, we show that the new analytical solution is accurate for monotonic cisoid signal and can considerably reduce the effect of interharmonic interference as compared to previous rectangular windowed methods.},

Weight loss for bioplastic pots was evaluated. Results showed that bioplastic pots tested below ground had a higher percentage of weight loss than those planted above ground. For percentage of weight loss of bioplastic pots, most bioplastic pots that were tested in both ground levels only showed a significant difference at p ⩽ 0.05 after 30 days. Bioplastic pots B75%:N25% that were tested below ground have the highest percentage of weight loss with 77.93%.

abstract = {The assumption of game theory is that the players in game must be rational. In the game of incomplete information, participants are not completely clear about the game. Therefore, usually there is a probability distribution of strategy selection in game. It is very complicated to know the real game information of the social and economic problems. In fact, the actual situation for many problems is that game players are irrational, or the probability distribution of game players' strategies cannot be gotten, even the strategy sets are not complete (infinite strategy sets).There are many limitations in application of the traditional game theory. In this paper, the concept of complex information game and its Nash equilibrium are presented. It is proved that the complex information game problem can be solved by artificial neural network. An example on how to solve the complex information game problem with artificial neural network is given as well. Researchers hope that more and more scholars can use artificial intelligence theory to analyze the game theory problem. Therefore, the complex information game problems can be dealt more efficiently.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against baselines using bag-ofwords and bag-of-bigrams for state representations. Our algorithm outperforms the baselines on both worlds demonstrating the importance of learning expressive representations.1.},

abstract = {The use of starch based films as a potential alternative choice to petroleum derived plastics is imperative for environmental waste management. This study presents a new biopolymer (sugar palm starch) for the preparation of biodegradable packaging films using a solution casting technique. The effect of different plasticizer types (glycerol (G), sorbitol (S) and glycerol-sorbitol (GS) combination) with varying concentrations (0, 15, 30 and 45, w/w%) on the tensile, thermal and barrier properties of sugar palm starch (SPS) films was evaluated. Regardless of plasticizer types, the tensile strength of plasticized SPS films decreased, whereas their elongation at break (E%) increased as the plasticizer concentrations were raised. However, the E% for G and GS-plasticized films significantly decreased at a higher plasticizer concentration (45% w/w) due to the anti-plasticization effect of plasticizers. Change in plasticizer concentration showed an insignificant effect on the thermal properties of S-plasticized films. The glass transition temperature of SPS films slightly decreased as the plasticizer concentration increased from 15% to 45%.

abstract = {The production of sound by acoustic musical instruments is caused by the vibration of a resonant structure that can be described by signal corresponding to the temporal evolution of the vibration associated with the sound pressure. The fact that the sound can be characterized by a set of signals, suggests that a device can generate sound and therefore imitate sounds of acoustic instruments. Such device is called a synthesizer, its main component in sound production is an oscillator. This work presents the synthesis of a classic theme of West Coast Jazz that has as peculiarity an odd metric. All the notes were identified in the score and synthesized on computer.},

abstract = {Neuroscience research has exploded, with more than fifty thousand neuroscientists applying increasingly advanced methods. A mountain of new facts and mechanisms has emerged. And yet a principled framework to organize this knowledge has been missing. In this book, Peter Sterling and Simon Laughlin, two leading neuroscientists, strive to fill this gap, outlining a set of organizing principles to explain the whys of neural design that allow the brain to compute so efficiently. Setting out to –reverse engineer— the brain -- disassembling it to understand it -- Sterling and Laughlin first consider why an animal should need a brain, tracing computational abilities from bacterium to protozoan to worm. They examine bigger brains and the advantages of –anticipatory regulation— identify constraints on neural design and the need to –nanofy— and demonstrate the routes to efficiency in an integrated molecular system, phototransduction. They show that the principles of neural design at finer scales and lower levels apply at larger scales and higher levels; describe neural wiring efficiency; and discuss learning as a principle of biological design that includes –save only what is needed.—Sterling and Laughlin avoid speculation about how the brain might work and endeavor to make sense of what is already known. Their distinctive contribution is to gather a coherent set of basic rules and exemplify them across spatial and functional scales. .},

Unlike other popularizations that shy away from quantum mechanics' weirdness, Quantum Mechanics embraces the utter strangeness of quantum logic. The authors offer crystal-clear explanations of the principles of quantum states, uncertainty and time dependence, entanglement, and particle and wave states, among other topics, and each chapter includes exercises to ensure mastery of each area.

As a consequence, clustering can suffer from the presence of noisy data points and outliers,which can obscure the structure of the clusters in the data and thus may drive clustering algorithms to yield suboptimal or even misleading results. Fuzzy clustering is no exception in this respect, although it features an aspect of robustness, due to which outliers and generally data points that are atypical for the clusters in the data have a lesser influence on the cluster parameters. Starting from this aspect, we provide in this paper an overview of different approaches with which fuzzy clustering can be made less sensitive to noise and outliers and categorize them according to the component of standard fuzzy clustering they modify.},

abstract = {Background and objective: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have recently been applied in situations where an analysis based on the logistic regression (LR) is a standard statistical approach; direct comparisons of the results, however, are seldom attempted. In this study, we compared both logistic regression models and feed-forward neural networks on the academic failure data set. Methods: The data for this study included 18 questions about study situation of 275 undergraduate students selected randomly from among nursing and midwifery and paramedic schools of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences in 2013. Logistic regression with forward method and feed forward Artificial Neural Network with 15 neurons in hidden layer were fitted to the dataset. The accuracy of the models in predicting academic failure was compared by using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and classification accuracy. Results: Among nine ANNs, the ANN with 15 neurons in hidden layer was a better ANN compared with LR. The Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of the LR model and ANN with 15 neurons in hidden layers, were estimated as 0.55 and 0.89, respectively and ANN was significantly greater than the LR. The LR and ANN models respectively classified 77.5% and 84.3% of the students correctly. Conclusion: Based on this dataset, it seems the classification of the students in two groups with and without academic failure by using ANN with 15 neurons in the hidden layer is better than the LR model.},

The research is built upon daily CDS spreads of 40 international banks for the period from June 2007 to March 2010, i.e. at the heart of the global financial crisis. For this time period, 20 of the financial institutions received federal bailouts and are labeled as defaults while the remaining institutions are categorized as non-defaults. The employed multivariate pattern recognition approach represents a modification of the CORA3 algorithm. The approach is found to be robust regardless of reasonable changes of its inputs. Despite the fact that distinct alarm indices for banks do not clearly demonstrate predictive capabilities of the LPPL, the synchronized alarm indices confirm the multivariate discriminative power of LPPL patterns in CDS spread developments acknowledged by bootstrap intervals with 70% confidence level.},

abstract = {This book presents a greatly enlarged statistical framework compared to generalized linear models (GLMs) with which to approach regression modelling. Comprising of about half-a-dozen major classes of statistical models, and fortified with necessary infrastructure to make the models more fully operable, the framework allows analyses based on many semi-traditional applied statistics models to be performed as a coherent whole. Since their advent in 1972, GLMs have unified important distributions under a single umbrella with enormous implications. However, GLMs are not flexible enough to cope with the demands of practical data analysis. And data-driven GLMs, in the form of generalized additive models (GAMs), are also largely confined to the exponential family. The methodology here and accompanying software (the extensive VGAM R package) are directed at these limitations and are described comprehensively for the first time in one volume. This book treats distributions and classical models as generalized regression models, and the result is a much broader application base for GLMs and GAMs. The book can be used in senior undergraduate or first-year postgraduate courses on GLMs or categorical data analysis and as a methodology resource for VGAM users. In the second part of the book, the R package VGAM allows readers to grasp immediately applications of the methodology. R code is integrated in the text, and datasets are used throughout. Potential applications include ecology, finance, biostatistics, and social sciences. The methodological contribution of this book stands alone and does not require use of the VGAM package.},

It introduces the basics of LISP required to use a Fuzzy LISP programming toolbox, which was specifically implemented by the author to "teach" the theory behind fuzzy logic and at the same time equip readers to use their newly-acquired knowledge to build fuzzy models of increasing complexity. The book fills an important gap in the literature, providing readers with a practice-oriented reference guide to fuzzy logic that offers more complexity than popular books yet is more accessible than other mathematical treatises on the topic. As such, students in first-year university courses with a basic tertiary mathematical background and no previous experience with programming should be able to easily follow the content. The book is intended for students and professionals in the fields of computer science and engineering, as well as disciplines including astronomy, biology, medicine and earth sciences. Software developers may also benefit from this book, which is intended as both an introductory textbook and self-study reference guide to fuzzy logic and its applications.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

While research has gained important insight into the technical challenges, few studies to date explore the behavioral aspects for product developers as they move to employ bioplastics in their development efforts. This manuscript reports the findings of a grounded inductive study based on interview data with 32 product developers in the consumer goods industry. The Theory of Planned Behavior is employed to guide the research and provide a theoretical background to derive implications. The study finds that behavioral challenges impede the increased use of bioplastics. Product developers experience a lack of perceived behavioral control and struggle with doubts about the environmental benefits and incurring trade-offs of bioplastics with respect to the Triple Bottom Line. While product developers are intrinsically motivated to make more use of bioplastics, they often refrain from bringing products to the mass market due to uncertainties of customer receptiveness and fears of greenwashing allegations. Implications for industry and research are detailed.},

abstract = {Introduction This book addresses core questions about the role of materials in general and of wood in particular in the construction of string instruments used in the modern symphony orchestra - violins, violas, cellos and basses. Further attention is given to materials for classical guitars, harps, harpsichords and pianos. While some of the approaches discussed are traditional, most of them depend upon new scientific approaches to the study of the structure of materials, such as for example wood cell structure, which is visible only using modern high resolution microscopic techniques. Many examples of modern and classical instruments are examined, together with the relevance of classical techniques for the treatment of wood. Composite materials, especially designed for soundboards could be a good substitute for some traditional wood species. The body and soundboard of the instrument are of major importance for their acoustical properties, but the study also examines traditional and new wood species used for items such as bows, the instrument neck, string pegs, etc. Wood species' properties for musical instruments and growth origins of woods used by great makers such as Antonio Stradivari are examined and compared with more recently grown woods available to current makers. The role of varnish in the appearance and acoustics of the final instrument is also discussed, since it has often been proposed as a ‘secret ingredient' used by great makers. Aspects related to strings are commented. As well as discussing these subjects, with many illustrations from classical and contemporary instruments, the book gives attention to conservation and restoration of old instruments and the physical results of these techniques. There is also discussion of the current value of old instruments both for modern performances and as works of art having great monetary value. The book will be of interest and value to researchers, advanced students, music historians, and contemporary string instrument makers. Musicians in general, particularly those playing string instruments, will also find its revelations fascinating. It will also attract the attention of those using wood for a variety of other purposes, for its use in musical instruments uncovers many of its fundamental features.},

abstract = {Forecasting of production in unconventional prospects has gained a lot of attention in the recent years. The key challenges in unconventional reservoirs have been the requirement to put online a) a large number of wells in a short period of time, b) well productivity significantly driven by completion characteristics and that c) the physics of fluid flow in these prospects still remain uncertain. In this paper, machine learning algorithms are used to forecast production for existing and new wells in unconventional assets using inputs like geological maps, production history, pressure data and operational constraints. One of the most popular Machine Learning methods - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed for this purpose. ANN can learn from large volume of data points without assuming a predetermined model and can adapt to newer data as and when it becomes available. The workflow involves using these data sets to train and optimize the ANN model which, subsequently, is used to predict the well production performance of both existing wells using their own history and new wells by using the history of nearby wells which were drilled in analogous geological locations. The proposed technique requires users to do less data conditioning and model building and focus more on analyzing what-if scenarios and determining the well performance.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are increasingly used in many areas of computer vision. They are particularly attractive because of their ability to "absorb" great quantities of labeled data through millions of parameters. However, as model sizes increase, so do the storage and memory requirements of the classifiers, hindering many applications such as image and speech recognition on mobile phones and other devices. In this paper, we present a novel network architecture, Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets (FreshNets), which exploits inherent redundancy in both convolutional layers and fully-connected layers of a deep learning model, leading to dramatic savings in memory and storage consumption. Based on the key observation that the weights of learned convolutional filters are typically smooth and low-frequency, we first convert filter weights to the frequency domain with a discrete cosine transform (DCT) and use a low-cost hash function to randomly group frequency parameters into hash buckets. All parameters assigned the same hash bucket share a single value learned with standard backpropagation. To further reduce model size, we allocate fewer hash buckets to high-frequency components, which are generally less important. We evaluate FreshNets on eight data sets, and show that it leads to better compressed performance than several relevant baselines.},

abstract = {There has been a considerable increase on research of the ecological consequences of microplastics released into the environment, but only a handful of works have focused on the nano-sized particles of polymer-based materials. Though their presence has been difficult to adequately ascertain, due to the inherent technical difficulties for isolating and quantifying them, there is an overall consensus that these are not only present in the environment - either directly released or as the result of weathering of larger fragments - but that they also pose a significant threat to the environment and human health, as well. The reduced size of these particulates (<1 $\mu$m) makes them susceptible of ingestion by organisms that are at the base of the food-chain. Moreover, the characteristic high surface area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles may add to their potential hazardous effects, as other contaminants, such as persistent organic pollutants, could be adsorbed and undergo bioaccumulation and bioamplification phenomena. In this review, we describe the most relevant sources of nanoplastics and offer some insights into their fate once released into the environment. Furthermore, we overviewthemost prominent effects of these small particulates, while identifying the key challenges scientists currently face in the research of nanoplastics in the environment. Lastly, we give a brief summary of the economic impacts of the pollution caused by plastic litter - a potential key source of nanoplastics - in the oceans, the most common destination of these contaminants.},

author = {Cost and Moheb I},
abstract = {The real story of how our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes―with or without "brain training."Fifty years ago, neuroscientists thought that a mature brain was fixed like a fly in amber, unable to change. Today, we know that our brains and nervous systems change throughout our lifetimes. This concept of neuroplasticity has captured the imagination of a public eager for self-improvement―and has inspired countless Internet entrepreneurs who peddle dubious "brain training" games and apps. In this book, Moheb Costandi offers a concise and engaging overview of neuroplasticity for the general reader, describing how our brains change continuously in response to our actions and experiences.Costandi discusses key experimental findings, and describes how our thinking about the brain has evolved over time. He explains how the brain changes during development, and the "synaptic pruning" that takes place before brain maturity. He shows that adult brains can grow new cells (citing, among many other studies, research showing that sexually mature male canaries learn a new song every year). He describes the kind of brain training that can bring about improvement in brain function. It's not gadgets and games that promise to "rewire your brain" but such sustained cognitive tasks as learning a musical instrument or a new language. (Costandi also notes that London cabbies increase their gray matter after rigorous training in their city's complicated streets.) He tells how brains compensate after stroke or injury; describes addiction and pain as maladaptive forms of neuroplasticity; and considers brain changes that accompany childhood, adolescence, parenthood, and aging. Each of our brains is custom-built. Neuroplasticity is at the heart of what makes us human.},

abstract = {In order to build prospective scenarios for biodiesel industry in Brazil, with a sustainable perspective, it was necessary to develop a cross-disciplinary work to include Sachs' dimensions of sustainability into the scenarios method. This meant linking concepts from different disciplines, without transforming it in a new discipline. In order to support the proposition for the new method, a study case is presented, the framework for the biodiesel scenarios in Brazil, by 2030. An in-depth interview was used to test the proposition of having the sustainability dimensions as driving forces. The result was the identification of a critical uncertainty composed of various aspects related the response to climate change and environmental conservation. The scenario storylines that were developed based on the critical uncertainties showed that sustainable options for the future are possible if the mental maps are enlarged to see beyond the business as usual. The results show that the scenarios storylines go through social, environmental and economic aspects, supported by other aspects like the territorial and political. Also it showed that sustainable options are possible if the mental maps are enlarged to see beyond the business as usual.},

We empirically explored five early stage software startups to understand how MVP are used in early stages. Data was collected from interviews, observation and documents. We looked at the MVP usage from two angles, software prototyping and boundary spanning theory. We found that roles of MVPs in startups were not fully aware by entrepreneurs. Besides supporting validated learning, MVPs are used to facilitate product design, to bridge communication gaps and to facilitate cost-effective product development activities. Entrepreneurs should consider a systematic approach to fully explore the value of MVP, as a multiple facet product (MFP). The work also implies several research directions about prototyping practices and patterns in software startups.},

Our approach fits a full perspective camera and a parametric 3D head model to the portrait, and then builds a 2D warp in the image plane to approximate the effect of a desired change in 3D. We show that this model is capable of correcting objectionable artifacts such as the large noses sometimes seen in "selfies," or to deliberately bring a distant camera closer to the subject. This framework can also be used to re-pose the subject, as well as to create stereo pairs from an input portrait. We show convincing results on both an existing dataset as well as a new dataset we captured to validate our method.},

In this paper, we show that these fundamental properties are satisfied by the architecture of deep neural networks. We formally prove that these networks with random Gaussian weights perform a distance-preserving embedding of the data, with a special treatment for in-class and out-of-class data. Similar points at the input of the network are likely to have a similar output. The theoretical analysis of deep networks here presented exploits tools used in the compressed sensing and dictionary learning literature, thereby making a formal connection between these important topics. The derived results allow drawing conclusions on the metric learning properties of the network and their relation to its structure, as well as providing bounds on the required size of the training set such that the training examples would represent faithfully the unseen data. The results are validated with state-of-the-art trained networks.},

abstract = {"Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

This suggests that all three databases provide sufﬁcient stability of coverage to be used for more detailed cross-disciplinary comparisons.

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently state-of-the-art for various classification tasks, but are computationally expensive. Propagating through the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer must sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward propagation which equates to $\mathcalO(N^2n^2)$ per kernel per layer where the inputs are $N \times N$ arrays and the kernels are $n \times n$ arrays. Convolution can be efficiently performed as a Hadamard product in the frequency domain. The bottleneck is the transformation which has a cost of $\mathcalO(N^2\log_2 N)$ using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, the increase in efficiency is less significant when $N\gg n$ as is the case in CNNs. We mitigate this by using the "overlap-and-add" technique reducing the computational complexity to $\mathcalO(N^2\log_2 n)$ per kernel. This method increases the algorithm's efficiency in both the forward and backward propagation, reducing the training and testing time for CNNs. Our empirical results show our method reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16.3 times the traditional convolution implementation for a 8 $\times$ 8 kernel and a 224 $\times$ 224 image.},

abstract = {When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the effects of latency (0-20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms ± 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

We refer to theories in which one or more groups of agents ("coalitions") deliberately get together to jointly determine within-group actions, while interacting noncooperatively across groups. The chapter describes a variety of solution concepts, using an umbrella model that adopts an explicit real-time approach. Players band together, perhaps disband later and re-form in shifting alliances, all the while receiving payoffs at each date according to the coalition structure prevailing at the time. We use this model to nest two broad approaches to coalition formation, one based on cooperative game theory, the other based on noncooperative bargaining. Three themes that receive explicit emphasis are agent farsightedness, the description of equilibrium coalition structures, and the efficiency implications of the various theories.},

However, when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations) are not easily understood and require time to assimilate. These concepts are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, so students' understanding of them is vital to mastering the subject. This text makes these concepts more accessible by introducing them early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, developing them gradually, and returning to them throughout the text so that when they are discussed in the abstract, students are readily able to understand.},

Design of bracings and their placements on the soundboard increase its structural stiffness as well as redistributing its deflection to nonbraced regions and affecting its loudness as well as its response at low and high frequencies.This paper attempts to present a review of the current state of the art in guitar research and to propose viable alternatives that will ultimately result in a louder and better sounding instrument. Current research is an attempt to increase the sound level with bracing designs and their placements, control of natural frequencies using scalloped braces, aswell as improve the acoustic radiation of this instrument at higher frequencies by deliberately inducing asymmetricmodes in the soundboard using the concept of "splitting board." Variousmathematicalmethods are available for analysing the soundboard based on the theory of thin plates. Discrete models of the instrument up to 4 degrees of freedom are also presented. Results from finite element analysis can be utilized for the evaluation of acoustic radiation.},

However, both methods require making small perturbations to numerous entries of the input vector, which is inappropriate for sparse high-dimensional inputs such as one-hot word representations. We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to the text domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrent neural network rather than to the original input itself. The proposed method achieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised and purely supervised tasks. We provide visualizations and analysis showing that the learned word embeddings have improved in quality and that while training, the model is less prone to overfitting.},

abstract = {Bibliometric methods are used in multiple ﬁelds for a variety of purposes, namely for research evaluation. Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus. The objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some ﬁeld, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. To do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in WoS (13,605 journals) and Scopus (20,346 journals) with Ulrich's extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. These results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, WoS and Scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different ﬁelds, institutions, countries or languages. The bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientiﬁc output that are not covered in WoS or Scopus, such as ﬁeld-speciﬁc and national citation indexes.},

abstract = {This paper presents the successful history of Lula NE Pilot Project, a challenging megaproject with an aggressive time-driven schedule, faster than industry average, that demanded new technology development in a scenario of uncertainty. The area is part of the supergiant Lula field, located in the pre-salt region of Santos Basin, Southeast Brazil, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, in 2000 m water depth. It is a joint venture with Petrobras as the Operator, and BG E&P Brasil and Petrogal Brasil as partners. The project was designed as a Pilot aiming to test some new concepts for the production development in the pre-salt area. In terms of subsea gathering system, an innovative concept was deployed, combining flexible flowlines lying on sea floor, with rigid steel catenary risers (SCR) supported by a buoy positioned 250 m below sea level. The drainage plan considered eight oil producers, some of them with intelligent completion, one gas/CO2 injection well and five water alternating gas (WAG) injectors (two subsea WAG manifolds were also installed). A balanced approach between data acquisition and facilities flexibility made possible to face the many reservoir and production uncertainties. Details of the development concept will be discussed, as well as the main results obtained so far, highlighting the strategies adopted in order to mitigate risks and the influence of the acquired information to the following projects in the area.

abstract = {A vocoder-based speech synthesis system, named WORLD, was developed in an effort to improve the sound quality of realtime applications using speech. Speech analysis, manipulation, and synthesis on the basis of vocoders are used in various kinds of speech research. Although several high-quality speech synthesis systems have been developed, real-time processing has been difficult with them because of their high computational costs. This new speech synthesis system has not only sound quality but also quick processing. It consists of three analysis algorithms and one synthesis algorithm proposed in our previous research. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated by comparing its output with against natural speech including consonants. Its processing speed was also compared with those of conventional systems. The results showed that WORLD was superior to the other systems in terms of both sound quality and processing speed. In particular, it was over ten times faster than the conventional systems, and the real time factor (RTF) indicated that it was fast enough for real-time processing.},

They have been developed as biomaterials with unique properties for the past many years being considered as a potential substitute for conventional non-degradable plastics. Due to the increasing concern towards global climate change, depleting petroleum resource and problems with an utilization of a growing number of synthetic plastics, PHAs have gained much more attention from industry and research. These environmentally friendly microbial polymers have great potential in biomedical, agricultural, and industrial applications. However, their production on a large scale is still limited. This paper describes the backgrounds of PHAs and discussed the current state of knowledge on the polyhydroxyalkanoates. Ability of bacteria to convert different carbon sources to PHAs, the opportunities and challenges of their introduction to global market as valuable renewable products have been also discussed.},

abstract = {The present paper describes a singing voice synthesis based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Singing voice synthesis systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently being proposed and are improving the naturalness of synthesized singing voices. In these systems, the relationship between musical score feature sequences and acoustic feature sequences extracted from singing voices is modeled by DNNs. Then, an acoustic feature sequence of an arbitrary musical score is output in units of frames by the trained DNNs, and a natural trajectory of a singing voice is obtained by using a parameter generation algorithm. As singing voices contain rich expression, a powerful technique to model them accurately is required. In the proposed technique, long-term dependencies of singing voices are modeled by CNNs. An acoustic feature sequence is generated in units of segments that consist of long-term frames, and a natural trajectory is obtained without the parameter generation algorithm. Experimental results in a subjective listening test show that the proposed architecture can synthesize natural sounding singing voices.},

abstract = {Natural fiber reinforced polymer composites have emerged as a potential environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternative to synthetic fiber reinforced composites. Therefore, in the past decade, a number of major industries, such as the automotive, construction and packaging industries, have shown a considerable interest in the progress of new natural fiber reinforced composite materials. The availability of natural fibers and the ease of manufacturing have tempted researchers to study their feasibility of their application as reinforcement and the extent to which they satisfy the required specifications in tribological applications. However, less information concerning the tribological performance of natural fiber reinforced composite material is available in the literature. Hence, the aim of this bibliographic review is to demonstrate the tribological behavior of natural fiber reinforced composites and find a knowledge about their usability for various applications that tribology plays a dominant role. This review presents the reported work on natural fiber reinforced composites with special reference to the type of fibers, matrix polymers, treatment of fibers and test parameters. The results show that composites reinforced with natural fibers have an improvement in tribological properties and their properties are comparable with conventional fibers. In addition, fiber treatment and fiber orientation are two important factors can affect tribological properties where treated fibers and normal oriented fibers exhibit better friction and wear behavior. This review is trying to evaluate the effect of test parameter including normal load and sliding speed on tribological properties, and the results vary based on type of reinforcement. Generally, due to their positive economic and environmental aspects, as well as their good tribological properties, natural composites are showing a good potential for employing in several applications.},

The model can be conditioned on any vector, including descriptive labels or tags, or latent embeddings created by other networks. When conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database, the model is able to generate diverse, realistic scenes representing distinct animals, objects, landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face, it generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial expressions, poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional PixelCNN can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder. Additionally, the gated convolutional layers in the proposed model improve the log-likelihood of PixelCNN to match the state-of-the-art performance of PixelRNN on ImageNet, with greatly reduced computational cost.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of learning a Nash equilibrium in $\gamma$-discounted multiplayer general-sum Markov Games (MGs) in a batch setting. As the number of players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase their final rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to find a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov Games. In this paper, we introduce a new definition of ϵ-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy's quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellman-like residuals implies to learn such an ϵ-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the Lp norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium in generic multiplayer general-sum turn-based MGs.},

We focus on the importance of choosing the correct input features, along with their preprocessing, for the specific learning algorithm one wants to use. Eventually, we consider the S&P500 historical time series, predicting trend on the basis of data from the past days, and proposing a novel approach based on combination of wavelets and CNN, which outperforms the basic neural networks ones. We show, that neural networks are able to predict financial time series movements even trained only on plain time series data and propose more ways to improve results.},

abstract = {For learning in big datasets, the classification performance of ELM might be low due to input samples are not extracted features properly. To address this problem, the hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) framework was proposed based on the hierarchical learning architecture of multilayer perceptron. H-ELM composes of two parts; the first is the unsupervised multilayer encoding part and the second part is the supervised feature classification part. H-ELM can give higher accuracy rate than of the traditional ELM. However, it still has to enhance its classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method namely as the extending hierarchical extreme learning machine (EH-ELM). For the extended supervisor part of EH-ELM, we have got an idea from the two-layers extreme learning machine. To evaluate the performance of EH-ELM, three different image datasets; Semeion, MNIST, and NORB, were studied. The experimental results show that EH-ELM achieves better performance than of H-ELM and the other multi-layer framework.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This study explores people's perceptions (i.e., positive and negative associations, mixed feelings) regarding the concept of 'bio-based' in general and specific bio-based products. This exploratory study is one of the first consumer studies in the field of bio-based research. Three focus group discussions were organized in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands (with 89 participants in total) in which projective techniques were applied. Results of these group discussions indicate that participants are unfamiliar with 'bio-based' as a concept. 'Bio-based' is most often associated with positive environmental issues as "naturalness" and "environmental friendly" but also with negative environmental associations and to a lesser extent with technological and health issues. Associations with 'bio-based' as a general concept and with particular bio-based products can be simultaneously positive and negative, which caused uncertainty and mixed feelings by the respondents. This idea highlights both the complexity of and a lack of familiarity with the concept of 'bio-based'. Consumers have a holistic perception of bio-based products, i.e., they combine their perception of different aspects of the product in an evaluation of the whole product concept (e.g., their perception of the original product, usability, production method, proportion of bio-based materials used, price, packaging material, and appearance). Discussions on 'bio-based' as a concept are more general and abstract, while discussions and associations related to bio-based products are more specific. This study's qualitative approach illustrates in detail the great variety in consumers' perceptions, which can be both cognitive and affective (including positive, negative and mixed feelings towards 'bio-based' as a concept as well as bio-based products).},

You will also need a course ID from your instructor to access MyOMLab. Operations management is important, exciting, challenging \ldotsand everywhere you look! Important, because it enables organizations to provide services and products that we all need Exciting, because it is central to constant changes in customer preference, networks of supply and demand, and developments in technology Challenging, because solutions must be must be financially sound, resource-efficient, as well as environmentally and socially responsible And everywhere, because in our daily lives, whether at work or at home, we all experience and manage processes and operations. New features: There are now more than 110 of the popular ‘Operations in Practice' examples throughout the book, over 40 /\\% of which are new. The importance of sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been emphasized further, and included throughout the book. We have even further strengthened the emphasis on the idea that ‘operations management' is relevant to every type of business and all functional areas of the organization. Many new ideas in operations management have been incorporated, including the ‘three level' approach to performance, the relationship between innovation, creativity and design, crowdsourcing, ideas management, business ecosystems, triadic relationships, office layout, telecommuting and organisational ‘ambidexterity'. However, we have retained the emphasis on the foundations of the subject. Six of the 19 cases at the end of the chapter are new (but the old ones are still available on the web site), and provide an up-to-date selection of operations issues. Operations Management focuses on the sustainable and socially responsible imperatives of operations management, using over 120 cases and illustrations of real-life operations around the world, including Apple, M\'edecins Sans Fronti\`eres, Amazon, Ecover, Dyson, Disneyland Paris, Google, The North Face, and many more.

abstract = {Introduction Security is a critical concern around the world that arises in protecting our ports, airports, transportation or other critical national infrastructure, curtailing the illegal flow of drugs, weapons, and money, and suppressing urban crime, as well as in protecting wildlife, fish, and forests from poachers and smugglers; and it arises in problems ranging from physical to cyber-physical systems. In all of these challenges, we have limited security resources that prevent full security coverage at all times. Instead, limited security resources must be deployed intelligently, taking into account differences in priorities of targets requiring security coverage, the responses of adversaries to the security posture, and potential uncertainty over the types, capabilities, knowledge, and priorities of adversaries faced. Game theory is well suited to adversarial reasoning for security resource allocation and scheduling problems. Casting the problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game in consideration of uncertainties, we have developed new algorithms for efficiently solving such games to provide randomized patrolling or inspection strategies. These algorithms have led to some initial successes in this arena, leading to advances over previous approaches in security resource scheduling and allocation, e.g., by addressing key weaknesses of predictability of human schedulers. These algorithms are now deployed in multiple applications: ARMOR has been deployed at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) since 2007 to randomize checkpoints on the roadways entering the airport and canine patrol routes within the airport terminals (Pita et al., 2008); IRIS is a game-theoretic scheduler for randomized deployment of the U.S. Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) requiring significant scale-up in underlying algorithms that has been in use since 2009 (Tsai, Rathi, Kiekintveld, Ord\'o\~nez, & Tambe, 2009); and PROTECT, which requires further scale-up, is deployed for generating randomized patrol schedules for the U.S. Coast Guard in Boston, New York, Los Angeles, and other ports around the United States (An et al., 2013; An, Pita, Shieh, Tambe, Kiekintveld, & Marecki, 2011; Shieh et al., 2012). Furthermore, TRUSTS is being evaluated for deterring fare evasion, suppressing urban crime, and counterterrorism within the Los Angeles Metro System (Jiang, Nguyen, Tambe, & Procaccia, 2013; Zin & Tambe, 2012), and GUARDS was earlier tested by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for security inside the airport (Pita, Tambe, Kiekintveld, Cullen, & Steigerwald, 2011).},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:90-5. Objective: To compare the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions in male veterans aging with spinal cord injury (SCI) with that of older men comparison groups. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: National community dwelling. Participants: Men 65 years and older (veterans with SCI [n=794] injured at least 20y, veterans [n=13,528], and general population [n=6105]). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Results: In older adult men with SCI, prevalences of diabetes, MI, stroke, and CHD were 20.30%, 18.70%, 9.84%, and 15.47%, respectively. The odds for stroke were 1.4 times higher in veterans with SCI than general veterans (P <.05), and there was a trend to higher odds for stroke in men with SCI than in the general population (P=.06). The odds for CHD were significantly lower for veterans with SCI than both comparison groups. Being a past smoker was associated with greater odds for diabetes, MI, and CHD, and being a current smoker was associated with higher odds for stroke. High blood pressure and high cholesterol levels were associated with higher odds for all conditions examined. Conclusions: Diabetes and MI were most prevalent in older adults, but the presence was similar in men with SCI (vs other men). In older adult men, SCI appeared to be protective of CHD. Stroke was most prevalent in veterans with SCI, and controlling for demographic and risk factors, SCI was associated independently with stroke. These findings may be useful for prioritizing preventive health strategies and planning long-term care for men aging with SCI.},

abstract = {In mathematics, the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) is a form of Fourier analysis that is applicable to the uniformly-spaced samples of a continuous function. The term discrete-time refers to the fact that the transform operates on discrete data (samples) whose interval often has units of time. From only the samples, it produces a function of frequency that is a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform of the original continuous function. Under certain theoretical conditions, described by the sampling theorem, the original continuous function can be recovered perfectly from the DTFT and thus from the original discrete samples. The DTFT itself is a continuous function of frequency, but discrete samples of it can be readily calculated via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) (see Sampling the DTFT), which is by far the most common method of modern Fourier analysis.\nBoth transforms are invertible. The inverse DTFT is the original sampled data sequence. The inverse DFT is a periodic summation of the original sequence. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm for computing one cycle of the DFT, and its inverse produces one cycle of the inverse DFT.},

abstract = {We recently presented a new model for singing synthesis based on a modified version of theWaveNet architecture. Instead of modeling raw waveform, we model features produced by a parametric vocoder that separates the influence of pitch and timbre. This allows conveniently modifying pitch to match any target melody, facilitates training on more modest dataset sizes, and significantly reduces training and generation times. Nonetheless, compared to modeling waveform directly, ways of effectively handling higher-dimensional outputs, multiple feature streams and regularization become more important with our approach. In this work, we extend our proposed system to include additional components for predicting F0 and phonetic timings from a musical score with lyrics. These expression-related features are learned together with timbrical features from a single set of natural songs. We compare our method to existing statistical parametric, concatenative, and neural network-based approaches using quantitative metrics as well as listening tests.},

Material change is often regarded as ‘damage' or ‘degradation', but has potential to be used as a tool to engender emotional engagement to an object. We present a framework for designers to better understand how materials change with use, and in turn how people respond to materials as they change. Key challenges are identified which must be overcome to use this framework in design practice–people's physical interaction with objects is poorly understood, it is difficult to simulate material change, materials resources for designers do not provide information about material change, and people's responses to aged materials depend on a complex web of interacting factors.},

abstract = {The prediction of near surface wind speed is becoming increasingly vital for the operation of electrical energy grids as the capacity of installed wind power grows. The majority of predictive wind speed modeling has focused on point-based time-series forecasting. Effectively balancing demand and supply in the presence of distributed wind turbine electricity generation, however, requires the prediction of wind fields in space and time. Additionally, predictions of full wind fields are particularly useful for future power planning such as the optimization of electricity power supply systems. In this paper, we propose a composite artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the 6-hour and 24-hour ahead average wind speed over a large area (-3.15×106km2). The ANN model consists of a convolutional input layer, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden layer, and a transposed convolutional layer as the output layer. We compare the ANN model with two non-parametric models, a null persistence model and a mean value model, and find that the ANN model has substantially smaller error than each of these models. Additionally, the ANN model also generally performs better than integrated autoregressive moving average models, which are trained for optimal performance in specific locations.},

abstract = {The negative effects on the environment of the intensive use of synthetic, oil-derived plastics to make products have given renewed impetus to the search for biopolymers derived from vegetable, animal or microbial matter that could prove to be a sound alternative in a number of applications. However, the real challenge is to create new materials from food waste and not from specially grown crops, whose production in any case comes at an environmental cost. In recent years, the testing of substances made from food waste has increased significantly; the sheer abundance of raw materials that can be used to make them has encouraged institutional research, as well as an approach to project development that has been widely embraced by the many young designers who craft these materials. This paper considers all aspects of these materials, starting from a historical overview. It presents interesting experiments underway and envisages possible future scenarios.},

abstract = {Deep learning has been found to be vulnerable to changes in the data distribution. This means that inputs that have an imperceptibly and immeasurably small difference from training data correspond to a completely different class label in deep learning. Thus an existing deep learning network like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is vulnerable to adversarial examples. We design an adversarial learning algorithm for supervised learning in general and CNNs in particular. Adversarial examples are generated by a game theoretic formulation on the performance of deep learning. In the game, the interaction between an intelligent adversary and deep learning model is a two-person sequential noncooperative Stackelberg game with stochastic payoff functions. The Stackelberg game is solved by the Nash equilibrium which is a pair of strategies (learner weights and genetic operations) from which there is no incentive for either learner or adversary to deviate. The algorithm performance is evaluated under different strategy spaces on MNIST handwritten digits data. We show that the Nash equilibrium leads to solutions robust to subsequent adversarial data manipulations. Results suggest that game theory and stochastic optimization algorithms can be used to study performance vulnerabilities in deep learning models.},

To make the problem well-posed, we augment the cost functional of the DNN by adding an appropriate shape regularization: the sum of the second-order total-variations of the trainable nonlinearities. The representer theorem for DNNs tells us that the optimal activation functions are adaptive piecewise-linear splines, which allows us to recast the problem as a parametric optimization. The challenging point is that the corresponding basis functions (ReLUs) are poorly conditioned and that the determination of their number and positioning is also part of the problem. We circumvent the difficulty by using an equivalent B-spline basis to encode the activation functions and by expressing the regularization as an $ell _1$-penalty. This results in the specification of parametric activation function modules that can be implemented and optimized efficiently on standard development platforms. We present experimental results that demonstrate the benefit of our approach.},

abstract = {We study the wave equation for a string with stiffness. We solve the equation and provide a uniqueness theorem with suitable boundary conditions. For a pinned string we compute the spectrum, which is slightly inharmonic. Therefore, the widespread scale of 12 equal divisions of the just octave is not the best choice to tune instruments like the piano. Basing on the theory of dissonance, we provide a way to tune the piano in order to improve its consonance. A good solution is obtained by tuning a note and its fifth by minimizing their beats.},

author = {Guido Fano and S M Blinder},
abstract = {Many years ago, my math teacher assigned me the task to give a presentation to the rest of the class. Time to prepare, 2 weeks; topic, group theory and its application to quantum mechanics. I politely observed that I had not yet had a course on quantum theory; I knew nothing about it. Teacher's reply was: "Well, you study it." His name was Guido Fano. This is how Guido Fano had me learning quantum theory. At home, alone, with a bunch of books on my desk, Dirac's one on top of all. I have been forever grateful to him, for this and much more. If I got into theoretical physics, it's thanks to him, the trust that I found, with surprise, from him. Today, when I realize that there is something that I should know and do not know (which of course happen contin- uously), I hear his voice in my mind saying "Well, you study it." But the second lesson I learned from Guido Fano, both about life and quantum theory, was even more crucial. After my presentation to the class, I thanked him and said: "I have now learned quantum mechanics." His reply was "No you haven't." How true. And not just because a couple of weeks couldn't suffice to digest the theory, but because nearly a century from Heisenberg and Dirac hasn't sufficed the community of us all to come to terms with this theory. In the months after my presentation, I kept discovering, first from Fano himself, and then over and over for the rest of my life, how multifaceted is this theory, and how slippery our actual understanding to it. The more I have learned about the theory, the less clear it has become. When comes the moment of saying what we really have learned about the world in finding that quantum mechanics works so effectively—well, we disagree among ourselves, and there are nearly as many opinions as physicists (not counting the philosophers). Long time later, with this new book on quantum theory, once again Guido Fano, together with his overseas colleague S.M. Blinder, opens up new sides of quantum mechanics for me. The beauty of this book, in my opinion, is that it merges very different traditions of thinking about the theory and teaching it. For a theory still so perplexing, this is what we need; in order to understand it better, to learn it better, but also to learn how to better use it. If had to start again learning quantum theory from scratch, as I did 40 years ago, I would do as I did: at home, alone, with many texts on my desk. But I would certainly have, next to Dirac's one, this book.},

Fast, efficient, and flexible, it is used to solve many problems. The upcoming version of C++ will see programmers change the way they code. If you want to grasp the practical usefulness of the C++17 STL in order to write smarter, fully portable code, then this book is for you.Beginning with new language features, this book will help you understand the language's mechanics and library features, and offers insight into how they work. Unlike other books, ours takes an implementation-specific, problem-solution approach that will help you quickly overcome hurdles. You will learn the core STL concepts, such as containers, algorithms, utility classes, lambda expressions, iterators, and more, while working on practical real-world recipes. These recipes will help you get the most from the STL and show you how to program in a better way.By the end of the book, you will be up to date with the latest C++17 features and save time and effort while solving tasks elegantly using the STL.What you will learnLearn about the new core language features and the problems they were intended to solveUnderstand the inner workings and requirements of iterators by implementing themExplore algorithms, functional programming style, and lambda expressionsLeverage the rich, portable, fast, and well-tested set of well-designed algorithms provided in the STLWork with strings the STL way instead of handcrafting C-style codeUnderstand standard support classes for concurrency and synchronization, and how to put them to workUse the filesystem library addition available with the C++17 STLAbout the AuthorJacek Galowicz obtained his master of science in electrical engineering/computer engineering at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. While at university, he enjoyed working as a student assistant in teaching and research, and he participated in several scientific publications. During and after his studies, he worked as a freelancer and implemented applications as well as kernel drivers in C and C++, touching various areas, including 3D graphics programming, databases, network communication, and physics simulation. In recent years, he has been programming performance- and security-sensitive microkernel operating systems for Intel x86 virtualization at Intel and FireEye in Braunschweig, Germany. He has a strong passion for modern C++ implementations of low-level software, and he tries hard to combine high performance with an elegant coding style. Learning purely functional programming and Haskell in recent years triggered his drive to implement generic code with the aid of meta programming.Table of ContentsThe New C++17 FeaturesSTL ContainersIteratorsLambda ExpressionsSTL Algorithm BasicsAdvanced Use of STL AlgorithmsStrings, Stream Classes, and Regular ExpressionsUtility ClasssesParallelism and ConcurrencyFilesystem},

The paper presents a case to illustrate the proposed methodology. Design/methodology/approach: The research method is a qualitative and quantitative mixture and it is presented as a study case. Bibliographic research is used to construct the theoretical framework. There are a number of studies that develop a sensibility analysis in MCDA modelling; however, none of them explore the robustness of the MCDA solution with use of scenarios variation. Findings: The methodology allows the criteria that must be taken into account, according to the decision makers' values and preferences. It is interesting to note that, depending on the scenario, different weights were applied for each criterion, and the performances of alternatives under each criterion has changed as well. Practical implications: This need arises in decision problems that are susceptible to the influence of scenario variation. Originality/value: This proposal was applied to a real case that has taken into account six alternatives, with a prospective analysis of three scenarios, evaluated by four criteria. The authors use prospective scenarios to choose the criterion weights and alternatives evaluation.},

@online{2017Improving,
author = {Issue July},
abstract = {Most successful examples of neural nets today are trained with supervision. However, to achieve high accuracy, the training sets need to be large, diverse, and accurately annotated, which is costly. An alternative to labelling huge amounts of data is to use synthetic images from a simulator. This is cheap as there is no labeling cost, but the synthetic images may not be realistic enough, resulting in poor generalization on real test images. To help close this performance gap, we've developed a method for refining synthetic images to make them look more realistic. We show that training models on these refined images leads to significant improvements in accuracy on various machine learning tasks.},

In this study we evaluated a number of multi-criteria decision-making tools for their usefulness using incentive-based experiments, which is a novel approach in operations research but common in psychology and experimental economics. In this experiment the participants were asked to compare five coffee shops to win a voucher for their best-rated shop. We found that, although the usefulness of different multi-criteria decision-making tools varied to some extent, all the tools were found to be useful in the sense that, when they decided to change their ranking, they followed the recommendation of the multi-criteria decision-making tool. Moreover, the level of inconsistency in the judgements provided had no significant effect on the usefulness of these tools.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are currently among the most commonly used classifiers. Despite easily achieving very good performance, one of the best selling points of these models is their modular design - one can conveniently adapt their architecture to specific needs, change connectivity patterns, attach specialised layers, experiment with a large amount of activation functions, normalisation schemes and many others. While one can find impressively wide spread of various configurations of almost every aspect of the deep nets, one element is, in authors' opinion, underrepresented - while solving classification problems, vast majority of papers and applications simply use log loss. In this paper we try to investigate how particular choices of loss functions a ect deep models and their learning dynamics, as well as resulting classifiers robustness to various e ects. We perform experiments on classical datasets, as well as provide some additional, theoretical insights into the problem. In particular we show that L1and L2losses are, quite surprisingly, justified classification objectives for deep nets, by providing probabilistic interpretation in terms of expected misclassification. We also introduce two losses which are not typically used as deep nets objectives and show that they are viable alternatives to the existing ones.},

abstract = {The possibility to fabricate materials from living organisms offers appealing advantages for product design, such as higher sustainability and an interesting novel aesthetics. Several designers are now 'growing' their own materials. Despite the large interest shown, this emerging material practice is still scarcely understood in design literature. The aim of this paper is to shed light on what it means to design with growing organisms as collaborators, identifying the defining traits of this novel, designerly way of 'doing materials'. To do so, we first compare this specific approach to the approaches of others working in the intersections of biology and design. In this way, we outline the boundaries of Growing Design, defining its unique characteristics. We then provide detailed descriptions of three classes of Growing Materials: fungal, bacterial and algal materials. For each class, we bring two examples of designers utilizing these materials for industrial design purposes. This helps to further explain what truly distinguishes Growing Materials from other conventional materials and to understand the challenges in working with them. Finally, this discussion enables us to set out a research agenda for Growing Design, supporting the development of these materials for industrial production.},

Fictitious play algorithm, first proposed by Brown in 1951, is a popular theoretical model of training agents. However, it is not applicable to larger systems with imperfect information due to its computational complexity. In this paper we propose a modification of the algorithm. We use neural networks for fast approximate calculation of the best responses. An important feature of the algorithm is the absence of agent's a priori knowledge about the system. Agents' learning goes through trial and error with winning actions being reinforced and entered into the training set and losing actions being cut from the strategy. The proposed algorithm has been used in a small game with imperfect information. And the ability of the algorithm to remove iteratively dominated strategies of agents' behavior has been demonstrated.},

abstract = {To achieve general intelligence, agents must learn how to interact with others in a shared environment: this is the challenge of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). The simplest form is independent reinforcement learning (InRL), where each agent treats its experience as part of its (non-stationary) environment. In this paper, we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit to the other agents' policies during training, failing to sufficiently generalize during execution. We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle, and fictitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings: gridworld coordination games and poker.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a frequency domain neural network for image super-resolution. The network employs the convolution theorem so as to cast convolutions in the spatial domain as products in the frequency domain. Moreover, the non-linearity in deep nets, often achieved by a rectifier unit, is here cast as a convolution in the frequency domain. This not only yields a network which is very computationally efficient at testing but also one whose parameters can all be learnt accordingly. The network can be trained using back propagation and is devoid of complex numbers due to the use of the Hartley transform as an alternative to the Fourier transform. Moreover, the network is potentially applicable to other problems elsewhere in computer vision and image processing which are often cast in the frequency domain. We show results on super-resolution and compare against alternatives elsewhere in the literature. In our experiments, our network is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the alternatives with an imperceptible loss of performance.},

abstract = {3D human articulated pose recovery from monocular image sequences is very challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions, and also the human 3D pose is inherently ambiguous from the monocular imagery. It is thus critical to exploit rich spatial and temporal long-range dependencies among body joints for accurate 3D pose sequence prediction. Existing approaches usually manually design some elaborate prior terms and human body kinematic constraints for capturing structures, which are often insufficient to exploit all intrinsic structures and not scalable for all scenarios. In contrast, this paper presents a Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machine(RPSM) to automatically learn the image-dependent structural constraint and sequence-dependent temporal context by using a multi-stage sequential refinement. At each stage, our RPSM is composed of three modules to predict the 3D pose sequences based on the previously learned 2D pose representations and 3D poses: (i) a 2D pose module extracting the image-dependent pose representations, (ii) a 3D pose recurrent module regressing 3D poses and (iii) a feature adaption module serving as a bridge between module (i) and (ii) to enable the representation transformation from 2D to 3D domain. These three modules are then assembled into a sequential prediction framework to refine the predicted poses with multiple recurrent stages. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M dataset and HumanEva-I dataset show that our RPSM outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches for 3D pose estimation.},

abstract = {We propose a practical method for L0norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of L0regularization. However, since the L0norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected L0regularized objective is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the hard concrete distribution for the gates, which is obtained by "stretching" a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

As GANs are difficult to train much research has focused on this. However, very little of this research has directly exploited gametheoretic techniques. We introduce Generative Adversarial Network Games (GANGs), which explicitly model a finite zero-sum game between a generator (G) and classifier (C) that use mixed strategies. The size of these games precludes exact solution methods, therefore we define resource-bounded best responses (RBBRs), and a resourcebounded Nash Equilibrium (RB-NE) as a pair of mixed strategies such that neitherG orC can find a better RBBR. The RB-NE solution concept is richer than the notion of 'local Nash equilibria' in that it captures not only failures of escaping local optima of gradient descent, but applies to any approximate best response computations, including methods with random restarts. To validate our approach, we solve GANGs with the Parallel Nash Memory algorithm, which provably monotonically converges to an RB-NE. We compare our results to standard GAN setups, and demonstrate that our method deals well with typical GAN problems such as mode collapse, partial mode coverage and forgetting.},

abstract = {The stochastic knapsack problem is a stochastic resource allocation problem that arises frequently and yet is exceptionally hard to solve. We derive and study an optimistic planning algorithm specifically designed for the stochastic knapsack problem. Unlike other optimistic planning algorithms for MDPs, our algorithm, OpStoK, avoids the use of discounting and is adaptive to the amount of resources available. We achieve this behavior by means of a concentration inequality that simultaneously applies to capacity and reward estimates. Crucially, we are able to guarantee that the aforementioned confidence regions hold collectively over all time steps by an application of Doob's inequality. We demonstrate that the method returns an -optimal solution to the stochastic knapsack problem with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first which provides such guarantees for the stochastic knapsack problem. Furthermore, our algorithm is an anytime algorithm and will return a good solution even if stopped prematurely. This is particularly important given the difficulty of the problem. We also provide theoretical conditions to guarantee OpStoK does not expand all policies and demonstrate favorable performance in a simple experimental setting.},

abstract = {The choice of activation functions in deep networks has a significant effect on the training dynamics and task performance. Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, f(x) = x sigmoid($\beta$x), which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

abstract = {Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.},

abstract = {We propose stochastic, non-parametric activation functions that are fully learnable and individual to each neuron. Complexity and the risk of overfitting are controlled by placing a Gaussian process prior over these functions. The result is the Gaussian process neuron, a probabilistic unit that can be used as the basic building block for probabilistic graphical models that resemble the structure of neural networks. The proposed model can intrinsically handle uncertainties in its inputs and self-estimate the confidence of its predictions. Using variational Bayesian inference and the central limit theorem, a fully deterministic loss function is derived, allowing it to be trained as efficiently as a conventional neural network using mini-batch gradient descent. The posterior distribution of activation functions is inferred from the training data alongside the weights of the network. The proposed model favorably compares to deep Gaussian processes, both in model complexity and efficiency of inference. It can be directly applied to recurrent or convolutional network structures, allowing its use in audio and image processing tasks. As an preliminary empirical evaluation we present experiments on regression and classification tasks, in which our model achieves performance comparable to or better than a Dropout regularized neural network with a fixed activation function. Experiments are ongoing and results will be added as they become available.},

We also added a confusion network rescoring step after system combination. The resulting system yields a 5.1% word error rate on the 2000 Switchboard evaluation set.},

abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks are showing much promise in many sub-areas of natural language processing, ranging from document classification to machine translation to automatic question answering. Despite their promise, many recurrent models have to read the whole text word by word, making it slow to handle long documents. For example, it is difficult to use a recurrent network to read a book and answer questions about it. In this paper, we present an approach of reading text while skipping irrelevant information if needed. The underlying model is a recurrent network that learns how far to jump after reading a few words of the input text. We employ a standard policy gradient method to train the model to make discrete jumping decisions. In our benchmarks on four different tasks, including number prediction, sentiment analysis, news article classification and automatic Q&A, our proposed model, a modified LSTM with jumping, is up to 6 times faster than the standard sequential LSTM, while maintaining the same or even better accuracy.},

However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G: X → Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F: Y → X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to enforce F(G(X)) ≈ X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {A thorough guide to the classical and contemporary mathematical methods of modern signal and image processing. Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets presents a thorough introduction to the mathematical foundations of signal and image processing. Key concepts and applications are addressed in a thought-provoking manner and are implemented using vector, matrix, and linear algebra methods. With a balanced focus on mathematical theory and computational techniques, this self-contained book equips readers with the essential knowledge needed to transition smoothly from mathematical models to practical digital data applications. The book first establishes a complete vector space and matrix framework for analyzing signals and images. Classical methods such as the discrete Fourier transform, the discrete cosine transform, and their application to JPEG compression are outlined followed by coverage of the Fourier series and the general theory of inner product spaces and orthogonal bases. The book then addresses convolution, filtering, and windowing techniques for signals and images. Finally, modern approaches are introduced, including wavelets and the theory of filter banks as a means of understanding the multiscale localized analysis underlying the JPEG 2000 compression standard.. Throughout the book, examples using image compression demonstrate how mathematical theory translates into application. Additional applications such as progressive transmission of images, image denoising, spectrographic analysis, and edge detection are discussed. Each chapter provides a series of exercises as well as a MATLAB project that allows readers to apply mathematical concepts to solving real problems. Additional MATLAB routines are available via the book's related Web site. With its insightful treatment of the underlying mathematics in image compression and signal processing, Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets is an ideal book for mathematics, engineering, and computer science courses at the upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for mathematicians, engineers, and other practitioners who would like to learn more about the relevance of mathematics in digital data processing.},

One of the most promising approaches is the fabrication of materials from living organisms, such as fungi and bacteria. An increasing number of designers are engaging in this Growing Design practice, exploring the unique potentials of the grown materials for product design. In Growing Design, designers operate in interdisciplinary contexts, engaging in early stage material developments. Despite the widespread interest towards Growing Design, no systematic study has been conducted so far to understand how this practice unfolds and its contribution to the progression towards cleaner production. To this end, eight recognized professionals in the field were interviewed. The results illustrate how the conception of materials in design evolves when designers co-perform with biological organisms. This alters how the design process unfolds and the mindset adopted in design practice, shaping a novel, systemic vision on production and consumption practices. The paper further discusses the need for developing new sensibilities to face complex interdisciplinary problems in Growing Design and highlights the role designers can take in developing new materials for sustainable production.},

The traditional training of neural networks depends generally on the error back propagation method to iteratively tune all the parameters. When the number of hidden layers increases, this kind of training has many problems such as slow convergence, time consuming, and local minima. To avoid these problems, neural networks with random weights (NNRW) are proposed in which the weights between the hidden layer and input layer are randomly selected and the weights between the output layer and hidden layer are obtained analytically. Researchers have shown that NNRW has much lower training complexity in comparison with the traditional training of feed-forward neural networks. This paper objectively reviews the advantages and disadvantages of NNRW model, tries to reveal the essence of NNRW, gives our comments and remarks on NNRW, and provides some useful guidelines for users to choose a mechanism to train a feed-forward neural network.},

Accompanying this recognition of the central role of knowledge in today's economies has been an added focus on information, technology, learning and the accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance that results therefrom. Closely connected to these developments has been the advent of big data; and as information becomes available at greater volumes and higher speed, the focus is shifting from quantity to the quality of the information collected and the manner in which it is used. In this respect, Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques constitute valuable tools for structuring and evaluating complex decision situations, and can allow for more informed, potentially better decisions. MCDA techniques are able to build on the knowledge of expert participants in a given field, and produce assessment systems based on values and experience. Constructivist in nature, this approach has grown exponentially over the past few decades, causing a change in the decision-making arena in general, and in the field of decision support systems (DSS) in particular.

abstract = {Scene representation—the process of converting visual sensory data into concise descriptions—is a requirement for intelligent behavior. Recent work has shown that neural networks excel at this task when provided with large, labeled datasets. However, removing the reliance on human labeling remains an important open problem. To this end, we introduce the Generative Query Network (GQN), a framework within which machines learn to represent scenes using only their own sensors. The GQN takes as input images of a scene taken from different viewpoints, constructs an internal representation, and uses this representation to predict the appearance of that scene from previously unobserved viewpoints. The GQN demonstrates representation learning without human labels or domain knowledge, paving the way toward machines that autonomously learn to understand the world around them.},

abstract = {To achieve an advanced Internet of Things (IoT), it is necessary to combine artificial intelligence (AI) with IoT. Compact circuits that can operate AI functions will be useful for this purpose. Therefore, we propose stochastic weights binary neural networks (SWBNN). SWBNNs are more accurate than binary neural networks (BNN) with small circuits. BNNs can be realized with small circuits since binary calculation needs simpler circuits than real number calculation. However, BNNs have lower accuracy than networks with real numbers. Thus, the proposed SWBNNs are BNNs that behave stochastically, which makes them more accurate than BNNs. Moreover, SWBNNs can still be achieved with small circuits since they execute binary calculation. As a result, the accuracy for the test data of SWBNNs is closer to the accuracy for learning data than the accuracy for the test data of BNNs is. Especially when using the CIFAR10 database, the difference in the identification accuracy rate between learning data and test data decreased from 6% for BNNs to 2% for SWBNNs. From results of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation, circuits of SWBNNs are sufficiently small although they are 10% bigger than those of BNNs. Therefore, SWBNNs are more accurate than BNNs, and the circuit costs ofintroducing stochastic weights are low.},

abstract = {We propose a modification of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that generate illustrations of human figures from given poses represented by stick figures. In recent years, while various methods that generate images of characters using GANs have been proposed, it is not yet possible for users to freely designate poses of human figures. When generating an image of a character, the pose of the character takes is an important component of its composition. Thus it is necessary fora user who wants to create an illustration to be able to specify the pose easily. We collected a set of illustrations of human figures from the internet, and for each illustration, a simple line drawing that specifies the pose was drawn manually. We constructed a GAN that takes a line drawing as its input and creates an illustration of a person in a pose that matches the line drawing. These networks are learned using the data set we prepared. In this paper, we propose a new network architecture. After constructing two networks both of which have almost the same structure as pix2pix, which is a variant model of GANs, we stack up those networks based on the idea of stack GAN. The experimental results show that, from stick figures representing common poses such as a standing pose, our methods was able to successfully generate images of characters. However, in the case of stick figures having rare poses that were not in the dataset, such as figures raising a hand or lying down, the generated images were blurred and not of a high-quality but still had the desired shapes. By expanding the dataset to include various poses, it is possible to generate diverse poses more precisely.},

abstract = {Digital startups in the early stages of their development frequently undergo innovation to their value architecture and Business Model. A set of pragmatic methods drawing on lean and agile principles has recently been proposed to support digital entrepreneurs facing Business Model Innovation (BMI), known as Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs). However, the theoretical and practical relationship between BMI and LSAs in dynamic digital environments has seldom been investigated. To fill this gap, our study draws on an exploratory multiple-case study based on three digital multisided platform startups to craft a unified framework that can disclose the relationship between BMI, LSAs and Agile Development (AD), within the context of Strategic Agility. Our findings, which emerge from the unified framework, show that LSAs can be employed as agile methods to enable Business Model Innovation in Digital Entrepreneurship. These findings are then organized around a set of propositions, with the aim of developing a research agenda directed towards integrating BMI, LSAs and AD processes and methods.},

At low concentrations of hyaluroic acid, the collagen fibers were not fully coated, and areas of both hyaluroic acid and collagen were available for cell adhesion, either directly or through any mediating protein. Vitronectin (VN) is of interest because of its roles in cell adhesion and spreading, in coagulation, in complement activation, and in three important aspects of artificial surface induced thrombosis. The RGD-BSA conjugates were used to coat tissue culture plastic surfaces which then served as substrata in cell adhesion experiments. The surfaces of solvent-cast films of this polymer were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy by which surface chemical composition was quantitatively measured at the outermost layer of several tenths of angstroms, which determines biological responses including cell adhesion and growth.},

abstract = {During the last decade, much attention has been given to sound rendering and the simulation of acoustic phenomena by solving appropriate models described by Hamiltonian partial differential equations. In this contribution, we introduce a procedure to develop appropriate tools inspired from geometric integration in order to simulate musical sounds. Geometric integrators are numerical integrators of excellent quality that are designed exclusively for Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations. The introduced procedure is a combination of two techniques in geometric integration: the semi-discretization method by Celledoni et al. (J Comput Phys 231:6770–6789, 2012) and symplectic partitioned Runge–Kutta methods. This combination turns out to be a right procedure that derives numerical schemes that are effective and suitable for computation of musical sounds. By using this procedure we derive a series of explicit integration algorithms for a simple model describing piano sounds as a representative example for virtual instruments. We demonstrate the advantage of the numerical methods by evaluating a variety of numerical test cases.},

abstract = {We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CELEBA images at 10242. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8:80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CELEBA dataset.},

Similar to the text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) field, SVS systems have also been greatly improved since the deep neural network (DNN) framework was introduced. Although they share many parts of the framework, the main difference between TTS and SVS systems is that the feature composing method, between linguistic and musical features, is important for SVS systems. In this paper, we propose a Korean SVS system based on a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN). At the feature composing stage, we propose a novel composing method, based on Korean syllable structure. At the synthesis stage, we adopt LSTM-RNN for the SVS. According to our experiments, our composed feature improved the naturalness of the voice, specifically in any part that has to be pronounced for a long time. Furthermore, LSTM-RNN outperformed the DNN based SVS system in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.},

Here we characterise and quantify a major ocean plastic accumulation zone formed in subtropical waters between California and Hawaii: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). Our model, calibrated with data from multi-vessel and aircraft surveys, predicted at least 79 (45-129) thousand tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million km2; a figure four to sixteen times higher than previously reported. We explain this difference through the use of more robust methods to quantify larger debris. Over three-quarters of the GPGP mass was carried by debris larger than 5 cm and at least 46% was comprised of fishing nets. Microplastics accounted for 8% of the total mass but 94% of the estimated 1.8 (1.1-3.6) trillion pieces floating in the area. Plastic collected during our study has specific characteristics such as small surface-to-volume ratio, indicating that only certain types of debris have the capacity to persist and accumulate at the surface of the GPGP. Finally, our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.},

abstract = {Despite citation counts from Google Scholar (GS), Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus being widely consulted by researchers and sometimes used in research evaluations, there is no recent or systematic evidence about the differences between them. In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93/////// %–96/////// %), far ahead of Scopus (35/////// %–77/////// %) and WoS (27/////// %–73/////// %). GS found nearly all the WoS (95/////// %) and Scopus (92/////// %) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48/////// %–65/////// %), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19/////// %–38/////// %), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage.},

abstract = {For a musical instrument sound containing partials, or modes, the behavior of modes around the attack time is particularly important. However, accurately decomposing it around the attack time is not an easy task, especially when the onset is sharp. This is because spectra of the modes are peaky while the sharp onsets need a broad one. In this paper, an optimization-based method of modal decomposition is proposed to achieve accurate decomposition around the attack time. The proposed method is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to enforce the perfect reconstruction property which is important for accurate decomposition. For optimization, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized, where the update of variables is calculated in closed form. The proposed method realizes accurate modal decomposition in the simulation and real piano sounds.},

abstract = {Image classification has become one of the main tasks in the field of computer vision technologies. In this context, a recent algorithm called CapsNet that implements an approach based on activity vectors and dynamic routing between capsules may overcome some of the limitations of the current state of the art artificial neural networks (ANN) classifiers, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the CapsNet algorithm in comparison with three well-known classifiers (Fisherfaces, LeNet, and ResNet). We tested the classification accuracy on four datasets with a different number of instances and classes, including images of faces, traffic signs, and everyday objects. The evaluation results show that even for simple architectures, training the CapsNet algorithm requires significant computational resources and its classification performance falls below the average accuracy values of the other three classifiers. However, we argue that CapsNet seems to be a promising new technique for image classification, and further experiments using more robust computation resources and refined CapsNet architectures may produce better outcomes.},

abstract = {Drilling problems such as stick slip vibration/hole cleaning, pipe failures, loss of circulation, BHA whirl, stuck pipe incidents, excessive torque and drag, low ROP, bit wear, formation damage and borehole instability, and the drilling of highly tortuous wells have only been tackled using physics-based models. Despite the mammoth generation of real-time metadata, there is a tremendous gap between statistical based models and empirical, mathematical, and physical-based models. Data mining techniques have made prominent contributions across a broad spectrum of industries. Its value is widely appreciated in a variety of applications, but its potential has not been fully tapped in the oil and gas industry. This paper presents a review compiling several years of Data Analytics applications in the drilling operations. This review discusses the benefits, deficiencies of the present practices, challenges, and novel applications under development to overcome industry deficiencies. This study encompasses a comprehensive compilation of data mining algorithms and industry applications from a predictive analytics standpoint using supervised and unsupervised advanced analytics algorithms to identify hidden patterns and help mitigate drilling challenges. Traditional data preparation and analysis methods are not sufficiently capable of rapid information extraction and clear visualization of big complicated data sets. Due to the petroleum industry's unfulfilled demand, Machine Learning (ML)-assisted industry workflow in the fields of drilling optimization and real time parameter analysis and mitigation is presented. This paper summarizes data analytics case studies, workflows, and lessons learnt that would allow field personnel, engineers, and management to quickly interpret trends, detect failure patterns in operations, diagnose problems, and execute remedial actions to monitor and safeguard operations. The presence of such a comprehensive workflow can minimize tool failure, save millions in replacement costs and maintenance, NPV, lost production, minimize industry bias, and drive intelligent business decisions. This study will identify areas of improvement and opportunities to mitigate malpractices. Data exploitation via the proposed platform is based on well-established ML and data mining algorithms in computer sciences and statistical literature. This approach enables safe operations and handling of extremely large data bases, hence, facilitating tough decision-making processes.},

abstract = {In today's data-driven economy, operators that integrate vast stores of fundamental reservoir and production data with the highperformance predictive analytics solutions can emerge as winners in the contest of maximizing estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The scope of this study is to demonstrate a new workflow coupling earth sciences with data analytics to operationalize well completion optimization. The workflow aims to build a robust predictive model that allows users to perform sensitivity analysis on completion designs within a few hours. Current workflows for well completion and production optimization in unconventional reservoirs require extensive earth modeling, fracture simulation, and production simulations. With considerable effort and wide scale of sensitivity, studies could enable optimized well completion design parameters such as optimal cluster spacing, optimal proppant loading, optimal well spacing, etc. Yet, today, less than 5% of the wells fractured in North America are designed using advanced simulation due to the required level of data, skillset, and long computing times. Breaking these limitations through parallel fracture and reservoir simulations in the cloud and combining such simulation with data analytics and artificial intelligence algorithms helped in the development of a powerful solution that creates models for fast, yet effective, completion design. The approach was executed on Eagle Ford wells as a case study in 2016. Over 2000 data points were collected with completion sensitivity performed on a multithreaded cluster environment on these wells. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms of data analytics such as random forest, gradient boost, linear regression, etc. were applied on the data points to create a proxy model for the fracturing and numerical production simulator. With the gradient boost technique, over 90% accuracy was achieved between the proxy model and the actual results. Hence, the proxy model could predict the wellbore productivity accurately for any given change in completion design. The operators now had a much simpler model, which served as a plug-and-play tool for the completion engineers to evaluate the impact of changes in completion parameters on the future well performance and making fast-tracked economic decisions almost in real time. The approach can be replicated for varying geological and geomechanical properties as operations move from pad to pad. Although the need for heavy computing resource, simulation skillset, and long run times was eliminated with this new approach, regular QA/QC of the model through manual simulations makes the process more robust and reliable. The methodology provides an integrated approach to bridge the traditional reservoir understanding and simulation approach to the new big data approach to create proxies, which allows operators to make quicker decisions for completion optimization. The technique presented in this paper can be extended for other domains of wellsite operations such as well drilling, artificial lift, etc. and help operators evaluate the most economical scenario in close to real time.},

abstract = {Directional drilling is a complex process involving the remote control of tool alignment and force application to a very long drill string subject to variable external forces. Controlling bit tool face orientation while ensuring adequate rate of penetration (ROP) is quite challenging, with aspects that have been described as more art than science. Improving this control helps preserve proper well trajectory and eliminate deviations that require corrective measures and add to well costs. An artificial intelligence system was developed to learn from the actions of expert directional drillers and the mechanics of drilling simulations. Machine learning algorithms were employed to improve the efficiency of directional drilling: optimized ROP, less tortuous borehole, less personnel on board (POB), and consistency across operations. The system ingests historical and simulation data corresponding to the information used and actions taken by expert directional drillers and uses that data to generate decisions that result in efficient slide drilling. To create a system for controlling tool face angle and guiding drill bit sliding during directional drilling, relevant historical data from directional drilling operations was gathered. Much of this data was recorded in the drilling logs, which the drilling operator traditionally uses to control drilling parameters. The collected data was then filtered and used to structure and train artificial neural networks and select appropriate hyperparameters. Reinforcement learning methods were used to refine the neural networks trained on historical data. A computational model for drill string physics was used to simulate the mechanics of directional drilling. A successfully trained network was considered one that minimized deviation from planned wellbore trajectory, minimized tortuosity, and maximized ROP. The neural network developed could replicate the decisions of expert directional drillers within a small error (<3%). Reinforcement learning was then successfully used to improve network performance, particularly for conditions not previously considered. Since the algorithm has demonstrated competence in the historical and simulated realms, it will be further tested as a real-time advisory system for control of directional drilling operations. The system will be tested in simulation with an expert directional driller before use in a field drilling operation. Ultimately, the algorithm can be directly integrated into drilling operations, enabling fully automated directional drilling.},

Due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, PHAs have a wide range of applications in various industries such as biomedical sector including tissue engineering, bio-implant patches, drug delivery, surgery and wound dressing. PHAs are green plastics and they have positive social and environmental impact when compared with conventional plastics in terms of production and recycling. Moreover, PHAs do not possess acute and chronic health effects when used in vivo. These bioplastics represent a renewable and sustainable resource to reduce landfill requirements without being persistence or causing pollution. A wide range of carbon sources, bacterial strains, fermentation conditions and recovery methods have been purposed by various researchers for better yield and economical perspectives. Recent advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering has led to the production of PHAs from non-PHAs producing strains with no toxins. Progression in recovery techniques has improved the extraction efficacy from biomass with high purity. This review outlines production and characteristics of PHAs, developments in their production, and applications in various industries including nanotechnology.},

abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks have shown impressive success in very different application caseS. Choosing a proper network architecture is a critical decision for a network's success, usually done in a manual manner. As a straightforward strategy, large, mostly fully connected architectures are selected, thereby relying on a good optimization strategy to find proper weights while at the same time avoiding overfitting. However, large parts of the final network are redundant. In the best case, large parts of the network become simply irrelevant for later inferencing. In the worst case, highly parameterized architectures hinder proper optimization and allow the easy creation of adverserial examples fooling the network. A first step in removing irrelevant architectural parts lies in identifying those parts, which requires measuring the contribution of individual components such as neuronS. In previous work, heuristics based on using the weight distribution of a neuron as contribution measure have shown some success, but do not provide a proper theoretical understanding. Therefore, in our work we investigate game theoretic measures, namely the shapley value (sV), in order to separate relevant from irrelevant parts of an artificial neural network. We begin by designing a coalitional game for an artificial neural network, where neurons form coalitions and the average contributions of neurons to coalitions yield to the shapley value. In order to measure how well the shapley value measures the contribution of individual neurons, we remove low-contributing neurons and measure its impact on the network performance. In our experiments we show that the shapley value outperforms other heuristics for measuring the contribution of neuronS.},

abstract = {We introduce new theoretical insights into two-population asymmetric games allowing for an elegant symmetric decomposition into two single population symmetric games. Specifically, we show how an asymmetric bimatrix game (A,B) can be decomposed into its symmetric counterparts by envisioning and investigating the payoff tables (A and B) that constitute the asymmetric game, as two independent, single population, symmetric games. We reveal several surprising formal relationships between an asymmetric two-population game and its symmetric single population counterparts, which facilitate a convenient analysis of the original asymmetric game due to the dimensionality reduction of the decomposition. The main finding reveals that if (x,y) is a Nash equilibrium of an asymmetric game (A,B), this implies that y is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table A, and x is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table B. Also the reverse holds and combinations of Nash equilibria of the counterpart games form Nash equilibria of the asymmetric game. We illustrate how these formal relationships aid in identifying and analysing the Nash structure of asymmetric games, by examining the evolutionary dynamics of the simpler counterpart games in several canonical examples.},

Bioplastic can help reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and petroleum, that bioplastic can solve the problem of synthetic plastic use. This research aims to define the properties of the cassava starch-based bioplastic reinforced by nanoclay. Methods were experimental with bioplastic component of cassava starch, glycerol as plasticizer and nanoclay as reinforcement. The bioplastic was analyzed using XRD, tensile test, moisture absorption, biodegradability, and compared with another bioplastic. The results show that the addition of nanoclay into bioplastic results increasing the tensile strength of bioplastic also increases from 5.2 MPa to 6.3 MPa. This research revealed that complete degradation of nanoclay reinforced bioplastic could be achieved on the 6th day.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are successfully used in a number of applications. However, their storage and computational requirements have largely prevented their widespread use on mobile devices. Here we present a series of approaches for compressing and speeding up CNNs in the frequency domain, which focuses not only on smaller weights but on all the weights and their underlying connections. By treating convolution filters as images, we decompose their representations in the frequency domain as common parts (i.e., cluster centers) shared by other similar filters and their individual private parts (i.e., individual residuals). A large number of low-energy frequency coefficients in both parts can be discarded to produce high compression without significantly compression romising accuracy. Furthermore, we explore a data-driven method for removing redundancies in both spatial and frequency domains, which allows us to discard more useless weights by keeping similar accuracies. After obtaining the optimal sparse CNN in the frequency domain, we relax the computational burden of convolution operations in CNNs by linearly combining the convolution responses of discrete cosine transform (DCT) bases. The compression and speed-up ratios of the proposed algorithm are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated on benchmark image datasets to demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has guided research on social dilemmas for decades. However, it distinguishes between only two atomic actions: cooperate and defect. In real-world prisoner's dilemmas, these choices are temporally extended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions, reflecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner's Dilemma (SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work, we propose a deep multiagent reinforcement learning approach that investigates the evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two phases. The first phase is offline: it synthesizes policies with different cooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The second phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the detected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the Apple-Pear game and the Fruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid being exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with cooperative opponents.},

abstract = {Efficient audio synthesis is an inherently difficult machine learning task, as human perception is sensitive to both global structure and fine-scale waveform coherence. Autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, model local structure but have slow iterative sampling and lack global latent structure. In contrast, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.1},

The model generates novel image sequences of that person, according to arbitrary user-defined control signals, typically marking the displacement of the moving body. The generated video can have an arbitrary background, and effectively capture both the dynamics and appearance of the person. The method is based on two networks. The first network maps a current pose, and a single-instance control signal to the next pose. The second network maps the current pose, the new pose, and a given background, to an output frame. Both networks include multiple novelties that enable high-quality performance. This is demonstrated on multiple characters extracted from various videos of dancers and athletes.},

Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to "wash away" semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has its roots in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which was the first successful attempt to validate transactions via a decentralized data protocol. This validation process requires vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant level of carbon emissions. Our approximation of Bitcoin's carbon footprint underlines the need to tackle the environmental externalities that result from cryptocurrencies. Blockchain solutions are increasingly discussed for a broad variety of use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. Although not all blockchain protocols are as energy intensive as Bitcoin's protocol, environmental aspects, the risk of collusion, and concerns about control must not be ignored in the debate on anticipated benefits. Our findings for the first stage of blockchain diffusion and the externalities we discuss may help policy-makers in setting the right rules as the adoption journey of blockchain technology has just started.},

abstract = {Driven by recent computer vision and robotic applications, recovering 3D human poses has become increasingly important and attracted growing interests. In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the proposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D and 2D human poses in a type of "free" self-supervision for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate 3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose projection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining geometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated 2D poses. Therefore, these two dual learning tasks enable our model to adaptively learn from 3D human pose data and external large-scale 2D human pose data. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop a 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship, temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our framework over all the compared competing methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a psychological contract perspective on the use of the open source development model as a global sourcing strategy-opensourcing, as we term it here-whereby commerical companies and open source communities collaborate on development of software of commercial interest to the company. Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product. We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness: The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises. It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.},

abstract = {The Information Age has a surfeit of information received relative to what is processed. We model multiple sectors competing for consumer attention, with competition in price within each sector. Sector advertising levels follow a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form, and within-sector prices are dispersed with a truncated Pareto distribution. The "information hump" shows highest ad levels for intermediate attention levels. Overall, advertising is excessive, although the allocation across sectors is optimal. The blame for information overload falls most on product categories with low information transmission costs and low profits. \textcopyright2012, RAND.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques for Sentiment Analysis have become very popular. They provide automatic feature extraction and both richer representation capabilities and better performance than traditional feature based techniques (i.e., surface methods). Traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. These long-established approaches can yield strong baselines, and their predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising deep learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of deep learning techniques integrating them with traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are sixfold. First, we develop a deep learning based sentiment classifier using a word embeddings model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on F1-Score.},

abstract = {We present Deep Voice, a production-quality text-to-speech system constructed entirely from deep neural networks. Deep Voice lays the groundwork for truly end-to-end neural speech synthesis. The system comprises five major building blocks: a segmentation model for locating phoneme boundaries, a grapheme-tophoneme conversion model, a phoneme duration prediction model, a fundamental frequency prediction model, and an audio synthesis model. For the segmentation model, wc propose a novel way of performing phoneme boundary detection with deep neural networks using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. For the audio synthesis model, we implement a variant of WaveNet that requires fewer parameters and trains faster than the original. By using a neural network for each component, our system is simpler and more flexible than traditional text-tospeech systems, where each component requires laborious feature engineering and extensive domain expertise. Finally, we show that inference with our system can be performed faster than real time and describe optimized WaveNet inference kernels on both CPU and GPU that achieve up to 400x speedups over existing implementations.},

abstract = {At the peak of the Internet frenzy two years ago, when the Nasdaq was over 5,000 and dotcom millionaires were buying spreads in the hills above Palo Alto, it seemed that the information revolution would go on forever. Little tech companies were popping up everywhere, and small investors were reaping returns that made them feel like geniuses. Then the bubble burst. It burst, management guru Peter Drucker tells us, because "the information industry as a business wasn't going anywhere." The information revolution had been hyped, exaggerated. Neither computers nor the Internet, Drucker says, had added much to the economy. Is the information economy going nowhere? Is its revolution over? In Silicon Valley, certainly, the prospects look bleak. But history suggests that such pessimism is misplaced --that the information revolution's best days might actually lie ahead.},

The model is based on the fundamental equations of a damped, stiff string interacting with a nonlinear hammer, from which a numerical finite difference scheme is derived. In the present study, the performance of the model is evaluated by systematic comparisons between measured and simulated piano tones. After a verification of the accuracy of the method, the model is used as a tool for systematically exploring the influence of string stiffness, relative striking position, and hammer-string mass ratio on string waveforms and spectra. \textcopyright 1994, Acoustical Society of America.

abstract = {Deep learning methods have resulted in significant performance improvements in several application domains and as such several software frameworks have been developed to facilitate their implementation. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning frameworks, namely Caffe, Neon, TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch, on three aspects: extensibility, hardware utilization, and speed. The study is performed on several types of deep learning architectures and we evaluate the performance of the above frameworks when employed on a single machine for both (multi-threaded) CPU and GPU (Nvidia Titan X) settings. The speed performance metrics used here include the gradient computation time, which is important during the training phase of deep networks, and the forward time, which is important from the deployment perspective of trained networks. For convolutional networks, we also report how each of these frameworks support various convolutional algorithms and their corresponding performance. From our experiments, we observe that Theano and Torch are the most easily extensible frameworks. We observe that Torch is best suited for any deep architecture on CPU, followed by Theano. It also achieves the best performance on the GPU for large convolutional and fully connected networks, followed closely by Neon. Theano achieves the best performance on GPU for training and deployment of LSTM networks. Caffe is the easiest for evaluating the performance of standard deep architectures. Finally, TensorFlow is a very flexible framework, similar to Theano, but its performance is currently not competitive compared to the other studied frameworks.},

abstract = {We describe an image compression method, consisting of a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.},

abstract = {Diminishing state resources coupled with inadequate urban management capacity and insufficiency of conventional approaches have rendered it impossible to provide basic infrastructure in urban areas in developing countries such as in the city of Dar es Salaam. In that situation fringe neighbourhoods are mostly hit. However, a notable phenomenon has emerged in informal and formal settlements where the communities, through self-help and local governance in their own neighbourhood associations, have organised to fill the gaps in infrastructure services left by the centralised institutions. Among other things, community groups mobilise and organise fund-raising, mutual self-help and external technical assistance to provide water supply and sanitation, roads and drainage channels within the immediate area. This seems to be a trend in infrastructure improvement in poor neighbourhoods including fringe settlements. Actors observed to be participating in the process of providing the basic services and facilities in some of the fringe settlements include Dar es Salaam City Council (DCC), the civil societies including political party organisations and private individuals as well as youth and women groups, and the donor community. This paper discusses the potentials and constraints existing in the provision of basic infrastructure to fringe settlements taking water management as an example. Potable water was chosen to explain the case because these settlements are not connected to the Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (DAWASA-a centralised institution) water supply system and are remotely located. The purpose is to inform policy makers, researchers and practitioners including water providers and managers and water users on potentials and constraints existing in the provision and management of water supply in remote poor communities. Potable water as an essential need plays a major role in health development and if water is not easily accessible much time is wasted to search for it. One of the questions to be answered is how the residents, most of them being poor, are coping up with the deficiency of water supply in their fringe areas. \textcopyright2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper applies recent developments in piano modeling and focuses on the issues related to practical implementation (e.g., numerical stability, aliasing, and efficiency). A strong emphasis is given to modeling nonlinear string vibrations, and a new variation of earlier synthesis techniques is proposed which is particularly well suited for modal synthesis. For soundboard modeling, the possibilities of using fast Fourier transform-based fast convolution and parallel second-order filters are discussed. Additionally, the paper describes the details of the software implementation and discusses the computational complexity of each model block.

We introduce Monte Carlo crogging which combines bootstrapping and cross-validation (CV) in a single approach through repeated random splitting of the original time series into mutually exclusive datasets for training. As the training/validation split is independent of the number of folds, the algorithm offers more flexibility in the size, and number of training samples compared to k-fold cross-validation. The study also provides for crogging and bagging: (1) the first systematic evaluation across time series length and combination size, (2) a bias and variance decomposition of the forecast errors to understand improvement gains, and (3) a comparison to established benchmarks of model averaging and selection. Crogging can easily be extended to other autoregressive models. Results on real and simulated series demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy especially for short time series and long forecast horizons.},

In this paper, a classification scheme and a comprehensive literature review are presented in order to uncover, classify, and interpret the current research on PROMETHEE methodologies and applications. Based on the scheme, 217 scholarly papers from 100 journals are categorized into application areas and non-application papers. The application areas include the papers on the topics of Environment Management, Hydrology and Water Management, Business and Financial Management, Chemistry, Logistics and Transportation, Manufacturing and Assembly, Energy Management, Social, and Other Topics. The last area covers the papers published in several fields: Medicine, Agriculture, Education, Design, Government and Sports. The scholarly papers are also classified by (1) year of publication, (2) journal of publication, (3) authors' nationality, (4) PROMETHEE as applied with other MCDA methods, and (5) PROMETHEE as applied with GAIA (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid) plane.

Inside, we use skip pooling to extract information at multiple scales and levels of abstraction. Through extensive experiments we evaluate the design space and provide readers with an overview of what tricks of the trade are important. ION improves state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2012 object detection from 73.9% to 77.9% mAP. On the new and more challenging MS COCO dataset, we improve state-of-the-art from 19.7% to 33.1% mAP. In the 2015 MS COCO Detection Challenge, our ION model won 'Best Student Entry' and finished 3rd place overall. As intuition suggests, our detection results provide strong evidence that context and multi-scale representations improve small object detection.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been a hot topic of research for many years there still are certain issues regarding the development of an ANN model, resulting in a lack of absolute guarantee that the model will perform well for the problem at hand. The multitude of different approaches that have been adopted in order to deal with this problem have investigated all aspects of the ANN modelling procedure, from training data collection and pre/post-processing to elaborate training schemes and algorithms. Increased attention is especially directed to proposing a systematic way to establish an appropriate architecture in contrast to the current common practice that calls for a repetitive trial-and-error process, which is time-consuming and produces uncertain results. This paper proposes such a methodology for determining the best architecture and is based on the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and the development of novel criteria that quantify an ANN's performance (both training and generalization) as well as its complexity. This approach is implemented in software and tested based on experimental data capturing workpiece elastic deflection in turning. The intention is to present simultaneously the approach's theoretical background and its practical application in real-life engineering problems. Results show that the approach performs better than a human expert, at the same time offering many advantages in comparison to similar approaches found in literature. \textcopyright2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The immunological correlates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-induced suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication have been investigated. 20 HIV-1-infected patients with mean CD4+ T cell count of 298/$\mu$l, plasma viral load of 4.7 log10 copies/ml and naive for protease inhibitors (PI) were studied during 12 months of HAART. An increased number of both CD4+ and CD8+ naive T cells and a normalization of the frequency of CCR5- and CXCR4-expressing CD4+ T cells were readily observed after starting therapy. Single cell analysis of cytokine production after 12 months of HAART showed an increased number of interleukin (IL)-2-, but not IL-4- and (IFN)-$\gamma$-, producing T cells and a decreased percentage of CD8+ IFN-$\gamma$ + cells. A correlation between the frequency of IFN-$\gamma$-producing T cells and that of memory, CCR5+ and CD95+ T cells was demonstrated in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. The diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) variable beta (BV) chain repertoire significantly increased after 12 months of HAART within the CD4+ but not the CD8+ T cell subset. However, the level of perturbation of the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3), was not significantly modified by effective therapy. The number of anti-HIV Gag and Pol cytotoxic T lymphocytes precursors (CTLp) decreased during HAART and highly correlated with the CD8 IFN-$\gamma$ response. Ameliorated clinical conditions were observed in all patients in absence of any opportunistic infections during all the study period. These observations indicate that a better restoration of immunity may be obtained in patients starting HAART at less advanced stages of the disease.},

abstract = {Feature selection is used in many application areas relevant to expert and intelligent systems, such as data mining and machine learning, image processing, anomaly detection, bioinformatics and natural language processing. Feature selection based on information theory is a popular approach due its computational efficiency, scalability in terms of the dataset dimensionality, and independence from the classifier. Common drawbacks of this approach are the lack of information about the interaction between the features and the classifier, and the selection of redundant and irrelevant features. The latter is due to the limitations of the employed goal functions leading to overestimation of the feature significance. To address this problem, this article introduces two new nonlinear feature selection methods, namely Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) and Normalised Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (NJMIM); both these methods use mutual information and the 'maximum of the minimum' criterion, which alleviates the problem of overestimation of the feature significance as demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The proposed methods are compared using eleven publically available datasets with five competing methods. The results demonstrate that the JMIM method outperforms the other methods on most tested public datasets, reducing the relative average classification error by almost 6% in comparison to the next best performing method. The statistical significance of the results is confirmed by the ANOVA test. Moreover, this method produces the best trade-off between accuracy and stability.},

abstract = {Creative consumers (defined as customers who adapt, modify, or transform a proprietary offering) represent an intriguing paradox for business. On one hand, they can signify a black hole for future revenue, with breach of copyright and intellectual property. On the other hand, they represent a gold mine of ideas and business opportunities. Central to business is the need to create and capture value, and creative consumers demand a shift in the mindsets and business models of how firms accomplish both. Based upon their attitude and action toward customer innovation, we develop a typology of firms' stances toward creative consumers. We then consider the implications of the stances model for corporate strategy and examine a three-step approach to dealing with creative consumers: awareness, analysis, and response. \textcopyright2006 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

abstract = {Although an abundance of academic literature positions organizational information processing as antecedent to decision making, little attention is paid to the possibility that decision making can be antecedent to certain elements of organizational information processing. Specifically, does the decision making process impact the type of organizational learning that takes place? Do different approaches to decision making alter the amount and variety of information made available to the organization, that is, the level of information overload? This paper examines incremental and comprehensive decision making to understand the effects of different decision making types on organizational learning and information overload. Incrementalism suggests that decision making should take place in small steps or increments. This approach analyzes only a few scenarios to make decisions resulting in few, if any, major organizational changes. However, comprehensive decision making requires the consideration of all possible scenarios and potential outcomes, resulting in a major overhaul of traditions and procedures within the organization. Consequently, each decision making approach has a different impact on organizational learning and information overload. \textcopyright2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present a new model for singing synthesis based on a modified version of the WaveNet architecture. Instead of modeling raw waveform, we model features produced by a parametric vocoder that separates the influence of pitch and timbre. This allows conveniently modifying pitch to match any target melody, facilitates training on more modest dataset sizes, and significantly reduces training and generation times. Our model makes frame-wise predictions using mixture density outputs rather than categorical outputs in order to reduce the required parameter count. As we found overfitting to be an issue with the relatively small datasets used in our experiments, we propose a method to regularize the model and make the autoregressive generation process more robust to prediction errors. Using a simple multi-stream architecture, harmonic, aperiodic and voiced/unvoiced components can all be predicted in a coherent manner. We compare our method to existing parametric statistical and state-of-the-art concatenative methods using quantitative metrics and a listening test. While naive implementations of the autoregressive generation algorithm tend to be inefficient, using a smart algorithm we can greatly speed up the process and obtain a system that's competitive in both speed and quality.},

It is based on a recurrent neural network to simultaneously detect the onsets and the pitches of the notes from spectral features. Long Short-Term Memory units are used in a bidirectional neural network to model the context of the notes. The use of a single regression output layer instead of the often used one-versus-all classification approach enables the system to significantly lower the number of erroneous note detections. Evaluation is based on common test sets and shows exceptional temporal precision combined with a significant boost in note transcription performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. The system is trained jointly with various synthesized piano instruments and real piano recordings and thus generalizes much better than existing systems. \textcopyright2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Sample and statistically based singing synthesizers typically require a large amount of data for automatically generating expressive synthetic performances. In this paper we present a singing synthesizer that using two rather small databases is able to generate expressive synthesis from an input consisting of notes and lyrics. The system is based on unit selection and uses the Wide-Band Harmonic Sinusoidal Model for transforming samples. The first database focuses on expression and consists of less than 2 minutes of free expressive singing using solely vowels. The second one is the timbre database which for the English case consists of roughly 35 minutes of monotonic singing of a set of sentences, one syllable per beat. The synthesis is divided in two steps. First, an expressive vowel singing performance of the target song is generated using the expression database. Next, this performance is used as input control of the synthesis using the timbre database and the target lyrics. A selection of synthetic performances have been submitted to the Interspeech Singing Synthesis Challenge 2016, in which they are compared to other competing systems.},

abstract = {In BCI (Brain - Computer Interface) systems, brain signals must be processed to identify distinct activities that convey different mental states. We propose a new technique for the classification of electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) activity for non-invasive BCI. The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Neural Network that includes a Fourier transform between hidden layers in order to switch from the time domain to the frequency domain analysis in the network. The first step allows the creation of different channels. The second step is dedicated to the transformation of the signal in the frequency domain. The last step is the classification. It uses a hybrid rejection strategy that uses a junk class for the mental transition states and thresholds for the confidence values. The presented results with offline processing are obtained with 6 electrodes on 2 subjects with a time segment of 1s. The system is reliable for both subjects over 95%, with rejection criterion. \textcopyright2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {The first attempt to generate musical sounds by solving the equations of vibrating strings by means of finite difference methods (FDM) was made by Hiller and Ruiz [J. Audio Eng. Soc. 19, 462–472 (1971)]. It is shown here how this numerical approach and the underlying physical model can be improved in order to simulate the motion of the piano string with a high degree of realism. Starting from the fundamental equations of a damped, stiff string interacting with a nonlinear hammer, a numerical finite difference scheme is derived, from which the time histories of string displacement and velocity for each point of the string are computed in the time domain. The interacting force between hammer and string, as well as the force acting on the bridge, are given by the same scheme. The performance of the model is illustrated by a few examples of simulated string waveforms. A brief discussion of the aspects of numerical stability and dispersion with reference to the proper choice of sampling parameters is also included. \textcopyright 1994, Acoustical Society of America.

abstract = {Different types of sentences express sentiment in very different ways. Traditional sentence-level sentiment classification research focuses on one-technique-fits-all solution or only centers on one special type of sentences. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which first classifies sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we find that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to first apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classification datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classification can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.},

abstract = {Neural Networks (NN) are important data mining tool used for classification and clustering. It is an attempt to build machine that will mimic brain activities and be able to learn. NN usually learns by examples. If NN is supplied with enough examples, it should be able to perform classification and even discover new trends or patterns in data. Basic NN is composed of three layers, input, output and hidden layer. Each layer can have number of nodes and nodes from input layer are connected to the nodes from hidden layer. Nodes from hidden layer are connected to the nodes from output layer. Those connections represent weights between nodes. This paper describes one of most popular NN algorithms, Back Propagation (BP) Algorithm. The aim is to show the logic behind this algorithm. Idea behind BP algorithm is quite simple, output of NN is evaluated against desired output. If results are not satisfactory, connection (weights) between layers are modified and process is repeated again and again until error is small enough. Simple BP example is demonstrated in this paper with NN architecture also covered. New implementation of BP algorithm are emerging and there are few parameters that could be changed to improve performance of BP.},

abstract = {A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks-their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits-but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes. \textcopyright2013 The Authors.},

We first study ways to control the capacity of Perceptrons (mainly regularization parameters and early stopping), using the margin idea introduced with SVMs. After showing that under simple conditions a Perceptron is equivalent to an SVM, we show it can be computationally expensive in time to train an SVM (and thus a Perceptron) with stochastic gradient descent, mainly because of the margin maximization term in the cost function. We then show that if we remove this margin maximization term, the learning rate or the use of early stopping can still control the margin. These ideas are extended afterward to the case of MLPs. Moreover, under some assumptions it also appears that MLPs are a kind of mixture of SVMs, maximizing the margin in the hidden layer space. Finally, we present a very simple MLP based on the previous findings, which yields better performances in generalization and speed than the other models.},

abstract = {Music genre recognition based on visual representation has been successfully explored over the last years. Classifiers trained with textural descriptors (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, and Gabor filters) extracted from the spectrograms have achieved state-of-the-art results on several music datasets. In this work, though, we argue that we can go further with the time-frequency analysis through the use of representation learning. To show that, we compare the results obtained with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the results obtained by using handcrafted features and SVM classifiers. In addition, we have performed experiments fusing the results obtained with learned features and handcrafted features to assess the complementarity between these representations for the music classification task. Experiments were conducted on three music databases with distinct characteristics, specifically a western music collection largely used in research benchmarks (ISMIR 2004 Database), a collection of Latin American music (LMD database), and a collection of field recordings of ethnic African music. Our experiments show that the CNN compares favorably to other classifiers in several scenarios, hence, it is a very interesting alternative for music genre recognition. Considering the African database, the CNN surpassed the handcrafted representations and also the state-of-the-art by a margin. In the case of the LMD database, the combination of CNN and Robust Local Binary Pattern achieved a recognition rate of 92%, which to the best of our knowledge, is the best result (using an artist filter) on this dataset so far. On the ISMIR 2004 dataset, although the CNN did not improve the state of the art, it performed better than the classifiers based individually on other kind of features.},

abstract = {We consider a stochastic variant of the NP-hard 0/1 knapsack problem, in which item values are deterministic and item sizes are independent random variables with known, arbitrary distributions. Items are placed in the knapsack sequentially, and the act of placing an item in the knapsack instantiates its size. Our goal is to compute a solution "policy" that maximizes the expected value of items successfully placed in the knapsack, where the final overflowing item, contributes no value. We consider both nonadaptive policies (that designate a priori a fixed sequence of items to insert) and adaptive policies (that can make dynamic choices based on the instantiated sizes of items placed in the knapsack thus far). An important facet of our work lies in characterizing the benefit of adaptivity. For this purpose we advocate the use of a measure called the adaptivity gap: the ratio of the expected value obtained by an optimal adaptive policy to that obtained by an optimal nonadaptive policy. We bound the adaptivity gap of the stochastic knapsack problem by demonstrating a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a nonadaptive policy whose expected value approximates that of an optimal adaptive policy to within a factor of four. We also devise a polynomial-time adaptive policy that approximates the optimal adaptive policy to within a factor of 3 + $\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon$ > 0. \textcopyright2008 INFORMS.},

abstract = {When planning a new development, location decisions have always been a major issue. This paper examines and compares two modelling methods used to inform a healthcare infrastructure location decision. Two Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) models were developed to support the optimisation of this decision-making process, within a National Health Service (NHS) organisation, in the UK. The proposed model structure is based on seven criteria (environment and safety, size, total cost, accessibility, design, risks and population profile) and 28 sub-criteria. First, Evidential Reasoning (ER) was used to solve the model, then, the processes and results were compared with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It was established that using ER or AHP led to the same solutions. However, the scores between the alternatives were significantly different; which impacted the stakeholders' decision-making. As the processes differ according to the model selected, ER or AHP, it is relevant to establish the practical and managerial implications for selecting one model or the other and providing evidence of which models best fit this specific environment. To achieve an optimum operational decision it is argued, in this study, that the most transparent and robust framework is achieved by merging ER process with the pair-wise comparison, an element of AHP. This paper makes a defined contribution by developing and examining the use of MCDA models, to rationalise new healthcare infrastructure location, with the proposed model to be used for future decision. Moreover, very few studies comparing different MCDA techniques were found, this study results enable practitioners to consider even further the modelling characteristics to ensure the development of a reliable framework, even if this means applying a hybrid approach.},

abstract = {Extreme learning machine (ELM), as a new learning framework, draws increasing attractions in the areas of large-scale computing, high-speed signal processing, artificial intelligence, and so on. ELM aims to break the barriers between the conventional artificial learning techniques and biological learning mechanism and represents a suite of machine learning techniques in which hidden neurons need not to be tuned. ELM theories and algorithms argue that "random hidden neurons" capture the essence of some brain learning mechanisms as well as the intuitive sense that the efficiency of brain learning need not rely on computing power of neurons. Thus, compared with traditional neural networks and support vector machine, ELM offers significant advantages such as fast learning speed, ease of implementation, and minimal human intervention. Due to its remarkable generalization performance and implementation efficiency, ELM has been applied in various applications. In this paper, we first provide an overview of newly derived ELM theories and approaches. On the other hand, with the ongoing development of multilayer feature representation, some new trends on ELM-based hierarchical learning are discussed. Moreover, we also present several interesting ELM applications to showcase the practical advances on this subject.},

abstract = {With the emergence of online social networks, the social network-based recommendation approach is popularly used. The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {How duplicate genes provide genetic robustness remains an unresolved question. We have examined the duplicated histone deacetylases Sir2p and Hst1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find that these paralogs with non-overlapping functions can provide genetic robustness against null mutations through a substitution mechanism. Hst1p is an NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase that acts with Sum1p to repress a subset of midsporulation genes. However, hst1Delta mutants show much weaker derepression of target loci than sum1Delta mutants. We show that this modest derepression of target loci in hst1Delta strains occurs in part because Sir2p substitutes for Hst1p. Sir2p contributes to repression of the midsporulation genes only in the absence of Hst1p and is recruited to target promoters by a physical interaction with the Sum1 complex. Furthermore, when Sir2p associates with the Sum1 complex, the complex continues to repress in a promoter-specific manner and does not spread. Our results imply that after the duplication, SIR2 and HST1 subfunctionalized. The single SIR2/HST1 gene from Kluyveromyces lactis, a closely related species that diverged prior to the duplication, can suppress an hst1Delta mutation in S. cerevisiae as well as interact with Sir4p in S. cerevisiae. In addition, the existence of two distinct protein interaction domains for the Sir and Sum1 complexes was revealed through the analysis of a chimeric Sir2-Hst1 molecule. Therefore, the ability of Sir2p to substitute for Hst1p probably results from a retained but reduced affinity for the Sum1 complex that is a consequence of subfunctionalization via the duplication, degeneration, and complementation mechanism. These results suggest that the evolutionary path of duplicate gene preservation may be an important indicator for the ability of duplicated genes to contribute to genetic robustness.},

Drawing on theories of technological diffusion, industrial evolution and long-term technological change this paper explores the effect of the development and diffusion of two future pervasive technologies on five industrial sectors in three regions during the 21st century in terms of their effect on economic structural change. Through semi-structured interviews with over 100 experts in the two technologies, the paper quantifies the effects of future biotechnologies and nanotechnologies on the industrial structure of the EU, USA and China in 2020 and 2050. The paper finds that as a result of the development and diffusion of future biotechnologies and nanotechnologies, some industries grow whilst others decline and some new ones emerge. The evidence suggests that the effect is different across countries and time; whereas the experts commonly believe that effect of the technologies on the industrial structure of the EU and US is likely to be similar, the effect in China is considered to be less by 2020 but the same as in the EU and US by 2050. This finding has important implications for the location of production, economic growth and energy demand in the future. \textcopyright2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Relatively small data sets available for expression recognition research make the training of deep networks very challenging. Although fine-tuning can partially alleviate the issue, the performance is still below acceptable levels as the deep features probably contain redundant information from the pretrained domain. In this paper, we present FaceNet2ExpNet, a novel idea to train an expression recognition network based on static images. We first propose a new distribution function to model the high-level neurons of the expression network. Based on this, a two-stage training algorithm is carefully designed. In the pre-training stage, we train the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In the refining stage, we append fully-connected layers to the pre-trained convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly. Visualization results show that the model trained with our method captures improved high-level expression semantics. Evaluations on four public expression databases, CK+, Oulu- CASIA, TFD, and SFEW demonstrate that our method achieves better results than state-of-the-art.},

The various applications are categorised into a novel two-dimensional taxonomy for image processing algorithms. One dimension specifies the type of task performed by the algorithm: preprocessing, data reduction/feature extraction, segmentation, object recognition, image understanding and optimisation. The other dimension captures the abstraction level of the input data processed by the algorithm: pixel-level, local feature-level, structure-level, object-level, object-set-level and scene characterisation. Each of the six types of tasks poses specific constraints to a neural-based approach. These specific conditions are discussed in detail. A synthesis is made of unresolved problems related to the application of pattern recognition techniques in image processing and specifically to the application of neural networks. Finally, we present an outlook into the future application of neural networks and relate them to novel developments. ?? 2002 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {In today's global business environment, where multinational companies are pressed to increase revenues in order to survive, creativity may hold the key to ensuring their new product development (NPD) efforts lead to innovations with worldwide appeal, such as Apple's iPad and Gillette's Fusion Razor. To leverage creativity for effective global NPD, businesses want to know how cultures differ in their concepts of creativity and the impact of those differences on approaches to developing new products. Because global new products are increasingly developed in, by, and for multiple cultures, a particular need is for a culturally reflective understanding, or conceptualization, of creativity. While creativity is believed to be culturally tied, the dominant framework of creativity used in business and management assumes that creativity is culturally indifferent or insensitive. This knowledge gap is addressed by studying the role of creativity in NPD practices in a cross-cultural or global context. The study begins by first developing a culturally anchored conceptualization of creativity. Called cross-cultural creativity, the concept draws on creativity insights from the field of art and aesthetics. The concept specifies two modes of creativity, neither of which is superior to the other, called the spontaneous or S route and the divergent or D route. The S route emphasizes adaptiveness, processes, intuitiveness, and metamorphism, while the D route focuses on disruptiveness, results, rationality, and literalism. Next, this new concept is applied to NPD by positing how creativity in distinct cultures may shape NPD practices, as illustrated by Japanese and U.S. firms. Research propositions are formulated to capture these patterns, and thereafter, theoretical and practical implications of the framework and propositions are discussed. The implications center on global NPD, which is a complex enterprise involving typically more than one culture to design and develop new products for several geographic markets. The study is of interest to researchers needing a globally situated, culturally attached framework of creativity for international NPD studies, and managers seeking to exploit creativity in multinational and multicultural innovation projects. \textcopyright2013 Product Development & Management Association.},

There are very few constraints on DMI design as such systems can be easily reconfigured, offering near limitless flexibility for music-making. Given that new acoustic musical instruments have in many cases been created in response to the limitations of available technologies, what motivates the development of new DMIs? We conducted an interview study with ten designers of new DMIs, in order to explore (a) the motivations electronic musicians may have for wanting to build their own instruments; and (b) the extent to which these motivations relate to the context in which the artist works and performs (academic vs club settings). We found that four categories of motivation were mentioned most often: M1 – wanting to bring greater embodiment to the activity of performing and producing electronic music; M2 – wanting to improve audience experiences of DMI performances; M3 – wanting to develop new sounds, and M4 – wanting to build responsive systems for improvisation. There were also some detectable trends in motivation according to the context in which the artists work and perform. Our results offer the first systematically gathered insights into the motivations for new DMI design. It appears that the challenges of controlling digital sound synthesis drive the development of new DMIs, rather than the shortcomings of any one particular design or existing technology.},

Solving this task using only audio as input is extremely challenging and does not provide an association of the separated speech signals with speakers in the video. In this paper, we present a deep network-based model that incorporates both visual and auditory signals to solve this task. The visual features are used to "focus" the audio on desired speakers in a scene and to improve the speech separation quality. To train our joint audio-visual model, we introduce AVSpeech, a new dataset comprised of thousands of hours of video segments from the Web. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to classic speech separation tasks, as well as real-world scenarios involving heated interviews, noisy bars, and screaming children, only requiring the user to specify the face of the person in the video whose speech they want to isolate. Our method shows clear advantage over stateof- the-art audio-only speech separation in cases of mixed speech. In addition, our model, which is speaker-independent (trained once, applicable to any speaker), produces better results than recent audio-visual speech separation methods that are speaker-dependent (require training a separate model for each speaker of interest).},

Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images - two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets - consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

abstract = {We present a new self-organizing neural network model that has two variants. The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches (e.g., the Kohonen feature map) is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process that also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method that results from the combination of the above-mentioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible-in contrast to earlier approaches-to perform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks that generalize very well. Results on the two-spirals benchmark and a vowel classification problem are presented that are better than any results previously published. \textcopyright1994.},

Furthermore, parameters are learned from data generated by the model, requiring no effort in the preparation and labeling of the training dataset.

Various MCDA methods have been developed over the years and applied to decision problems in many different areas. The outranking approach, and in particular the family of ELECTRE methods, continues to be a popular research field within MCDA, despite its more than 40 years of existence. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of English scholarly papers on ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods is performed. Our aim is to investigate how ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods have been considered in various areas. This includes area of applications, modifications to the methods, comparisons with other methods, and general studies of the ELECTRE methods. Although a significant amount of literature on ELECTRE is in a language different from English, we focus only on English articles, because many researchers may not be able to perform a study in some of the other languages. Each paper is categorized according to its main focus with respect to ELECTRE, i.e. if it considers an application, performs a review, considers ELECTRE with respect to the problem of selecting an MCDA method or considers some methodological aspects of ELECTRE. A total of 686 papers are included in the review. The group of papers considering an application of ELECTRE consists of 544 papers, and these are further categorized into 13 application areas and a number of sub-areas. In addition, all papers are classified according to the country of author affiliation, journal of publication, and year of publication. For the group of applied papers, the distribution by ELECTRE version vs. application area and ELECTRE version vs. year of publication are provided. We believe that this paper can be a valuable source of information for researchers and practitioners in the field of MCDA and ELECTRE in particular.},

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score. \textcopyright2013 IEEE.},

In order to capture the rich contextual structures in a query or a document, we start with each word within a temporal context window in a word sequence to directly capture contextual features at the word n-gram level. Next, the salient word n-gram features in the word sequence are discovered by the model and are then aggregated to form a sentence-level feature vector. Finally, a non-linear transformation is applied to extract high-level semantic information to generate a continuous vector representation for the full text string. The proposed convolutional latent semantic model (CLSM) is trained on clickthrough data and is evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a large-scale, real-world data set. Results show that the proposed model effectively captures salient semantic information in queries and documents for the task while significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art semantic models.},

It has been argued to be a crucial mechanism for open-ended cognitive development in humans, and as such has gathered a growing interest from developmental roboticists in the recent years. The goal of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a synthesis of the different approaches of intrinsic motivation in psychology. Second, by interpreting these approaches in a computational reinforcement learning framework, we argue that they are not operational and even sometimes inconsistent. Third, we set the ground for a systematic operational study of intrinsic motivation by presenting a formal typology of possible computational approaches. This typology is partly based on existing computational models, but also presents new ways of conceptualizing intrinsic motivation. We argue that this kind of computational typology might be useful for opening new avenues for research both in psychology and developmental robotics. \textcopyright2007 Oudeyer and Kaplan.},

abstract = {'Style transfer' among images has recently emerged as a very active research topic, fuelled by the power of convolution neural networks (CNNs), and has become fast a very popular technology in social media. This paper investigates the analogous problem in the audio domain: How to transfer the style of a reference audio signal to a target audio content? We propose a flexible framework for the task, which uses a sound texture model to extract statistics characterizing the reference audio style, followed by an optimization-based audio texture synthesis to modify the target content. In contrast to mainstream optimization-based visual transfer method, the proposed process is initialized by the target content instead of random noise and the optimized loss is only about texture, not structure. These differences proved key for audio style transfer in our experiments. In order to extract features of interest, we investigate different architectures, whether pre-trained on other tasks, as done in image style transfer, or engineered based on the human auditory system. Experimental results on different types of audio signal confirm the potential of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: 1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and 2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these traditional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on realworld benchmarking function approximation and classification problems including large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce best generalization performance in some cases and can learn much faster than traditional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.},

abstract = {Despite the development of a large number of refined multicriterion decision aid (MCDA) methods, none can be considered as the 'super method' appropriate to all decision making situations. Hence, how can one choose an appropriate method to a specific decision situation? Recent experimental studies in psychology and behaviour have revealed, on the one hand, that the human thinking is not to be modelled by logical rules and calculations, and, on the other hand, that the response mode affects the preference formation as well as the use of compensatory or noncompensatory strategies. The aim of this paper is to draw a conceptual framework for articulating tentative guidelines to choose an appropriate MCDA method. This paper also presents the results of the comparison of well known multicriterion aggregation procedures (MCAP) on the basis of these guidelines. In our opinion this study can constitute a first step for proposing a methodological approach to select an appropriate MCDA method to a specific decision making situation. Such an approach should be validated and may be integrated into a decision support system. Moreover, the framework suggested is helpful to develop useful methods and to address neglected issues within the field. \textcopyright1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Following recent advances in direct modeling of the speech waveform using a deep neural network, we propose a novel method that directly estimates a physical model of the vocal tract from the speech waveform, rather than magnetic resonance imaging data. This provides a clear relationship between the model and the size and shape of the vocal tract, offering considerable flexibility in terms of speech characteristics such as age and gender. Initial tests indicate that despite a highly simplified physical model, intelligible synthesized speech is obtained. This illustrates the potential of the combined technique for the control of physical models in general, and hence the generation of more natural-sounding synthetic speech.},

abstract = {This thesis addresses imitative digital sound synthesis of acoustically viable instruments with support of expressive, high-level control parameters. A general model is provided for quasi-harmonic instruments that reacts coherently with its acoustical equivalent when control parameters are varied. The approach builds upon recording-based methods and uses signal transformation techniques to manipulate instrument sound signals in a manner that resembles the behavior of their acoustical equivalents using the fundamental control parameters intensity and pitch. The method preserves the inherent quality of discretized recordings of a sound of acoustic instruments and introduces a transformation method that retains the coherency with its timbral variations when control parameters are modified. It is thus meant to introduce parametric control for sampling sound synthesis. The objective of this thesis is to introduce a new general model representing the timbre variations of quasi-harmonic music instruments regarding a parameter space determined by the control parameters pitch as well as global and instantaneous intensity. The model independently represents the deterministic and non-deterministic components of an instrument's signal and an extended source-filter model will be introduced for the former to represent the excitation and resonance characteristics of a music instrument by individual parametric filter functions. The latter component will be represented using a classic source-filter approach using filters with similar parameterization. All filter functions are represented using tensor-product B-splines to support for multivariate control variables. An algorithm will be presented for the estimation of the model's parameters that allows for the joint estimation of the filter functions of either component in a multivariate surface-fitting approach using a data-driven optimization strategy. This procedure also includes smoothness constraints and solutions for missing or sparse data and requires suitable data sets of single note recordings of a particular musical instrument. Another original contribution of the present thesis is an algorithm for the calibration of a note's intensity by means of an analysis of crescendo and decrescendo signals using the presented instrument model. The method enables the adjustment of the note intensity of an instrument sound coherent with the relative differences between varied values of its note intensity. A subjective evaluation procedure is presented to assess the quality of the transformations obtained using a calibrated instrument model and independently varied control parameters pitch and note intensity. Several extends of sound signal manipulations will be presented therein. For the support of inharmonic sounds as present in signals produced by the piano, a new algorithm for the joint estimation of a signal's fundamental frequency and inharmonicity coefficient is presented to extend the range of possible instruments to be manageable by the system. The synthesis system will be evaluated in various ways for sound signals of a trumpet, a clarinet, a violin and a piano.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {This paper describes the learning and control capabilities of a biologically constrained bottom-up model of the mammalian cerebellum. Results are presented from six tasks: 1) eyelid conditioning; 2) pendulum balancing; 3) proportional-integral-derivative control; 4) robot balancing; 5) pattern recognition; and 6) MNIST handwritten digit recognition. These tasks span several paradigms of machine learning, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, control, and pattern recognition. Results over these six domains indicate that the cerebellar simulation is capable of robustly identifying static input patterns even when randomized across the sensory apparatus. This capability allows the simulated cerebellum to perform several different supervised learning and control tasks. On the other hand, both reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition prove problematic due to the delayed nature of error signals and the simulator's inability to solve the credit assignment problem. These results are consistent with previous findings which hypothesize that in the human brain, the basal ganglia is responsible for reinforcement learning, while the cerebellum handles supervised learning.},

In particular, we consider the range-limited approximation of linking by intermediations in a few hops, and show the strong robustness in the growth without degrading efficiency of paths. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tolerance of connectivity is reformable even from extremely vulnerable real networks according to our proposed growing process with some investment.

Besides the baseline features, we extract from audio the functionals on low-level descriptors (LLDs) obtained via the YAAFE toolbox, and from video the Local Phase Quantization from Three Orthogonal Planes (LPQ-TOP) features. From the physiological signals, we extract 52 electro-cardiogram (ECG) features and 22 electro-dermal activity (EDA) features from various analysis domains. The extracted features along with the AV +EC 2015 baseline features of audio, ECG or EDA are concatenated for a further feature selection step, in which the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), instead of the usual Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), has been used as objective function. In addition, offsets between the features and the arousal/valence labels are considered in both feature selection and modeling of the affective dimensions. For the fusion of multimodal features, we propose a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM-RNN) based multimodal affect prediction framework, in which the initial predictions from the single modalities via the DBLSTM-RNNs are firstly smoothed with Gaussian smoothing, then input into a second layer of DBLSTMRNN for the final prediction of affective state. Experimental results show that our proposed features and the DBLSTMRNN based fusion framework obtain very promising results. On the development set, the obtained CCC is up to 0.824 for arousal and 0.688 for valence, and on the test set, the CCC is 0.747 for arousal and 0.609 for valence.},

Although this method has been available for about one century and is widely applied in various kinds of speech processing tasks (e.g. speech chimeras), there are only very few speech processing packages that contain readily available functions for the Hilbert transform, and there is very little textbook type literature tailored for speech scientists to explain the processes behind the transform. With this paper we provide the code for carrying out the Hilbert operation to obtain the TFS and ENV in the widely used speech processing software Praat, and explain the basics of the procedure. To verify our code, we compare the Hilbert transform in Praat with a widely applied function for the same purpose in MATLAB ("hilbert(.)"). We can confirm that both methods arrive at identical outputs.},

abstract = {Most current speech recognition systems use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to deal with the temporal variability of speech and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to determine how well each state of each HMM fits a frame or a short window of frames of coefficients that represents the acoustic input. An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition.},

abstract = {A capsule is a group of neurons whose outputs represent different properties of the same entity. Each layer in a capsule network contains many capsules. We describe a version of capsules in which each capsule has a logistic unit to represent the presence of an entity and a 4x4 matrix which could learn to represent the relationship between that entity and the viewer (the pose). A capsule in one layer votes for the pose matrix of many different capsules in the layer above by multiplying its own pose matrix by trainable viewpoint-invariant transformation matrices that could learn to represent part-whole relationships. Each of these votes is weighted by an assignment coefficient. These coefficients are iteratively updated for each image using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm such that the output of each capsule is routed to a capsule in the layer above that receives a cluster of similar votes. The transformation matrices are trained discriminatively by backpropagat-ing through the unrolled iterations of EM between each pair of adjacent capsule layers. On the smallNORB benchmark, capsules reduce the number of test errors by 45% compared to the state-of-the-art. Capsules also show far more resistance to white box adversarial attacks than our baseline convolutional neural network.},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

abstract = {Stereoscopic image quality assessment is an effective way to evaluate the performance of stereoscopic video systems, but how to utilize human visual characteristics effectively is still a research focus in stereoscopic image quality assessment. In this paper, a blind image quality assessment method for stereoscopic images is proposed via deep learning. The proposed method is composed of two stages: training and testing. In the training stage, Gabor filter is applied to the left and right distorted images respectively, and natural statistical features under different scales and directions are extracted to act as monocular features. Then, left and right images are fused to construct a cyclopean map, and histograms of oriented gradient features are extracted from the cyclopean map to act as binocular features. Finally, a regression model between features and subjective scores is established via deep belief network. In the testing stage, based on the established regression model, left and right image quality scores are predicted and fused to get the final stereoscopic image quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for both symmetrical and asymmetrical stereoscopic image databases, and can achieve high consistent alignment with subjective assessment.},

abstract = {We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of generalsum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (deﬁned by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the ﬁrst grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of ofﬂine learning performance in both games, we ﬁnd agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.},

abstract = {Abstract—The emergent machine learning technique - Ex- treme Learning Machines (ELMs) - has become a hot area of research over the past years, which is attributed to the growing research activities and significant contributions made by numerous researchers around the world. Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that i) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes / neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes / neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; ii) ELM is proposed for both generalized single hidden layer feedfoward network and multi hidden layers feedforward networks; iii) Homogeneous architecture based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary / multi- class) classification. iv) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi layers of networks either.},

abstract = {A sparse representation classifier (SRC) and a kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) are two successful methods for face recognition. An SRC is good at dealing with occlusion, while a KDA does well in suppressing intraclass variations. In this paper, we propose kernel extended dictionary (KED) for face recognition, which provides an efficient way for combining KDA and SRC. We first learn several kernel principal components of occlusion variations as an occlusion model, which can represent the possible occlusion variations efficiently. Then, the occlusion model is projected by KDA to get the KED, which can be computed via the same kernel trick as new testing samples. Finally, we use structured SRC for classification, which is fast as only a small number of atoms are appended to the basic dictionary, and the feature dimension is low. We also extend KED to multikernel space to fuse different types of features at kernel level. Experiments are done on several large-scale data sets, demonstrating that not only does KED get impressive results for nonoccluded samples, but it also handles the occlusion well without overfitting, even with a single gallery sample per subject.},

abstract = {Tougher competitive situations have led to increasing attention beingpaid to customer satisfaction, of which timely and customized servicesare the key concepts. As the product life cycle becomes shortened, highproduct quality becomes necessary for survival. Markets become highlydiversified and global, and continuous and unexpected change become thekey factors for success. The need for a method of rapidly andcost-effectively developing products, production facilities andsupporting software, including design, process planning and shop floorcontrol system has led to the concept of agile manufacturing.Agile manufacturing can be defined as the capability to survive andprosper in a competitive environment of continuous and unpredictablechange by reacting quickly and effectively to changing markets, drivenby customer-designed products and services. This article details the keyconcepts and enablers of agile manufacturing. The key enablers of agilemanufacturing include: (i) virtual enterprise formation tools/metrics;(ii) physically distributed manufacturing architecture and teams; (iii)rapid partnership formation tools/metrics; (iv) concurrent engineering;(v) integrated product/production/business information system; (vi)rapid prototyping tools; and (vii) electronic commerce. A conceptualframework for the development of an agile manufacturing system andfuture research directions are presented in this paper. This frameworktakes into account the customization and system integration with thehelp of business process redesign, legal issues, concurrent engineering,computer-integrated manufacturing, cost management, total qualitymanagement and information technology.},

abstract = {Feature recognition, from low level geometric entities of product designrepresentations within a CAD model to facilitate process planning andmanufacturing activities, has been of significant importance in computerintegrated manufacturing (CIM). However, the emerging paradigm of AgileManufacturing has imposed additional requirements of `'neutralformat'' so that form-feature information can be readily shared amongmultiple partners of a virtual enterprise. Recently, the STandard forthe Exchange of Product model data (STEP) has emerged as the means forneutral form exchange of product related data. The ``STEP efforts''have broken down the domain of manufacturing related activities in theform of application protocols (APs) target for specific functions whichinclude drafting, configuration control and feature-based processplanning to mention a few. Efforts are still on to increase theacceptance and use of this international standard (IS). This paperfocuses on our efforts to support the STEP standard with the developmentof a standards-oriented form-feature extraction system. The developedfeature extraction system takes as a input a STEP file defining thegeometry and topology of a part and generates as output a STEP file withform-feature information in AP224 format for form feature-based processplanning. The system can also be interfaced with a recent IGES to AP202translator [M.P. Bhandarkar, B. Downie, M. Hardwick, R. Nagi,Migration from ICES to STEP: one-to-one translation of IGES drawing toSTEP drafting data, accepted by Computers in Industry, July, 1999; M.P.Bhandarkar, Satisfying information needs in Agile Manufacturing throughtranslation and feature extraction into STEP product data models, MSThesis, State University of New York at Buffalo, 1997.] to allowconversion of legacy data. The feature recognition algorithm isboundary-representation (B-Rep) based and follows a sequential approachthrough an existing classification of features. Properties of eachfeature class are exploited to enable their extraction. The algorithm iscurrently developed for prismatic solids produced by milling operationsand that contain elementary shapes such as plane and cylindricalsurfaces (possibly using non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS)).Special attention has been paid to implementation issues. We demonstratethe efficacy of the system using representative parts. (C) 2000Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Thisarchitecture addresses the dynamic constraints on the vehicle's motion,and it provides at the same time a consistent decoupling betweenlow-level control and motion planning. The path planning algorithmretains the convergence properties of its kinematic counterparts. Systemsafety is also addressed in the face of finite computation times byanalyzing the behavior of the algorithm when the available onboardcomputation resources are limited, and the planning must be performed inreal time. The proposed algorithm can be applied to vehicles whosedynamics are described either by ordinary differential equations or byhigher-level, hybrid representations. Simulation examples involving aground robot and a small autonomous helicopter are presented anddiscussed.},

abstract = {Agile Manufacturing (AM) is a relatively new operations concept that isintended to improve the competitiveness of firms. Manufacturing/serviceprocesses based on AM are characterized by customer-supplier integratedprocesses for product design, manufacturing, marketing, and supportservices. Agile manufacturing requires enriching of the customer;cooperating with competitors; organizing to manage change, uncertaintyand complexity; and leveraging people and information. In recent years,a number of research papers have been published in the area of AM. Theterm `agile' was coined in 1991. However, there are still some seriousconcerns that prevent companies from taking an entirely differentdirection from AM. Considering the potential importance of agilemanufacturing in 21st century manufacturing competitiveness, an attempthas been made in this paper to re-examine the scope, definitions andstrategies of AM. In addition, a framework has been presented as a basisfor understanding the major strategies and relevant technologies of AM.},

abstract = {This article concerns the problem of managing the new generation ofAgile Earth Observing Satellites (AEOS). This kind of satellites ispresently studied by the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales(PLEIADES project). The mission of an Earth Observing Satellite is toacquire images of specified areas on the Earth surface, in response toobservation requests from customers. Whereas non-agile satellites suchas SPOT5 have only one degree of freedom for acquiring images, the newgeneration satellites have three, giving opportunities for a moreefficient use of the satellite imaging capabilities. Counterwise to thisadvantage, the selection and scheduling of observations becomessignificantly more difficult, due to the larger search space forpotential solutions. Hence, selecting and scheduling observations ofagile satellites is a highly combinatorial problem. This article setsout the overall problem and analyses its difficulties. Then it presentsdifferent methods which have been investigated in order to solve asimplified version of the complete problem: a greedy algorithm, adynamic programming algorithm, a constraint programming approach and alocal search method.

abstract = {In response to changing success factors and environmental pressures,companies are aspiring to break out of mass production and become leanor agile. Whereas performance enhancements of lean practices have beendemonstrated, it is now the case that markets have become increasinglycharacterized by turbulence, a situation in which reliance on leanpractices is insufficient, and that survival requires adoption of agilepractices. As a result, a comparative study of lean and agilemanufacturing with a related survey of current practices in the UK wascarried out, the results of which is presented in this paper. The paperexplored the threats to lean and the drivers of agile manufacturing.Using data from a questionnaire survey, four hypotheses were tested,which was indicative of the benefits of agile manufacturing. In contrastto their lean counterparts, agile companies paid attention to a widerrange of competitive capabilities. They therefore had a lower range ofmean scores on competitive capabilities. Independent sample tests ofsignificant difference in business performance measures revealed thatthe agile companies consistently outperformed their lean competitors onall business performance measures studied. In addition, a wider range ofcompetitive capabilities and performance measures of the agile companiescorrelated significantly and positively whilst such correlation wasobserved for only a narrow range of capabilities and performancemeasures for lean companies. The results suggest that competingsimultaneously on multiple competitive capabilities enhance performancebetter than a rather narrow focus on cost and quality.},

It is a light (100kg for the scientific instrument) satellite for the detection ofgamma-ray sources in the energy range 30 MeV-50 GeV within a large fieldof view (1 of the sky). It is planned to be operational in the years2003-2006, a period in which no other gamma-ray mission in the sameenergy range is foreseen.AGILE is made of a silicon tungsten tracker, a CsI(Tl) minicalorimeter(1.5X(0)), an anticoincidence system of segmented plastic scintillatorsand a X-ray imaging detector sensitive in the 10-40 keV range. Thetracker consists of 14 planes, each of them made of two layers of 16single-sided, AC coupled, 410 mum thick, 9.5 x 9.5 cm(2) silicondetectors with a readout pitch of 242 mum and a floating strip. Thereadout ASIC is the TAA1, an analog-digital, low noise, self-triggeringASIC used in a very low power configuration (<400 &mu;W/channel) withfull analog readout. The trigger of the satellite is given by thetracker.

Agile processes are less likely to be applicable insituations in which core assumptions do not hold. This article examinesthe principles and advocated practices of agile processes to identifyunderlying assumptions. It also identifies limitations that may arisefrom these assumptions and outlines how the limitations can be addressedby incorporating other software-development techniques and practicesinto agile development environments.},

abstract = {While there are many claims for the successful use of extremeprogramming (XP) and agile modeling (AM), and the proponents can oftenbe vocal in the extreme regarding their supposed benefits, researchevidence supporting proponents' claims is somewhat lacking. Currently,the only research appearing to investigate the phenomena consists of twoprominent streams. A small number of case studies and experience reportsthat generally promote the success of XP in various developmentenvironments, and a well-established stream of research into pairprogramming has generated results that in part support the idea of XPResearch into AM appears to be even more sparse than that for XP Casestudies, comparative analyses, and experience reports comprise themajority of the research in the area, while very few empirical researchefforts have been conducted. This article reviews the state of researchin XP and AM, and recommends areas that could benefit from furtherstudy. Since nearly all empirical XP research relates to pairprogramming, a closer look into the unstudied XP core practices would bebeneficial, although interaction between related core practice areascould confound such efforts. It might also be possible to group relatedcore XP concepts and study the groups individually. Finally, there arethose who claim that XP and AM, or even agility in general, are reallynothing more than a repackaging of old concepts. This claim needs to beinvestigated.},

High-level, localized RFI can beeasily identified by its unnatural appearance in brightness temperatureimagery. Low-level or persistent RFI can be much more difficult toidentify and filter out. The agile digital detector (ADD) candiscriminate between RFI and natural thermal emission signals bydirectly measuring higher order moments of the signal than the variancethat is traditionally measured. After detection, the ADD then usesspectral filtering methods to selectively remove the RFI. ADDperformance is experimentally verified in controlled laboratory testsand in the field near a commercial air traffic control radar. High-levelRFI is easily identified and removed. Very low level RFI contamination,with power levels as low as the radiometric measurement uncertainty ofthe radiometer, is also shown to be reliably detected and removed.},

abstract = {Tailoring of methods is commonplace in the vast majority of softwaredevelopment projects and organisations. However, there is not much knownabout the tailoring and engineering of agile methods, or about how thesemethods can be used to complement each other. This study investigatedtailoring of the agile methods, eXtreme programming (XP) and Scrum, atIntel Shannon, and involved experienced software engineers whocontinuously monitored and reflected on these methods over a 3- yearperiod. The study shows that agile methods may individually beincomplete in supporting the overall development process, but XP andScrum complement each other well, with XP providing support fortechnical aspects and Scrum providing support for project planning andtracking. The principles of XP and Scrum were carefully selected (onlysix of the 12 XP key practices were implemented, for example) andtailored to suit the needs of the development environment at IntelShannon. Thus, the study refutes the suggestion that agile methods arenot divisible or individually selectable but achieve their benefitsthrough the synergistic combination of individual agile practices;rather, this study shows that an a la carte selection and tailoring ofpractices can work very well. In the case of Scrum, some local tailoringhas led to a very committed usage by developers, in contrast to manydevelopment methods whose usage is limited despite being decreedmandatory by management. The agile practices that were applied did leadto significant benefits, including reductions in code defect density bya factor of 7. Projects of 6-month and 1-year duration have beendelivered ahead of schedule, which bodes well for future ability toaccurately plan development projects.},

The model helps tointegrate a variety of factors, tangible and intangible, strategic andoperational, for decision-making purposes.Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive development of factors isdetermined from the literature and an analytical network process (ANP)methodology is introduced for decision model development. Anillustrative example is presented.Findings - The results provide a robust model that will aid decisionmakers and agile virtual enterprise brokers form partnerships withinthese organizational structures.Research limitations/implications - The paper introduces a conceptualmodel with an illustrative validating example. A practical applicationand reapplication of the model are required to further validate themodel. ANP can require significant managerial input for its application,potentially causing fatigue for decision makers.Practical implications - Practical implications include a partnerselection tool and framework for decision makers. The model may beeasily tweaked by the elimination or addition of decision factors andtheir relationships.Originality/value - The paper is useful to practitioners andorganizations seeking to manage partnership formation of agile virtualenterprises, an emerging organizational form. This work expands thenumber of factors and interrelationships among these factors that noother model has explicitly addressed for the agile virtual enterpriseformation situation.},

abstract = {Purpose - Despite the fact that agile manufacturing has been frequentlypromoted as a means of improving business competitiveness, littleempirical evidence exists in the literature validating its positive linkwith business performance. The purpose of this research paper is toanalyse agile manufacturing in Spain and study whether it is a criticalfactor for success in different industries.Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model is drawn up, based onthe literature and a previous case study, to relate turbulence in theenvironment with agile manufacturing practices and business performance.The model is tested on a large sample of Spanish manufacturers using asurvey methodology to obtain information and a structural equation modelto analyse the data.Findings - The results obtained show that, in turbulent environments,the integrated use of agile manufacturing practices promotesmanufacturing competitive strength, leading to better operational,market and financial performance.Research limitations/implications - This study has two main limitations.First, it is difficult to determine the most suitable unit of analysiswhen studying agile manufacturing. Second, single respondent bias may beconsidered a limitation.Practical implications - Managers should consider the integratedimplementation of agile manufacturing practices in order to developmanufacturing strength and to outperform competitors in turbulentbusiness environments.Originality/value - This study adopts a systematic approach to theanalysis of agile manufacturing, considering various agility practicesor enablers in an integrated way and relating them not only toenvironmental characteristics but also to business performance. Thisapproach is especially interesting because most of the literature onagile manufacturing deals with agility strategies or techniques in anisolated way. The study also tests the suitability of agilemanufacturing in real organisations - for the first time in the Spanishcontext.},

abstract = {Aims. Since the CGRO operation in 1991-2000, one of the primaryunresolved questions about the blazar gamma-ray emission has been itspossible correlation with the low-energy (in particular optical)emission. To help answer this problem, the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope(WEBT) consortium has organized the GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP)to provide the optical-to-radio monitoring data to be compared with thegamma-ray detections by the AGILE and GLAST satellites. This new WEBTproject started in early September 2007, just before a strong gamma-raydetection of 0716+714 by AGILE.Methods. We present the GASP-WEBT optical and radio light curves of thisblazar obtained in July-November 2007, about various AGILE pointings atthe source. We construct NIR-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs),by assembling GASP-WEBT data together with UV data from the Swift ToOobservations of late October.Results. We observe a contemporaneous optical-radio outburst, which is arare and interesting phenomenon in blazars. The shape of the SEDs duringthe outburst appears peculiarly wavy because of an optical excess and aUV drop- and-rise. The optical light curve is well sampled during theAGILE pointings, showing prominent and sharp flares. A futurecross-correlation analysis of the optical and AGILE data will shed lighton the expected relationship between these flares and the gamma-rayevents.},

abstract = {Background: Capsule endoscopy (CE) of the small bowel has become astandard diagnostic tool, but there have been concerns regarding therisk of capsule retention in certain high-risk groups. The Agile patencysystem, an ingestible and dissolvable capsule with an external scanner,was developed to allow physicians to perform CE with greater confidencethat the capsule will be safely excreted in patients at risk for capsuleretention.Objective: Our purpose was to assess the ability of the device to helpphysicians identify which patients with known strictures may safelyundergo CE.Design: Patients with known strictures ingested the new patency capsuleand under-went periodic scanning until it was excreted. The intestinaltract was considered to be sufficiently patent if the capsule wasexcreted intact or if the capsule was not detected by the scanner at 30hours after ingestion. if patency was established, then standard CE wasperformed.Setting: International multicenter study.Patients: A total of 106 patients with known strictures.Intervention: Agile patency system.Main Outcome Measurements: Performance and safety of Agile patencysystem.Results: A total of 106 patients ingested the patency capsule.Fifty-nine (56%) excreted it intact and subsequently underwent CE.There were no cases of capsule retention. Significant findings on CEwere found in 24 (41%). There were 3 severe adverse events.Conclusions: These results suggest that the Agile patency system is auseful tool for physicians to use before CE in patients with stricturesto avoid retention. This group of patients may have a high yield ofclinically significant findings at CE. This capsule may determinewhether patients who have a contraindication to CE may safely undergo CEand obtain useful diagnostic information.},

abstract = {Metamaterials exhibit numerous novel effects(1-5) and operate over alarge portion of the electromagnetic spectrum(6-10). Metamaterialdevices based on these effects include gradient-index lenses(11,12),modulators for terahertz radiation(13-15) and compact waveguides(16).The resonant nature of metamaterials results in frequency dispersion andnarrow bandwidth operation where the centre frequency is fixed by thegeometry and dimensions of the elements comprising the metamaterialcomposite. The creation of frequency-agile metamaterials would extendthe spectral range over which devices function and, further, enable themanufacture of new devices such as dynamically tunable notch filters.Here, we demonstrate such frequency-agile metamaterials operating in thefar-infrared by incorporating semiconductors in critical regions ofmetallic split-ring resonators. For this first-generation device,external optical control results in tuning of the metamaterial resonancefrequency by similar to 20%. Our approach is integrable with currentsemiconductor technologies and can be implemented in other regions ofthe electromagnetic spectrum.},

abstract = {While software is so important for all facets of the modern world,software development itself is not a perfect process. Agile softwareengineering methods have recently emerged as a new and different way ofdeveloping software as compared to the traditional methodologies.However, their success has mostly been anecdotal, and research in thissubject is still scant in the academic circles. This research study wasa survey study on the critical success factors of Agile softwaredevelopment projects using quantitative approach.Based on existing literature, a preliminary list of potential criticalsuccess factors of Agile projects were identified and compiled.Subsequently, reliability analysis and factor analysis were conducted toconsolidate this preliminary list into a final set of 12 possiblecritical success factors for each of the four project success categories- Quality, Scope, Time, and Cost.A survey was conducted among Agile professionals, gathering survey datafrom 109 Agile projects from 25 countries across the world. Multipleregression techniques were used, both at the full regression model andat the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure.The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported,identifying three critical success factors for Agile softwaredevelopment projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile SoftwareEngineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability.Limitations of the study are discussed together with interpretations forpractitioners. To ensure success of their projects, managers are urgedto focus on choosing a high-caliber team, practicing Agile engineeringtechniques and following Agile-style delivery strategy.

abstract = {Wireless networks and devices have rapidly been gaining popularity overtheir wired counterparts. This popularity, in turn, has been generatingan explosive and ever-increasing demand for, and hence creating ashortage of, the radio spectrum. The reason for this foreseen spectrumshortage is reported not to be the scarcity of the radio spectrum butthe inefficiency of current spectrum access methods, thus leavingspectrum opportunities along both the time and frequency dimensions thatwireless devices can exploit. Fortunately, recent technological advanceshave made it possible to build software-defined radios (SDRs), which,unlike traditional radios, can switch from one frequency band to anotherat little or no cost. We propose a MAC protocol, called OpportunisticSpectrum MAC (OS-MAC), for wireless networks equipped with cognitiveradios like SDRs. OS-MAC 1) adaptively and dynamically seeks andexploits opportunities in both licensed and unlicensed spectra and alongboth the time and frequency dimensions, 2) accesses and shares spectrumamong different unlicensed and licensed users, and 3) coordinates withother unlicensed users for better spectrum utilization. Using extensivesimulation, OS-MAC is shown to be far more effective than current accessprotocols from both the network's and the user's perspectives. Bycomparing its performance with an Ideal-MAC protocol, OS-MAC is alsoshown to not only outperform current access protocols, but also achieveperformance very close to that obtainable under the Ideal-MAC protocol.},

In spite of the encouragingresults so far, little is known about how agile practices affectcommunication. This article presents the results from a study whichexamined the impact of XP and SCRUM practices on communication withinsoftware development teams and within the focal organization. Theresearch was carried out as a case study in F-Secure where two agilesoftware development projects were compared from the communicationperspective. The goal of the study is to increase the understanding ofcommunication in the context of agile software development: internallyamong the developers and project leaders and in the interface betweenthe development team and stakeholders (i.e. customers, testers, otherdevelopment teams). The study shows that agile practices improve bothinformal and formal communication. However, it further indicates that,in larger development situations involving multiple externalstakeholders, a mismatch of adequate communication mechanisms cansometimes even hinder the communication. The study highlights the factthat hurdles and improvements in the communication process can bothaffect the feature requirements and task subtask dependencies asdescribed in coordination theory. While the use of SCRUM and some XPpractices facilitate team and organizational communication of thedependencies between product features and working tasks, the use ofagile practices requires that the team and organization use alsoadditional plan-driven practices to ensure the efficiency of externalcommunication between all the actors of software development.},

AGILE was successfully launched on 2007 April 23from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorialorbit with very low particle background.Aims. AGILE provides crucial data for the study of active galacticnuclei, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, unidentified gamma-ray sources,galactic compact objects, supernova remnants, TeV sources, andfundamental physics by microsecond timing.Methods. An optimal sky angular positioning (reaching 0.1 degrees ingamma- rays and 1-2 arcmin in hard X-rays) and very large fields of view(2.5 sr and 1 sr, respectively) are obtained by the use of Silicondetectors integrated in a very compact instrument.Results. AGILE surveyed the gamma- ray sky and detected many Galacticand extragalactic sources during the first months of observations.Particular emphasis is given to multifrequency observation programs ofextragalactic and galactic objects.Conclusions.

abstract = {Despite the popularity of agile methods in software development andincreasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agilityis and how it is achieved. The debate suffers from a lack ofunderstanding of agile concepts and how agile software development ispracticed. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agilesoftware development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agilityand the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded incomplex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles ofcoevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximizeself-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. Theseprinciples are used to study the processes of two software developmentteams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a teamusing a more traditional, waterfall-based development cycle. From thecases a framework for the organization of agile software development isdeveloped. Time pacing, self-management with discipline androutinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in thecases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack ofresources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors toagility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identified fromthe research include coevolution of business value, sustainable workingwith rhythm, sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness.},

abstract = {In this paper, we draw on control theory to understand the conditionsunder which the use of agile practices is most effective in improvingsoftware project quality. Although agile development methodologies offerthe potential of improving software development outcomes, limitedresearch has examined how project managers can structure the softwaredevelopment environment to maximize the benefits of agile methodologyuse during a project. As a result, project managers have little guidanceon how to manage teams who are using agile methodologies. Arguing thatthe most effective control modes are those that provide teams withautonomy in determining the methods for achieving project objectives, wepropose hypotheses related to the interaction between control modes,agile methodology use, and requirements change. We test the model in afield study of 862 software developers in 110 teams. The model explainssubstantial variance in four objective measures of project quality-bugseverity, component complexity, coordinative complexity, and dynamiccomplexity. Results largely support our hypotheses, highlighting theinterplay between project control, agile methodology use, andrequirements change. The findings contribute to extant literature byintegrating control theory into the growing literature on agilemethodology use and by identifying specific contingencies affecting theefficacy of different control modes. We discuss the theoretical andpractical implications of our results.},

abstract = {Purpose - Lean and agile manufacturing are two initiatives that are usedby manufacturing plant managers to improve operations capabilities. Thepurpose of this paper is to investigate internal and external factorsthat drive the choice of lean and agile operations capabilities andtheir respective impact on operational performance.Design/methodology/approach - Lean and agile manufacturing are eachconceptualized as a second-order factor and measured through a bundle ofdistinct practices. The competitive intensity of industry and thecompetitive strategy are modeled as potential external and internaldrivers, respectively, and the impact on quality, delivery, cost, andflexibility performance is analyzed using structural equations modeling.The model is tested with data from the high performance manufacturingproject comprising a total of 211 plants from three industries and sevencountries.Findings - The results indicate that lean and agile manufacturing differin terms of drivers and outcomes. The choice of a cost-leadershipstrategy fully mediates the impact of the competitive intensity ofindustry as a driver of lean manufacturing, while agile manufacturing isdirectly affected by both internal and external drivers, i.e. adifferentiation strategy as well as the competitive intensity ofindustry. Agile manufacturing is found to be negatively associated witha cost-leadership strategy, emphasizing the difference between lean andagile manufacturing. The major differences in performance outcomes arerelated to cost and flexibility, such that lean manufacturing has asignificant impact on cost performance (whereas agile manufacturing hasnot), and that agile manufacturing has a stronger relationship withvolume as well as product mix flexibility than does lean manufacturing.Research limitations/implications - Cross-sectional data from threeindustries and seven countries are used, and it would be interesting totest this model for more industries and countries.Practical implications - The results provide insights into the factorsthat influence the choice of lean or agile manufacturing for improvingoperations, and the results that can be obtained.Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the firstlarge-scale empirical survey of leanness and agility simultaneously,using data from manufacturing firms in Europe, Asia, and North America.The model incorporates a wide perspective on factors related to lean andagile manufacturing, to be able to identify similarities anddifferences.},

abstract = {This paper considers a supply chain design problem for a new marketopportunity with uncertain demand in an agile manufacturing setting. Weconsider the integrated optimization of logistics and production costsassociated with the supply chain members. These problems routinely occurin a wide variety of industries including semiconductor manufacturing,multi-tier automotive supply chains, and consumer appliances to name afew. There are two types of decision variables: binary variables forselection of companies to form the supply chain and continuous variablesassociated with production planning. A scenario approach is used tohandle the uncertainty of demand. The formulation is a robustoptimization model with three components in the objective function:expected total costs, cost variability due to demand uncertainty, andexpected penalty for demand unmet at the end of the planning horizon.The increase of computational time with the numbers of echelons andmembers per echelon necessitates a heuristic. A heuristic based on ak-shortest path algorithm is developed by using a surrogate distance todenote the effectiveness of each member in the supply chain. Theheuristic can find an optimal solution very quickly in some small- andmedium-size cases. For large problems, a ``good'' solution with asmall gap relative to our lower bound is obtained in a shortcomputational time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As business and technology environments change at an unprecedented rate,software development agility to respond to changing user requirementshas become increasingly critical for software development performance.Agile software development approaches, which emphasizesense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, andcontinuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number oforganizations to improve their software development agility. However,the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive,lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support theprinciples and practices of agile development. Little research hasempirically examined the software development agility construct in termsof its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software developmentperformance. As a result, there is a lack of understanding about howorganizations can effectively implement an agile development approach.Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative andqualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agiledevelopment by empirically examining the relationships among twodimensions of software development agility (software team responseextensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedentsthat can be con trolled (team autonomy and team diversity), and threeaspects of software development performance (on-time completion,on-budget completion, and software functionality). Our PLS results ofsurvey, responses of 399 software project managers suggest that therelationships among these variables are more complex than what has beenperceived by the literature. The results suggest a tradeoff relationshipbetween response extensiveness and response efficiency. These twoagility dimensions impact software development performance differently:response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion,on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas responseextensiveness positively affects only software functionality. Theresults also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect onresponse efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, andthat team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness, Weconducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate ourPLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex,dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, andperformance. The qualitative analysis also provides explanations forboth supported and unsupported hypotheses. We discuss these qualitativeanalysis results and conclude with the theoretical and practicalimplications of our research findings for agile development approaches.},

abstract = {Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) provides a mechanismfor capturing a 3D spectral cube with a single shot 2D measurement. Inmany applications selective spectral imaging is sought since relevantinformation often lies within a subset of spectral bands. Capturing andreconstructing all the spectral bands in the observed image cube, tothen throw away a large portion of this data, is inefficient. To thisend, this paper extends the concept of CASSI to a system admittingmultiple shot measurements, which leads not only to higher quality ofreconstruction but also to spectrally selective imaging when thesequence of code aperture patterns is optimized. The aperture codeoptimization problem is shown to be analogous to the optimization of aconstrained multichannel filter bank. The optimal code apertures allowthe decomposition of the CASSI measurement into several subsets, eachhaving information from only a few selected spectral bands. The richtheory of compressive sensing is used to effectively reconstruct thespectral bands of interest from the measurements. A number ofsimulations are developed to illustrate the spectral imagingcharacteristics attained by optimal aperture codes. (C) 2011 OpticalSociety of America},

abstract = {To enhance the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the adverse effects oftraditional Chinese medicine, practitioners often prescribe combinationsof plant species and/or minerals, called formulae. Unfortunately, theworking mechanisms of most of these compounds are difficult to determineand thus remain unknown. In an attempt to address the benefits offormulae based on current biomedical approaches, we analyzed thecomponents of Yinchenhao Tang, a classical formula that has been shownto be clinically effective for treating hepatic injury syndrome. Thethree principal components of Yinchenhao Tang are Artemisia annua L.,Gardenia jasminoids Ellis, and Rheum Palmatum L., whose major activeingredients are 6,7-dimethylesculetin (D), geniposide (G), and rhein(R), respectively. To determine the mechanisms underlying the efficacyof this formula, we conducted a systematic analysis of the therapeuticeffects of the DGR compound using immunohistochemistry, biochemistry,metabolomics, and proteomics. Here, we report that the DGR combinationexerts a more robust therapeutic effect than any one or two of the threeindividual compounds by hitting multiple targets in a rat model ofhepatic injury. Thus, DGR synergistically causes intensified dynamicchanges in metabolic biomarkers, regulates molecular networks throughtarget proteins, has a synergistic/additive effect, and activates bothintrinsic and extrinsic pathways.},

Here, we propose a new approach to near-infrared molecularspectroscopy, utilizing advanced concepts of optical telecommunicationsand supercontinuum photonics. We generate, without mode-locked lasers,two frequency combs of slightly different repetition frequencies andmoderate, but rapidly tunable, spectral span. The output of afrequency-agile continuous-wave laser is split and sent into twoelectro-optic intensity modulators. Flat-top low-noise frequency combsare produced by wave-breaking in a nonlinear optical fibre of normaldispersion. With a dual-comb spectrometer, we record Doppler-limitedspectra spanning 60 GHz within 13 mu s and an 80 kHz refresh rate, at atuning speed of 10 nm s(-1). The sensitivity for weak absorption isenhanced by a long gas-filled hollow-core fibre. New opportunities forreal-time diagnostics may be opened up, even outside the laboratory.},

Based on Convolutional Neural Networks, our deep network features a fusion layer that allows us to elegantly merge local information dependent on small image patches with global priors computed using the entire image. The entire framework, including the global and local priors as well as the colorization model, is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene classification database to train our model, exploiting the class labels of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the global priors. We validate our approach with a user study and compare against the state of the art, where we show significant improvements. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method extensively on many different types of images, including black-and-white photography from over a hundred years ago, and show realistic colorizations.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Moreover, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, hundreds of twitter users have posted their own artistic experiments using our system. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

abstract = {Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagaling error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropa-gated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which arc decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass - amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

While several topic specific survey papers have been written, to date no general survey on problems, datasets and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles exists. This paper attempts to narrow this gap by providing a state-of-the-art survey on this topic. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state-of-the-art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding and end-to-end learning. Towards this goal, we first provide a taxonomy to classify each approach and then analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarking datasets including KITTI, ISPRS, MOT and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we will also provide an interactive platform which allows to navigate topics and methods, and provides additional information and project links for each paper.},

In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current progress towards NST. We first propose a taxonomy of current algorithms in the field of NST.

First, we modify the recurrent architecture to improve spatial diffusion, which allows the network to more effectively capture and propagate image information through the network's hidden state. Second, in addition to lossless entropy coding, we use a spatially adaptive bit allocation algorithm to more efficiently use the limited number of bits to encode visually complex image regions. Finally, we show that training with a pixel-wise loss weighted by SSIM increases reconstruction quality according to multiple metrics. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and Tecnick image sets and compare against standard codecs as well as recently published methods based on deep neural networks.},

abstract = {We present a novel neural network for processing sequences. The ByteNet is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive field. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We find that the latent alignment structure contained in the representations reflects the expected alignment between the tokens.},

abstract = {A wealth of algorithms centered around (integer) linear programming have been proposed to compute equilibrium strategies in security games with discrete states and actions. However, in practice many domains possess continuous state and action spaces. In this paper, we consider a continuous space security game model with infinite-size action sets for players and present a novel deep learning based approach to extend the existing toolkit for solving security games. Specifically, we present (i) OptGradFP, a novel and general algorithm that searches for the optimal defender strategy in a parameterized continuous search space, and can also be used to learn policies over multiple game states simultaneously; (ii) OptGradFP-NN, a convolutional neural network based implementation of OptGradFP for continuous space security games. We demonstrate the potential to predict good defender strategies via experiments and analysis of OptGradFP and OptGradFP-NN on discrete and continuous game settings.},

To achieve rich, natural sounds, all of them require fast arithmetic capability, such as is found on expensive computers or digital synthesizers. For musicians and experimenters without access to these machines, musically interesting digital synthesis has been almost impossible. The techniques described in this paper can be implemented quite cheaply on almost any computer. Real-time synthesis implementations have been done for Intel 8080A (by Alex Strong), Texas Instruments TMS9900 (by Kevin Karplus), and SC/MP (by Mike Plass) microprocessors. David Jaffe and Julius Smith have programmed the Systems Concept Digital Synthesizer at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) to perform several variants of the algorithms (Jaffe and Smith 1983).},

abstract = {This paper considers dynamic string motion in which the displacement is unilaterally constrained by the termination condition with an arbitrarily chosen geometry. A digital waveguide model is proposed for simulating the nonlin- earity inducing interactions between the vibrating string and the contact condition at the point of string termina- tion. The current work analyzes the resulting string mo- tion influenced by the contact conditions with mostly flat but slightly curved geometries. The effect of a minute im- perfection of the termination condition on the string vibra- tion is investigated. It is shown that the lossless string vi- brates in two distinct vibration regimes. In the beginning the string starts to interact in a nonlinear fashion with the bridge, and the resulting string motion is nonperiodic. The duration of that vibration regime depends on the geome- try of the bridge. After some time of nonperiodic vibra- tion, the string vibration settles in a periodic regime. Pre- sented results are applicable for example in the physics- based sound synthesis of stringed musical instruments, such as the shamisen, biwa, sitar, tambura, veena or even the bray harp and the grand piano.},

However, problems using this methodology in the context of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) have been noted resulting in the proposal of supervised and constrained variants of NMF for this purpose. Group sparsity has previously been seen to be effective for AMT when used with stepwise methods. In this paper group sparsity is introduced to supervised NMF decompositions and a dictionary tuning approach to AMT is proposed based upon group sparse NMF using the $\beta$-divergence. Experimental results are given showing improved AMT results over the state-of-the-art NMF-based AMT system. \textcopyright2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {This lively and accessible book describes the theory and applications of Hilbert spaces and also presents the history of the subject to reveal the ideas behind theorems and the human struggle that led to them. The authors begin by establishing the concept of 'countably infinite', which is central to the proper understanding of separable Hilbert spaces. Fundamental ideas such as convergence, completeness and dense sets are first demonstrated through simple familiar examples and then formalised. Having addressed fundamental topics in Hilbert spaces, the authors then go on to cover the theory of bounded, compact and integral operators at an advanced but accessible level. Finally, the theory is put into action, considering signal processing on the unit sphere, as well as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The text is interspersed with historical comments about central figures in the development of the theory, which helps bring the subject to life.},

abstract = {We consider the task of dimensional emotion recognition on video data using deep learning. While several previous methods have shown the benefits of training temporal neural network models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on hand-crafted features, few works have considered combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with RNNs. In this work, we present a system that performs emotion recognition on video data using both CNNs and RNNs, and we also analyze how much each neural network component contributes to the system's overall performance. We present our findings on videos from the Audio/Visual+Emotion Challenge (AV+EC2015). In our experiments, we analyze the effects of several hyperparameters on overall performance while also achieving superior performance to the baseline and other competing methods.},

abstract = {We have used integral field spectroscopy of a sample of six nearby (z $\sim$ 0.01–0.04) high star-formation rate (SFR ∼ 10–40 M yr−1) galaxies to investigate the relationship between local velocity dispersion and star-formation rate on sub-galactic scales. The low-redshift mitigates, to some extent, the effect of beam smearing which artificially inflates the measured dispersion as it combines regions with different line-of-sight velocities into a single spatial pixel. We compare the parametric maps of the velocity dispersion with the H$\alpha$ flux (a proxy for local star-formation rate), and the velocity gradient (a proxy for the local effect of beam smearing). We find, even for these very nearby galaxies, the H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion correlates more strongly with velocity gradient than with H$\alpha$ flux—implying that beam smearing is still having a significant effect on the velocity dispersion measurements. We obtain a first-order non parametric correction for the unweighted and flux weighted mean velocity dispersion by fitting a 2D linear regression model to the spaxel-by-spaxel data where the velocity gradient and the H$\alpha$ flux are the independent variables and the velocity dispersion is the dependent variable; and then extrapolating to zero velocity gradient. The corrected velocity dispersions are a factor of $\sim$1.3–4.5 and $\sim$1.3–2.7 lower than the uncorrected flux-weighted and unweighted mean line-of-sight velocity dispersion values, respectively. These corrections are larger than has been previously cited using disc models of the velocity and velocity dispersion field to correct for beam smearing. The corrected flux-weighted velocity dispersion values are $\sigma$m ∼ 20–50 km s−1.},

abstract = {This article is concerned with the ways virtual instrument software simulates acoustic human performance. In particular, it examines two case studies-virtual orchestral instruments and virtual singing instruments-to consider how their design and implementation seek to express human music performance by adopting the micro and macro sonic variations of timing, pitch, dynamics, articulation, ambience, and other limitations imposed by the physical relationship between the player and the instrument. Baudrillard considers that "simulation threatens the difference between the 'true' and the 'false', the 'real' and the 'imaginary'" (1994: 3). By feigning the acoustic markers of expressive human musical performance, virtual instrument designers and composer-users encourage the listener to produce, in themselves, the experience of hearing an orchestra or singer. Users also contribute to the recontextualization of human performance by feeding back into the cultures and development cycles of virtual instrument software, where sonic gestures are recurrently refreshed. The construction of virtual instruments as devices of musical expressivity is, therefore, an evolving, mutually constructed, and performative endeavour.},

The design of the Gaussian filter bears relationship with the noise statistics and also some basic information about the signal.

abstract = {We have studied the structural behavior of bismuth phosphate under compression. We performed x-ray powder diffraction measurements up to 31.5 GPa and ab initio calculations. Experiments were carried out on different polymorphs: trigonal (phase I) and monoclinic (phases II and III). Phases I and III, at low pressure (P < 0.2-0.8 GPa), transform into phase II, which has a monazite-type structure. At room temperature, this polymorph is stable up to 31.5 GPa. Calculations support these findings and predict the occurrence of an additional transition from the monoclinic monazite-type to a tetragonal scheelite-type structure (phase IV). This transition was experimentally found after the simultaneous application of pressure (28 GPa) and temperature (1500 K), suggesting that at room temperature the transition might by hindered by kinetic barriers. Calculations also predict an additional phase transition at 52 GPa, which exceeds the maximum pressure achieved in the experiments. This transition is from phase IV to an orthorhombic barite-type structure (phase V). We also studied the axial and bulk compressibility of BiPO4. Room-temperature pressure-volume equations of state are reported. BiPO4 was found to be more compressible than isomorphic rare-earth phosphates. The discovered phase IV was determined to be the less compressible polymorph of BiPO4. On the other hand, the theoretically predicted phase V has a bulk modulus comparable with that of monazite-type BiPO4. Finally, the isothermal compressibility tensor for the monazite-type structure is reported at 2.4 GPa showing that the direction of maximum compressibility is in the (0 1 0) plane at approximately 15° (21°) to the a axis for the case of our experimental (theoretical) study.},

abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction. \textcopyright1990.},

abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient-based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN's), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day. \textcopyright1998 IEEE.},

abstract = {We develop a technique using deep neural network for human facial expression recognition. Images of human faces are preprocessed with photometric normalization and histogram manipulation to remove illumination variance. Facial features are then extracted by convolving each preprocessed image with 40 Gabor filters. Kernel PCA is applied to features before feeding them into the deep neural network that consists of 1 input layer, 2 hidden layers and a softmax classifier. The deep network is trained using greedy layer-wise strategy. We use the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset for training and testing. Recognition tests are performed on six basic expressions (i.e. surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, sadness). To test the robustness of the classification system further, and for benchmark comparison, we add a seventh emotion, namely 'contempt', for additional recognition tests. We construct confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the deep network. It is demonstrated that the network generalizes to new images fairly successfully with an average recognition rate of 96.8% for six emotions and 91.7% for seven emotions. In comparison with shallower neural networks and SVM methods, the proposed deep network method can provide better recognition performance.},

abstract = {Gradient backpropagation (BP) requires symmetric feedforward and feedback connections-the same weights must be used for forward and backward passes. This "weight transport problem" (Grossberg 1987) is thought to be one of the main reasons to doubt BP's biologically plausibility. Using 15 different classification datasets, we systematically investigate to what extent BP really depends on weight symmetry. In a study that turned out to be surprisingly similar in spirit to Lillicrap et al.'s demonstration (Lillicrap et al. 2014) but orthogonal in its results, our experiments indicate that: (1) the magnitudes of feedback weights do not matter to performance (2) the signs of feedback weights do matter-the more concordant signs between feedforward and their corresponding feedback connections, the better (3) with feedback weights having random magnitudes and 100% concordant signs, we were able to achieve the same or even better performance than SGD. (4) some normalizations/stabilizations are indispensable for such asymmetric BP to work, namely Batch Normalization (BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) and/or a "Batch Manhattan" (BM) update rule.},

abstract = {Deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations are currently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets. The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activation functions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with the use of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classification of similar input examples. During the training process, these subnetworks avoid overfitting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they must share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we have made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance of such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial distribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear activation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear activation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can result in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions. Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial distribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the introduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these activation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with a relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch normalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models. We show that by introducing maxout and batch normalisation units to the network in network model results in a model that produces classification results that are better than or comparable to the current state of the art in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets.},

abstract = {The brain processes information through many layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but it complicates learning by making it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame to a neuron by computing exactly how it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies error signals by matrices consisting of all the synaptic weights on the neuron's axon and farther downstream. This operation requires a precisely choreographed transport of synaptic weight information, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we present a surprisingly simple algorithm for deep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by random synaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful information from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In essence, the network learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism performs as quickly and accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems and describe the principles which underlie its function. Our demonstration provides a plausible basis for how a neuron can be adapted using error signals generated at distal locations in the brain, and thus dispels long-held assumptions about the algorithmic constraints on learning in neural circuits.},

abstract = {We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network" (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

This paper describes NTT's CHiME-3 system, which integrates advanced speech enhancement and recognition techniques. Newly developed techniques include the use of spectral masks for acoustic beam-steering vector estimation and acoustic modelling with deep convolutional neural networks based on the «network in network» concept. In addition to these improvements, our system has several key differences from the official baseline system. The differences include multi-microphone training, dereverberation, and cross adaptation of neural networks with different architectures. The impacts that these techniques have on recognition performance are investigated. By combining these advanced techniques, our system achieves a 3.45% development error rate and a 5.83% evaluation error rate. Three simpler systems are also developed to perform evaluations with constrained set-ups.},

abstract = {Structuring problems for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has attracted increasing attention over the past 20 years from both a conceptual and a practical perspective. This is reflected in a significant growth in the number of published applications which use a formal approach to problem structuring in combination with an analytic method for multi-criteria analysis. The problem structuring approaches (PSMs) include general methodologies such as Checkland's Soft Systems Method (SSM), Eden and Ackermann's Strategic Options Design and Analysis (SODA) and other methods that focus on a particular aspect. We carried out a literature review that covers eight PSMs (Cognitive and Causal Maps, DPSIR, Scenario Planning, SSM, Stakeholder Analysis, Strategic Choice Approach, SODA and SWOT) and seven MCDA methods (AHP, ANP, ELECTRE, MAUT, MAVT, PROMETHEE and TOPSIS). We first identified and analysed 333 articles published during 2000-2015, then selected 68 articles covering all PSM-MCDA combinations, which were studied in detail to understand the associated processes, benefits and challenges. The three PSMs most commonly combined with MCDA are SWOT, Scenario Planning and DPSIR. AHP was by far the most commonly applied MCDA method. Combining PSMs with MCDA produces a richer view of the decision situation and enables more effective support for different phases of the decision-making process. Some limitations and challenges in combining PSMs and MCDA are also identified, most importantly relating to building a value tree and assigning criteria weights.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the use of symmetric convolution and the discrete sine and cosine transforms (DST's & DCT's) for general digital signal processing. The operation of symmetric convolution is a formalized approach to convolving symmetrically extended sequences. The result is the same as that obtained by taking an inverse discrete trigonometric transform (DTT) of the product of the forward DTT's of those two sequences. There are 16 members in the family of DTT's. Each provides a representation for a corresponding distinct type of symmetric-periodic sequence. In this paper, we define symmetric convolution, relate the DST's and DCT's to symmetric-periodic sequences, and then use these principles to develop simple but powerful convolution-multiplication properties for the entire family of DST's and DCT's. Symmetric convolution can be used for discrete linear filtering when the filter is symmetric or antisymmetric. The filtering will be efficient because fast algorithms exist for all versions of the DTT's. Conventional linear convolution is possible if we first zero-pad the input data. Symmetric convolution and its fast implementation using DTT's are now an alternative to circular convolution and the DFT. \textcopyright1994 IEEE},

abstract = {Complex sound like speech can be characterized as the sum of number of amplitude-modulated signals representing the outputs of an array of narrow frequency bands. Temporal information at the output of each band can be separated into temporal fine structure (TFS), the rapid oscillations close to the center frequency and temporal envelope (ENV), slower amplitude modulations superimposed on the TFS. TFS information can be carried in the pattern of phase locking to the stimulus waveform, while ENV by the changes in firing rate over time. The relative importance of temporal ENV and TFS information in understanding speech has been studied using various sound-processing techniques. A number of studies demonstrated that ENV cues are associated with speech recognition in quiet, while TFS cues are possibly linked to melody/pitch perception and listening to speech in a competing background. However, there are evidences that recovered ENV from TFS as well as TFS itself may be partially responsible for speech recognition. Current technologies used in cochlear implants (CI) are not efficient in delivering the TFS cues, and new attempts have been made to deliver TFS information into sound-processing strategy in CI. We herein discuss the current updated findings of TFS with a literature review. \textcopyright2014 The Korean Audiological Society.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, the feedforward neural network (FNN) optimization has been a key interest among the researchers and practitioners of multiple disciplines. The FNN optimization is often viewed from the various perspectives: the optimization of weights, network architecture, activation nodes, learning parameters, learning environment, etc. Researchers adopted such different viewpoints mainly to improve the FNN's generalization ability. The gradient-descent algorithm such as backpropagation has been widely applied to optimize the FNNs. Its success is evident from the FNN's application to numerous real-world problems. However, due to the limitations of the gradient-based optimization methods, the metaheuristic algorithms including the evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., are still being widely explored by the researchers aiming to obtain generalized FNN for a given problem. This article attempts to summarize a broad spectrum of FNN optimization methodologies including conventional and metaheuristic approaches. This article also tries to connect various research directions emerged out of the FNN optimization practices, such as evolving neural network (NN), cooperative coevolution NN, complex-valued NN, deep learning, extreme learning machine, quantum NN, etc. Additionally, it provides interesting research challenges for future research to cope-up with the present information processing era.},

abstract = {Since their conception, electric systems have not been through large modifications regarding their topology, solutions and metrics. However, the use of sensors, communications, computational capacity and control to increase and improve the power system functionalities, concept known as Smart Grid (SG), has great potential to revolutionize the electric sector. Nonetheless, many difficulties emerge when implementing SG technologies in a large scale. These difficulties may be technical, financial, environmental, regulatory and managerial. In order to aid in this process, the goal of this research is to propose a novel approach on how to assess the performance of SG implementation projects. The approach is based on the multicriteria decision aid theory, specifically using the Multicriteria Decision Aid Constructive Approach (MCDA-C), due to its logical and data treatment structures. A case study to evaluate the MCDA-C application was conducted, in partnership with a local utility SG pilot-project. With the use of this novel approach, it was possible to build a quantitative roadmap to monitor and improve the project performance. The main contribution of this work is the novel approach proposed, an adaptive model based on a multicriteria decision aid method that can comprehensively assess the performance of any SG project.},

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review, the main four categories were labeled corruption, fraud, theft, and manipulation, respectively. Findings – There is a massive variety of crime types and crime names in the literature that can successfully be allocated to main categories of financial crime. Research limitations/implications – The paper is based on exploratory research to stimulate future research in refining and improving the categories suggested here. Practical implications – The great variety of criminal activities is classified in this paper so that practitioners can organize their thinking around crime themes rather than crime examples when mapping crime. Social implications The public and society at large will be able to understand the confusing variety of financial crime in terms of main categories. Originality/value – There has been some confusion among both researchers and practitioners when communicating about examples of financial crime. The organizing framework in this paper will help allocate crime examples to main categories of financial crime. \textcopyright2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Architectural novelties include fast two-dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset.

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze the emerging crowd-funding phenomenon, that is a collective effort by consumers who network and pool their money together, usually via the internet, in order to invest in and support efforts initiated by other people or organizations. Successful service businesses that organize crowd-funding and act as intermediaries are emerging, attesting to the viability of this means of attracting investment. Design/methodology/approach – The research employs a "grounded theory" approach, performing an in-depth qualitative analysis of three cases involving crowd-funding initiatives: SellaBand in the music business, Trampoline in financial services, and Kapipal in non-profit services. These cases were selected to represent a diverse set of crowd-funding operations that vary in terms of risk/return for the investor and the type of payoff associated to the investment. Findings – The research addresses two research questions: how and why do consumers turn into crowd-funding participants? and how and why do service providers set up a crowd-funding initiative? Concerning the first research question, the authors' findings reveal purposes, characteristics, roles and tasks, and investment size of crowd-funding activity from the consumer's point of view. Regarding the second research question, the authors' analysis reveals purposes, service roles, and network effects of crowd-funding activity investigated from the point of view of the service organization that set up the initiative. Practical implications – The findings also have implications for service managers interested in launching and/or managing crowd-funding initiatives. Originality/value – The paper addresses an emerging phenomenon and contributes to service theory in terms of extending the consumer's role from co-production and co-creation to investment. \textcopyright2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Evolving gradient-learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a popular approach to address the local optima and design problems of ANN. The typical approach is to combine the strength of backpropagation (BP) in weight learning and EA's capability of searching the architecture space. However, the BP's "gradient descent" approach requires a highly computer-intensive operation that relatively restricts the search coverage of EA by compelling it to use a small population size. To address this problem, we utilized mutation-based genetic neural network (MGNN) to replace BP by using the mutation strategy of local adaptation of evolutionary pogramming (EP) to effect weight learning. The MGNN's mutation enables the network to dynamically evolve its structure and adapt its weights at the same time. Moreover, MGNN's EP-based encoding scheme allows for a flexible and less restricted formulation of the fitness function and makes fitness computation fast and efficient. This makes it feasible to use larger population sizes and allows MGNN to have a relatively wide search coverage of the architecture space. MGNN implements a stopping criterion where overfitness occurrences are monitored through "sliding-windows" to avoid premature learning and overlearning. Statistical analysis of its performance to some well-known classification problems demonstrate its good generalization capability. It also reveals that locally adapting or scheduling the strategy parameters embedded in each individual network may provide a proper balance between the local and global searching capabilities of MGNN. \textcopyright2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Network in network (NiN) is an effective instance and an important extension of deep convolutional neural network consisting of alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers. Instead of using a linear filter for convolution, NiN utilizes shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP), a nonlinear function, to replace the linear filter. Because of the powerfulness of MLP and $ 1\times 1 $ convolutions in spatial domain, NiN has stronger ability of feature representation and hence results in better recognition performance. However, MLP itself consists of fully connected layers that give rise to a large number of parameters. In this paper, we propose to replace dense shallow MLP with sparse shallow MLP. One or more layers of the sparse shallow MLP are sparely connected in the channel dimension or channel-spatial domain. The proposed method is implemented by applying unshared convolution across the channel dimension and applying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational layers. The proposed method is called convolution in convolution (CiC). The experimental results on the CIFAR10 data set, augmented CIFAR10 data set, and CIFAR100 data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CiC method.},

abstract = {This paper presents a case study of research leading to a significant innovation in the acoustic guitar sector (1). The acoustic guitar is a result of centuries of design and development with wood, and has evolved into an archetypal and traditional product with a relatively conservative user base. As with many other product sectors, most acoustic guitars are now mass-produced in China, where low labour costs contribute to an average out-of-factory price of just $20 USID. This paper describes research into a dramatic shift in guitar materials, away from wood fabrication, towards the assembly of industrially moulded thermoplastic components. It is proposed that such a shift in materials can lead to competitive mass-manufacture of acoustic guitars outside of low labour cost countries, whilst invigorating the design of this popular musical instrument. Emphasis is placed on articulating the technical, aesthetic, market, and commercial requirements of a thermoplastic acoustic guitar. The crucial issue of sourcing appropriate forms of advice to aid product design is discussed. Focus is on the guitar soundboard, as the principal sound-generating component of the instrument. Three conclusions are reached, based on the patented soundboard technology that emerged from the research. First, instruments constructed. with foamed polycarbonate soundboards can rival the quality of wood counterparts, opening the way for a possible new industry of polymer musical instruments. Second, foamed polycarbonate soundboards have physical material properties surprisingly different to wood yet give equivalent acoustic performance. And third, innovation in this product sector benefits more from designerly ways of knowing and operating and less from scientific discoveries.},

abstract = {A longstanding goal in character animation is to combine data-driven specification of behavior with a system that can execute a similar behavior in a physical simulation, thus enabling realistic responses to perturbations and environmental variation. We show that well-known reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be adapted to learn robust control policies capable of imitating a broad range of example motion clips, while also learning complex recoveries, adapting to changes in morphology, and accomplishing userspecified goals. Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills. We demonstrate results using multiple characters (human, Atlas robot, bipedal dinosaur, dragon) and a large variety of skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.},

This book summarizes the field of bioplastics by illustrating how they form a unique class of research area that integrates pure and applied sciences such as chemistry, engineering and materials science, to initate solutions. Compelling science demystics this complex and often ambiguous branch of study for benefit of all those concerned with bioplastics. \textcopyright2011 Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Research has shown that many innovations originate not in the manufacturer but the user domain. Internet-based toolkits for idea competitions (TIC) are a novel way for manufacturers to access innovative ideas and solutions from users. Idea competitions build on the nature of competition as a means to encourage users to participate at an open innovation process, to inspire their creativity, and to increase the quality of the submissions. When the contest ends, submissions are evaluated by an expert panel. Users whose submissions score highest receive an award from the manufacturer, which is often granted in exchange for the right to exploit the solution in its domain. Following the idea of evolutionary prototyping, we developed a TIC in cooperation with a manufacturer of sports goods. The TIC was launched as a pilot in one of the company's markets. Submissions were evaluated using the consensual assessment technique. The evaluation of this study provides suggestions for further research, but also implications for managers willing to explore TIC in their organization. \textcopyright2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Nowadays, virtually no companies innovate alone. Firms team up with a variety of partners, in a wide number of ways, to create new technologies, products, and services. But what is the best way to leverage the power of outsiders? To help executives answer that question, Pisano, of Harvard Business School, and Verganti, of Politecnico di Milano, developed a simple framework focused on two questions: Given your strategy, how open or closed should your network of collaborators be? And who should decide which problems to tackle and which solutions to adopt? There are four basic modes of collaboration, say the authors. An elite circle is a closed network with a hierarchical governance: One company selects the participants, defines the problem, and chooses the solution. For instance, Alessi, an Italian home-products company, invited 200 outside experts in postmodern architecture to contribute ideas for new home-product designs. An innovation mall is hierarchical but open: Anyone can post a problem or propose solutions in it, but the company posting the problem chooses the solution. An example is lnnoCentive.com, an eBay-like site where companies post scientific challenges. An innovation community is open and decentralized: Anyone can propose problems, offer solutions, and decide which ideas to use - as happens in the Linux open-source software community. A consortium is a private group of participants that operate as equals and jointly select problems, decide how to conduct work, and choose solutions. IBM has set up a number of consortia with other companies to develop nextgeneration semiconductor technologies. No one approach is superior; each involves strategic trade-offs. When choosing among modes, firms must weigh their advantages and challenges, and assess which will work best with their strategy, capabilities, structure, and assets.},

abstract = {Generating ideas for new products used to be the exclusive domain of marketers, engineers, and/or designers. Users have only recently been recognized as an alternative source of new product ideas. Whereas some have attributed great potential to outsourcing idea generation to the "crowd" of users ("crowdsourcing"), others have clearly been more skeptical. The authors join this debate by presenting a real-world comparison of ideas actually generated by a firm's professionals with those generated by users in the course of an idea generation contest. Both professionals and users provided ideas to solve an effective and relevant problem in the consumer goods market for baby products. Executives from the underlying company evaluated all ideas (blind to their source) in terms of key quality dimensions including novelty, customer benefit, and feasibility. The study reveals that the crowdsourcing process generated user ideas that score significantly higher in terms of novelty and customer benefit, and somewhat lower in terms of feasibility. However, the average values for feasibility-in sharp contrast to novelty and customer benefit-tended to be relatively high overall, meaning that feasibility did not constitute a narrow bottleneck in this study. Even more interestingly, it is found that user ideas are placed more frequently than expected among the very best in terms of novelty and customer benefit. These findings, which are quite counterintuitive from the perspective of classic new product development (NPD) literature, suggest that, at least under certain conditions, crowdsourcing might constitute a promising method to gather user ideas that can complement those of a firm's professionals at the idea generation stage in NPD. \textcopyright2012 Product Development & Management Association.},

abstract = {A method based on the Fourier convolution theorem is developed for the analysis of data composed of random noise, plus an unknown constant "base line," plus a sum of (or an integral over a continuous spectrum of) exponential decay functions. The Fourier method's usual serious practical limitation of needing high accuracy data over a very wide range is eliminated by the introduction of convergence parameters and a Gaussian taper window. A computer program is described for the analysis of discrete spectra, where the data involves only a sum of exponentials. The program is completely automatic in that the only necessary inputs are the raw data (not necessarily in equal intervals of time); no potentially biased initial guesses concerning either the number or the values of the components are needed. The outputs include the number of components, the amplitudes and time constants together with their estimated errors, and a spectral plot of the solution. The limiting resolving power of the method is studied by analyzing a wide range of simulated two-, three-, and four-component data. The results seem to indicate that the method is applicable over a considerably wider range of conditions than nonlinear least squares or the method of moments. \textcopyright1976, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Symbolic pitch modeling is a way of incorporating knowledge about relations between pitches into the process of analyzing musical information or signals. In this paper, we propose a family of probabilistic symbolic polyphonic pitch models, which account for both the 'horizontal' and the 'vertical' pitch structure. These models are formulated as linear or log-linear interpolations of up to five sub-models, each of which is responsible for modeling a different type of relation. The ability of the models to predict symbolic pitch data is evaluated in terms of their cross-entropy, and of a newly proposed 'contextual cross-entropy' measure. Their performance is then measured on synthesized polyphonic audio signals in terms of the accuracy of multiple pitch estimation in combination with a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization-based acoustic model. In both experiments, the log-linear combination of at least one 'vertical' (e.g., harmony) and one 'horizontal' (e.g., note duration) sub-model outperformed a pitch-dependent Bernoulli prior by more than 60% in relative cross-entropy and 3% in absolute multiple pitch estimation accuracy. This work provides a proof of concept of the usefulness of model interpolation, which may be used for improved symbolic modeling of other aspects of music in the future. \textcopyright2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Appropriate definition of neural network architecture prior to data analysis is crucial for successful data mining. This can be challenging when the underlying model of the data is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimizing neural network architecture using genetic programming as a machine learning strategy would improve the ability of neural networks to model and detect nonlinear interactions among genes in studies of common human diseases. Results: Using simulated data, we show that a genetic programming optimized neural network approach is able to model gene-gene interactions as well as a traditional back propagation neural network. Furthermore, the genetic programming optimized neural network is better than the traditional back propagation neural network approach in terms of predictive ability and power to detect gene-gene interactions when non-functional polymorphisms are present. Conclusion: This study suggests that a machine learning strategy for optimizing neural network architecture may be preferable to traditional trial-and-error approaches for the identification and characterization of gene-gene interactions in common, complex human diseases. \textcopyright2003 Ritchie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In this chapter, we provide a broad overview of constitutive modeling in mechanics and thermomechanics. We describe how the constitutive equations must satisfy the second law of thermodynamics, conservation of angular momentum, material symmetry requirements, and invariance under superposed rigid body motions. Special attention is devoted to determining how various kinematic, kinetic, and thermodynamic quantities transform under a superposed rigid body motion and, in turn, how these transformations can be used to develop appropriate invariance requirements. We also examine useful thermodynamic concepts in constitutive modeling, such as thermomechanical processes and Legendre transformations.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an alternative type of neural network that can be used to reduce spectral variations and model spectral correlations which exist in signals. Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by CNNs as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the CNN framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 LVCSR tasks indicate that a CNN with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12%-14% relative improvement in WER over a strong DNN system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks.},

More recently, we have shown that the performance of sequence trained context dependent (CD) hidden Markov model (HMM) acoustic models using such LSTM RNNs can be equaled by sequence trained phone models initialized with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). In this paper, we present techniques that further improve performance of LSTM RNN acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We show that frame stacking and reduced frame rate lead to more accurate models and faster decoding. CD phone modeling leads to further improvements.

abstract = {Ant colony optimization (ACO) has been successfully applied to classification, where the aim is to build a model that captures the relationships between the input attributes and the target class in a given domain's dataset. The constructed classification model can then be used to predict the unknown class of a new pattern. While artificial neural networks are one of the most widely used models for pattern classification, their application is commonly restricted to fully connected three-layer topologies. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, ANN-Miner, which uses ACO to learn the structure of feed-forward neural networks. We report computational results on 40 benchmark datasets for several variations of the algorithm. Performance is compared to the standard three-layer structure trained with two different weight-learning algorithms (back propagation, and the ACOR algorithm), and also to a greedy algorithm for learning NN structures. A nonparametric Friedman test is used to determine statistical significance. In addition, we compare our proposed algorithm with NEAT, a prominent evolutionary algorithm for evolving neural networks, as well as three different well-known state-of-the-art classifiers, namely the C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm, the Ripper classification rule induction algorithm, and support vector machines.},

abstract = {Recently, there have been several promising methods to generate realistic imagery from deep convolutional networks. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to 'scribble' over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach can generate more realistic, more diverse, and more controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks have been exhibiting splendid accuracies in many of visual pattern classification problems. Many of the state-of-the-art methods employ a technique known as data augmentation at the training stage. This paper addresses an issue of decision rule for classifiers trained with augmented data. Our method is named as APAC: the Augmented PAttern Classification, which is a way of classification using the optimal decision rule for augmented data learning. Discussion of methods of data augmentation is not our primary focus. We show clear evidences that APAC gives far better generalization performance than the traditional way of class prediction in several experiments. Our convolutional neural network model with APAC achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy on the MNIST dataset among non-ensemble classifiers. Even our multilayer perceptron model beats some of the convolutional models with recently invented stochastic regularization techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset.},

abstract = {Despite the success of CNNs, selecting the optimal architecture for a given task remains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture, we propose a "fabric" that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size. We present benchmark results competitive with the state of the art for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR10, and for semantic segmentation on the Part Labels dataset.},

abstract = {Schumpeter began by proclaiming that histories of economics should confine themselves to economic analysis, which he defined as " the analytic or scientific aspects of economic thought" (1954: 1). Schumpeter then proceeded to ignore his own edict, for over 1000 small-print pages. Having preached analysis-only Schumpeter practiced more ecumenically, weaving together intellectual history, biography, and economic sociology. Indeed, Schumpeter spent most of his last decade writing the 800,000 words of the ferociously erudite History, and thereby failing to complete a long-planned work of economic analysis. Thomas McCraw's splendid new book brilliantly illuminates this Schumpeterian paradox, and the many others that made Schumpeter, as Phillip Mirowski put it, " a living, breathing contradiction " (1994: 5). Prophet of Innovation is not just a beautifully drawn portrait of Schumpeter's life and times, it is also a distinguished business historian's meditation on the two opposed cultures of political economy post-1870: history and theory. The Prophet of Innovation, among its other accomplishments, tells the story of how a great and productive intellect wrestled with the two-cultures problem in political economy. In the work of Schumpeter, McCraw finds the very personification of political economy's struggle between history and theory. Just as Schumpeter's work personifies the roles for history and theory in economics, so too does McCraw make Schumpeter's turbulent life and times a metaphor for Schumpeter's great subject, capitalism. Schumpeter was four when his father died. An exile, he moved his household 23 times in his lifetime, living in five different countries. His first marriage failed. Though brilliant and widely accomplished, Schumpeter had to reinvent himself many times. He failed as a lawyer, was dismissed as president of a private Vienna bank, and, as the new Austrian republic's finance minister, lasted a mere seven months. Most damaging of all, in 1926 Schumpeter's second wife Annie died in childbirth, and the child died as well. Schumpeter's beloved mother died in the same year, a three-fold emotional wounding from which Schumpeter, then 42, never fully recovered. Ahead still lay the Great Depression and another murderous war},

abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.},

The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language model. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We perform two sets of experiments. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and also investigate the effect of combining acoustic and music language model predictions using the proposed architecture. We compare performance of the neural network based acoustic models with two popular unsupervised acoustic models. Results show that convolutional neural network acoustic models yields the best performance across all evaluation metrics. We also observe improved performance with the application of the music language models. Finally, we present an efficient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0.

abstract = {Use of a bilinear conformai map to achieve a frequency warping nearly identical to that of the Bark frequency scale is described. Because the map takes the unit circle to itself, its form is that of the transfer function of a first-order allpass filter. Since it is a first-order map, it preserves the model order of rational systems, making it a valuable frequency warping technique for use in audio filter design. A closed-form weighted-equationor method is derived that computes the optimal mapping coefficient as a function of sampling rate, and the solution is shown to be generally indistinguishable from the optimal least-squares solution. The optimal Chebyshev mapping is also found to be essentially identical to the optimal least-squares solution. The expression 0.8517 [arctan(0.06583fs)]1/2-0.916 is shown to accurately approximate the optimal allpass coefficient as a function of sampling rate fs in kHz for sampling rates greater than 1 kHz. A filter design example is included that illustrates improvements due to carrying out the design over a Bark scale. Corresponding results are also given and compared for approximating the related "equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) scale≤ of Moore and Glasberg using a first-order allpass transformation. Due to the higher frequency resolution called for by the ERB scale, particularly at low frequencies, the first-order conformal map is less able to follow the desired mapping, and the error is two to three times greater than the Bark-scale case, depending on the sampling rate. \textcopyright1999 IEEE Publisher Item Identifier S 1063-6676(99)07979-1.},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate 'reasonable bounds' - linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

Because these components are multidimensional, and due to a strong distributed non-linearity (the snare interaction), many techniques used frequently in physical modeling synthesis applications, such as digital waveguides and modal methods are difficult to apply. In this article, finite difference time domain techniques are applied to a full 3D system, and various features of interest, such as the coupling between membranes, and the interaction between the membranes and the snares, are examined in detail. Also discussed are various numerical features, such as spurious splitting of degenerate modes and bandwidth limitation, and estimates of computational complexity are provided. Sound examples are presented.},

abstract = {Several methods have been proposed for solving multi-attribute decision making problems (MADM). A major criticism of MADM is that different techniques may yield different results when applied to the same problem. The problem considered in this study consists of a decision matrix input of N criteria weights and ratings of L alternatives on each criterion. The comparative performance of some methods has been investigated in a few, mostly field, studies. In this simulation experiment we investigate the performance of eight methods: ELECTRE, TOPSIS, Multiplicative Exponential Weighting (MEW), Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), and four versions of AHP (original vs. geometric scale and right eigenvector vs. mean transformation solution). Simulation parameters are the number of alternatives, criteria and their distribution. The solutions are analyzed using twelve measures of similarity of performance. Similarities and differences in the behavior of these methods are investigated. Dissimilarities in weights produced by these methods become stronger in problems with few alternatives; however, the corresponding final rankings of the alternatives vary across methods more in problems with many alternatives. Although less significant, the distribution of criterion weights affects the methods differently. In general, all AHP versions behave similarly and closer to SAW than the other methods. ELECTRE is the least similar to SAW (except for closer matching the top-ranked alternative), followed by MEW. TOPSIS behaves closer to AHP and differently from ELECTRE and MEW, except for problems with few criteria. A similar rank-reversal experiment produced the following performance order of methods: SAW and MEW (best), followed by TOPSIS, AHPs and ELECTRE. It should be noted that the ELECTRE version used was adapted to the common MADM problem and therefore it did not take advantage of the method's capabilities in handling problems with ordinal or imprecise information. \textcopyright1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Neural networks have al-ready been shown to perform well in fields related to ADT such as source separation and onset detection due to their utilisation of time-series data in classification. We pro-pose the use of neural networks for ADT in order to ex-ploit their ability to capture a complex configuration of fea-tures associated with individual or combined drum classes. In this paper we present a bi-directional recurrent neu-ral network for offline detection of percussive onsets from specified drum classes and a recurrent neural network suit-able for online operation. In both systems, a separate net-work is trained to identify onsets for each drum class under observation—that is, kick drum, snare drum, hi-hats, and combinations thereof. We perform four evaluations utilis-ing the IDMT-SMT-Drums and ENST minus one datasets, which cover solo percussion and polyphonic audio respec-tively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-sented methods for solo percussion and a capacity for iden-tifying snare drums, which are historically the most diffi-cult drum class to detect.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether neural networks (NNs), a realistic cognitive model of human information processing, can learn to backward induce in a two-stage game with a unique subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. The NNs were found to predict the Nash equilibrium approximately 70% of the time in new games. Similarly to humans, the neural network agents are also found to suffer from subgame and truncation inconsistency, supporting the contention that they are appropriate models of general learning in humans. The agents were found to behave in a bounded rational manner as a result of the endogenous emergence of decision heuristics. In particular a very simple heuristic socialmax, that chooses the cell with the highest social payoff explains their behavior approximately 60% of the time, whereas the ownmax heuristic that simply chooses the cell with the maximum payoff for that agent fares worse explaining behavior roughly 38%, albeit still significantly better than chance. These two heuristics were found to be ecologically valid for the backward induction problem as they predicted the Nash equilibrium in 67% and 50% of the games respectively. Compared to various standard classification algorithms, the NNs were found to be only slightly more accurate than standard discriminant analyses. However, the latter do not model the dynamic learning process and have an ad hoc postulated functional form. In contrast, a NN agent's behavior evolves with experience and is capable of taking on any functional form according to the universal approximation theorem.},

abstract = {We analyze a class of estimators based on convex relaxation for solving high-dimensional matrix decomposition problems. The observations are noisy realizations of a linear transformation X of the sum of an (approximately) low rank matrix with a second matrix endowed with a complementary form of low-dimensional structure; this set-up includes many statistical models of interest, including factor analysis, multi-task regression and robust covariance estimation. We derive a general theorem that bounds the Frobenius norm error for an estimate of the pair obtained by solving a convex optimization problem that combines the nuclear norm with a general decomposable regularizer. Our results use a "spikiness" condition that is related to, but milder than, singular vector incoherence. We specialize our general result to two cases that have been studied in past work: low rank plus an entrywise sparse matrix, and low rank plus a columnwise sparse matrix. For both models, our theory yields nonasymptotic Frobenius error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic noise matrices, and applies to matrices that can be exactly or approximately low rank, and matrices that can be exactly or approximately sparse. Moreover, for the case of stochastic noise matrices and the identity observation operator, we establish matching lower bounds on the minimax error. The sharpness of our nonasymptotic predictions is confirmed by numerical simulations. \textcopyrightInstitute of Mathematical Statistics, 2012.},

abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {The ventral visual pathway implements object recognition and categorization in a hierarchy of processing areas with neuronal selectivities of increasing complexity. The presence of massive feedback connections within this hierarchy raises the possibility that normal visual processing relies on the use of computational loops. It is not known, however, whether object recognition can be performed at all without such loops (i.e., in a purely feed-forward mode). By analyzing the time course of reaction times in a masked natural scene categorization paradigm, we show that the human visual system can generate selective motor responses based on a single feed-forward pass. We confirm these results using a more constrained letter discrimination task, in which the rapid succession of a target and mask is actually perceived as a distractor. We show that a masked stimulus presented for only 26 msecand often not consciously perceivedcan fully determine the earliest selective motor responses: The neural representations of the stimulus and mask are thus kept separated during a short period corresponding to the feedforward sweep. Therefore, feedback loops do not appear to be mandatory for visual processing. Rather, we found that such loops allow the masked stimulus to reverberate in the visual system and affect behavior for nearly 150 msec after the feed-forward sweep.},

It is widely recognized that phrasal information is crucial for sentiment classification. However, existing sentiment classification algorithms typically split a sentence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent sentiment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as 'not bad,' 'bad' and 'a great deal of,' 'great'. We address this issue by developing a joint framework for sentence-level sentiment classification. It simultaneously generates useful segmentations and predicts sentence-level polarity based on the segmentation results. Specifically, we develop a candidate generation model to produce segmentation candidates of a sentence; a segmentation ranking model to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classification; and a classification model for predicting the sentiment polarity of a segmentation. We train the joint framework directly from sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without using any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. We conduct experiments for sentiment classification on two benchmark datasets: a tweet dataset and a review dataset. Experimental results show that: 1) our method performs comparably with state-of-The-art methods on both datasets; 2) joint modeling segmentation and classification outperforms pipelined baseline methods in various experimental settings.},

abstract = {— Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parame-ters are randomly generated and the output weights are analyti-cally computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via 1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.

abstract = {Two main approaches are currently prevalent in the digital emulation of musical instruments: manipulation of pre-recorded samples and techniques of real-time synthesis, generally based on physical models with varying degrees of accuracy. Concerning the first, while the processing power of present-day computers enables their use in real-time, many restrictions arising from this sample-based design persist; the huge on disk space requirements and the stiffness of musical articulations being the most prominent. On the other side of the spectrum, pure synthesis approaches, while offering greater flexibility, fail to capture and reproduce certain nuances central to the verisimilitude of the generated sound, offering a dry, synthetic output, at a high computational cost. We propose a method where ensembles of lightweight neural networks working in parallel are learned, from crafted frequency-domain features of an instrument sound spectra, an arbitrary instrument's voice and articulations realistically and efficiently. We find that our method, while retaining perceptual sound quality on par with sampled approaches, exhibits 1/10 of latency times of industry standard real-time synthesis algorithms, and 1/100 of the disk space requirements of industry standard sample-based digital musical instruments. This method can, therefore, serve as a basis for more efficient implementations in dedicated devices, such as keyboards and electronic drumkits and in general purpose platforms, like desktops and tablets or open-source hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From a conceptual point of view, this work highlights the advantages of a closer integration of machine learning with other subjects, especially in the endeavor of new product development. Exploiting the synergy between neural networks, digital signal processing techniques and physical modelling, we illustrate the proposed method via the implementation of two virtual instruments: a conventional grand piano and a hibrid stringed instrument.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.},

abstract = {A large fraction of Internet traffic is now driven by requests from mobile devices with relatively small screens and often stringent bandwidth requirements. Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will significantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional LSTM recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efficient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32$\times$32 thumbnails, our LSTM-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) JPEG, JPEG2000 and WebP, with a storage size that is reduced by 10% or more.},

Each of the architectures we describe can provide variable compression rates during deployment without requiring retraining of the network: each network need only be trained once. All of our architectures consist of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoder and decoder, a binarizer, and a neural network for entropy coding. We compare RNN types (LSTM, associative LSTM) and introduce a new hybrid of GRU and ResNet. We also study "one-shot" versus additive reconstruction architectures and introduce a new scaled-additive framework. We compare to previous work, showing improvements of 4.3%-8.8% AUC (area under the rate-distortion curve), depending on the perceptual metric used. As far as we know, this is the first neural network architecture that is able to outperform JPEG at image compression across most bitrates on the rate-distortion curve on the Kodak dataset images, with and without the aid of entropy coding.},

The tuned filter characteristics of MWDFT is modified into more flat characteristic around the center frequency with negative feedback, which increases the bandwidth of the filter. An adaptive sampling pulse adjustment mechanism is incorporated in the proposed structure for online estimation of frequency. Hence, the frequency error was exploited to achieve synchronization between in-phase component of MWDFT and input signal of estimation. The amplitude is estimated in online from the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of MWDFT. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the existing techniques and experimentally validated on single-link flexible manipulator system for the online estimation of frequency and amplitude of tip deflection signal.

abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network. The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature. \textcopyright2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance - even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization schemes, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs, and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. For FNNs we considered (i) ReLU networks without normalization, (ii) batch normalization, (iii) layer normalization, (iv) weight normalization, (v) highway networks, and (vi) residual networks. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep.},

In this article we review the history and present techniques of physical modelling.

We concentrate on the digital waveguide modelling technique which has gained much popularity among both researchers and engineers in the music technology industry.

abstract = {In this work we propose a novel interpretation of residual networks showing that they can be seen as a collection of many paths of differing length. Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.},

These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d2) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields a speedup of D/4d, i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture.},

First, piecewise remodeling method is proposed based on the multi-layer parametric definition and contour curves are extracted from the mesh. Then, five types of proper constraints to support surface manipulation are proposed, and the draft-driven deformation by the contour curve bending can realize the interactive local surface design in free angle of view.

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks play an increasingly important role in computer vision tasks, especially in the field of visual object recognition. Many prominent models, such as Inception, Maxout, ResNet, and NIN, have been proposed to significantly improve recognition performance. Inspired from those models, we propose a novel module called self-adaptive module (SAM). SAM consists of four passes and one selector. Specifically, the four passes include two direct passes with different receptive fields and depths, one residual pass, and one Maxout pass. Actually, the residual pass is used to speed up convergence, while we take advantage of the Maxout pass to enhance approximate capabilities of SAM. The selector is further designed to help choose reasonable output. Basically, SAM is intended to simplify design of any new deep learning architecture, since it no longer requires consideration of how to select receptive fields and depths. Our SAM is tested on the visual object recognition datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN. The experimental results demonstrate that the SAM-Net has superior recognition performances on the four benchmarks, which achieve test errors of 5.76%, 28.56%, 0.31%, and 1.98%, respectively.},

abstract = {Fundamental developments in feedforward artificial neural networks from the past thirty years are reviewed. The central theme of this paper is a description of the history, origination, operating characteristics, and basic theory of several supervised neural network training algorithms including the Perceptron rule, the LMS algorithm, three Madaline rules, and the backpropagation technique. These methods were developed independently, but with the perspective of history they can all be related to each other. The concept underlying these algorithms is the "minimal disturbance principle," which suggests that during training it is advisable to inject new information into a network in a manner that disturbs stored information to the smallest extent possible. \textcopyright1990 IEEE},

The proposed method allows users to identify percussive events in complex mixtures with a minimal training set. The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two parts: percussive part with pre-defined drum templates and harmonic part with undefined entries. The harmonic part is able to adapt to the music content, allowing the algorithm to work in polyphonic mixtures. Drum event times can be simply picked from the percussive activation matrix with onset detection. The system is efficient and robust even with a minimal training set. The recognition rates for the ENST dataset vary from 56.7 to 78.9% for three percussive instruments extracted from polyphonic music.},

abstract = {Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as powerful sequence models have re-emerged as a potential acoustic model for statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS). The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can achieve significantly better performance on SPSS than deep feedforward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e.g., input gate, output gate, forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simplified architecture. The simplified architecture has significantly fewer parameters than an LSTM, thus reducing generation complexity considerably without degrading quality.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

In recent past, a lot of work in this area has produced advanced neuron models for both analog and binary data patterns. Popular among these are the higher-order neurons, fuzzy neurons and other polynomial neurons. In this paper, we propose a new neuron model based on a polynomial architecture. Instead of considering all the higher-order terms, a simple aggregation function is used. The aggregation function is considered as a product of linear functions in different dimensions of the space. The functional mapping capability of the proposed neuron model is demonstrated through some well known time series prediction problems and is compared with the standard multilayer neural network. \textcopyright2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Recurrent Neural Networks and their variants have shown promising performances in sequence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extractors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by factorizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained simultaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets and achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art models, even though our model architecture is orders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential data with RNN architectures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional sequential data.},

abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

abstract = {Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet.

abstract = {Different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques require different levels of computational intensity and may produce different outputs, so selecting an appropriate technique largely determines the quality of the recommended decision and the effort required to obtain that decision. In most real environments, criteria and their constraints are not deterministic and cannot be specified precisely; therefore, those criteria are uncertain or fuzzy. To facilitate the selection of an appropriate MCDM method under a fuzzy environment, this study investigates and statistically compares the performances of ten commonly used MCDM techniques: simple additive weights (SAW), weighted product method (WPM), compromise programming (CP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), four types of analytical hierarchy process (AHP), VIKOR (in Serbian: VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje), and ELECTRE (in French: ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalit\'e). These techniques' performances were compared using fuzzy criteria and constraints, matching the conditions usually found in real applications. To conduct the comparisons, the 10 multi-criteria decision ranking methods were applied to 1250 simulated sets of decision matrices with fuzzy triangular values, and 12,500 sets of ranks were analyzed to compare the ranking methods. SAW and TOPSIS had statistically similar performances. ELECTRE was not preferable in providing full, sorted ranks among the alternatives. VIKOR considering its ranking process, for specific conditions, assigns identical ranks for several alternatives; when full, sorted ranks are required, VIKOR is unfavorable, although it is a powerful technique in introducing the closest alternative to the ideal condition. Types 1 and 3 of AHP and types 2 and 4 of AHP had close performances. Notably, no ranking method was significantly sensitive to uncertainty levels when uncertainty changed symmetrically.},

Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.},

The use of unidirectional RNN architecture allows frame-synchronous streaming inference of output acoustic features given input linguistic features. The recurrent output layer further encourages smooth transition between acoustic features at consecutive frames.

We propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a "colorization Turing test," asking human participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools humans on 32% of the trials, significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover, we show that colorization can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature learning, acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on several feature learning benchmarks.},

Hybrid speech recognition systems incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models (HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks. Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it feasible to train an 'end-to-end' speech recognition system instead of hybrid settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.},

abstract = {Objective functions for training of deep networks for face-related recognition tasks, such as facial expression recognition (FER), usually consider each sample independently. In this work, we present a novel peak-piloted deep network (PPDN) that uses a sample with peak expression (easy sample) to supervise the intermediate feature responses for a sample of non-peak expression (hard sample) of the same type and from the same subject. The expression evolving process from non-peak expression to peak expression can thus be implicitly embedded in the network to achieve the invariance to expression intensities. A special purpose back-propagation procedure, peak gradient suppression (PGS), is proposed for network training. It drives the intermediate-layer feature responses of non-peak expression samples towards those of the corresponding peak expression samples, while avoiding the inverse. This avoids degrading the recognition capability for samples of peak expression due to interference from their non-peak expression counterparts. Extensive comparisons on two popular FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and CK+, demonstrate the superiority of the PPDN over state-ofthe-art FER methods, as well as the advantages of both the network structure and the optimization strategy. Moreover, it is shown that PPDN is a general architecture, extensible to other tasks by proper definition of peak and non-peak samples. This is validated by experiments that show state-of-the-art performance on pose-invariant face recognition, using the Multi-PIE dataset.},

abstract = {Realistic image manipulation is challenging because it requires modifying the image appearance in a user-controlled way, while preserving the realism of the result. Unless the user has considerable artistic skill, it is easy to "fall off" the manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we propose to learn the natural image manifold directly from data using a generative adversarial neural network. We then define a class of image editing operations, and constrain their output to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The model automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic as possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of constrained optimization and are applied in near-real time. We evaluate our algorithm on the task of realistic photo manipulation of shape and color. The presented method can further be used for changing one image to look like the other, as well as generating novel imagery from scratch based on user's scribbles.},

The method is based on sampling the traveling wave solution to the ideal wave equation and linearly filtering this solution to simulate dispersive effects due to stiffness and frequency-dependent loss; such digital filters may terminate the waveguide or be embedded along its length. For strings of high stiffness, however, dispersion filters can be difficult to design and expensive to implement. In this article, we show how high-quality time-domain terminating filters may be derived from given frequency-domain specifications which depend on the model parameters. Particular attention is paid to the problem of phase approximation, which, in the case of high stiffness, is strongly nonlinear. Finally, in the interest of determining the limits of applicability of digital waveguide techniques, we make a comparison with more conventional finite difference schemes, in terms of computational cost and numerical dispersion, for a set of string stiffness parameters. \textcopyrightS.

abstract = {The great importance of music in Etruscan civilization is attested by several ancient Greek and Latin authors, who place a strong emphasis on the aerophones such as auloi, conches, horns, and trumpets of various kinds-namely the Latin cornu, lituus, and tuba. This assertion has been confirmed in recent times by various scholars, who also take into account the large number of musical instruments and the wide range of iconographic evidence that have been found at Etruscan sites, which span from the beginning of the seventh century to the first century BCE. While the only specimens that survive are, of course, those made of nonperishable materials like metal or clay, the iconographic evidence-such as the tomb paintings and other kinds of representations-clearly show that almost all of the musical instruments that were widespread in the Mediterranean at the time were also used in Etruria on many different occasions, including public and private ceremonies, rituals, and daily life. Tantalizing glimpses of the earlier presence of perishable instruments-such as wooden pipes and string instruments-are provided by the surviving parts made of ivory or bone, including a few pipes, joints between pipe and reed, and plectra. One notable feature in the Etruscan context seems to be the complete lack of membranophones-in particular the frame drum-which had still not appeared by the turn of the fifth century, and by which time all of the other musical instruments were already firmly established in the area.},

The data are linearly transformed, and each component is then normalized by a pooled activity measure, computed by exponentiating a weighted sum of rectified and exponentiated components and a constant. We optimize the parameters of the full transformation (linear transform, exponents, weights, constant) over a database of natural images, directly minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The optimized transformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantly smaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative methods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is differentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a density model on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to samples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as a prior probability density that can be used to remove additive noise. Finally, we show that the transformation can be cascaded, with each layer optimized using the same Gaussianization objective, thus offering an unsupervised method of optimizing a deep network architecture.},

abstract = {The development of digital fabrication has reintroduced material processes with digital processes. There has been much discussion about the tool and the objects of the tool, but little discussion of the implication of the material process on the digital process. A brief historical review on the development of computer numerical control and the origins of the B\'ezier curve reveals an instrumental fact: computer numerical controlled tools necessitated advancements in computational surfaces which eventually led to NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces. In other words, the origins of NURBS surfaces resides in its relation to material processes, rather than many current approaches that develop free form surfaces and then force the tool onto the material without regard to the material properties. From this historical and mathematical review, this project develops toward more intelligent construction methods based on the integration of NURBS differential geometry paired with material qualities and processes. Specifically, a digital technique of developing conceptual NURBS geometry into piecewise surface patches are then flattened based on the material thickness and density. From these flattened patches, a material technique is developed to intelligently remove material to allow the rigid flat material to re-develop into physical surface patches. The goal of this research is to develop digital and material techniques toward intelligent construction based on the correspondence between digitally driven surface and digitally driven material processes. The application of this technique as a rational and flexible system is to support the dynamic response of form and material toward such performative aspects as structure, daylight, ventilation, and thermal properties.},

Recent technologies are directed towards the development of bio-green materials that exert negligible side- effects on the environment. A biologically-synthesized plastic, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), has been attracting major interests due to its similar physical properties to synthetic plastics. Unlike synthetic plastics, PHA is produced from renewable resources and is degraded aerobically by microorganisms to CO2 and H2O upon disposal. The selections of suitable bacterial strains, inexpensive carbon sources, efficient fermentation and recovery processes are important aspects that should be taken into consideration for the commercialization of PHA.

abstract = {The Drilling Performance Curve (DPC) is a simple yet powerful tool to assess the drilling performance in any given area where a consecutive series of similar wells have been drilled. All the information that is needed to perform the analysis is the sequence numbers of the well and the time it takes to reach a given depth. This paper presents some typical examples of DPC's covering a study of over 30 different areas (onshore and offshore) including over 2000 wells. From the data, a simple model for the overall drilling performance was derived. Three constants Ci, C2 and C3 are unique to the DPC. From the numerical value of the constants, the drilling performance can be derived. For example, the Ci constant indicates how well an operation is prepared to drill a given location and/or how difficult the area is to drill. The C2 constant directly reflects the rate of learning. The C3 constant indicates the level of technology and organization for drilling in a particular area. This paper will present cases from poor to excellent drilling with the associated coefficients. It will be shown that the DPC can dictate the strategy for a drilling program and what the economics of drilling a sequence of wells should be in a given area. It is suggested that the DPC become the yardstick for evaluating drilling, much as the decline curve is for production.},

The adaptation, in essence, allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive yet rarely observed features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies the task of setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments on a text classification task, showing substantial improvements for classification with sparse datasets.},

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have seen wide success at generating images that are both locally and globally coherent, but they have seen little application to audio generation. In this paper we introduce WaveGAN, a first attempt at applying GANs to unsupervised synthesis of raw-waveform audio. WaveGAN is capable of synthesizing one second slices of audio waveforms with global coherence, suitable for sound effect generation. Our experiments demonstrate that-without labels-WaveGAN learns to produce intelligible words when trained on a smallvocabulary speech dataset, and can also synthesize audio from other domains such as drums, bird vocalizations, and piano. We compare WaveGAN to a method which applies GANs designed for image generation on image-like audio feature representations, finding both approaches to be promising.},

abstract = {The one-dimensional digital waveguides, combined with the commuted synthesis method, allow modeling and high-quality synthesis of plucked string instrument tones in a very efficient manner. However, the increasing computational power of the modern processors makes it feasible to experiment with more complex algorithms also for real-time sound synthesis purposes. By certain simplifications, time-domain methods based on finite differences (FDTD) are efficient enough to run in real time on modern processors and yet they are more flexible than the computationally less expensive commuted synthesis. The resulting structures, which are called 1-D FDTD waveguides, have previously been shown to be equal to or to approximate many properties of digital waveguides, including lossless and lossy propagation, input and output ports, terminations, and scattering junctions. The numerical stability of the 1-D FDTD waveguides, as well as their initialization and formation of the traveling waves are well understood. However, a careful comparison between 1-D FDTD waveguides and conventional digital waveguides in terms of their limitations, computational efficiency, accuracy, and interaction has not been carried out. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by highlighting important properties of both methods side by side in string instrument modeling and synthesis. We then try to combine the best properties of both methods and discuss the interaction of the two model structures. Synthetic tones and short musical phrases obtained by both synthesis models will be demonstrated during the presentation.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Children who received at least three years (M=4.6 years) of instrumental music training outperformed their control counterparts on two outcomes closely related to music (auditory discrimination abilities and fine motor skills) and on two outcomes distantly related to music (vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning skills). Duration of training also predicted these outcomes. Contrary to previous research, instrumental music training was not associated with heightened spatial skills, phonemic awareness, or mathematical abilities. Conclusions/Significance: While these results are correlational only, the strong predictive effect of training duration suggests that instrumental music training may enhance auditory discrimination, fine motor skills, vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning.

Here we use image representations derived from Convolutional Neural Networks optimised for object recognition, which make high level image information explicit. We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous wellknown artworks.

abstract = {— Financial forecasting is an example of a signal processing problem w hi ch is challenging due to Small sizes, high noi se, non-stationarity, and non-linearity,but fast forecasting of stock market price is very important for strategi c business planning.Present study is aimed to develop a comparative predictive model w ith Feedforward Multilayer Arti ficial Neural Netw ork & Recurr ent Time Delay Neural Netw ork for the Financial Timeseries Prediction.This study is developed with the help of histori cal stockprice dataset made a vailable by GoogleFinance.To develop this prediction model Backpropagation method w ith Gradient Descent learning has been implemented.Finally the Neural Net ,learned w ith said algorithm is found to be skillful predictor for non-stationary noisy Financial Timeseries. Over past fifteen years, a view has emerged that computing based on models inspired by our understanding of the structure and function of the biological neural networks may hold the key to the success of solving intelligent tasks by machines like noisy time series prediction and more[1]. A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor that has a natural propensity for storing experiential knowledge and making it available for use. It resembles the brain in two respects: Knowledge is acquired by the network through a learning process and interneuron connection strengths known as synaptic weights are used to store the knowledge[2]. Moreover, recently the Markets have become a more accessible investment tool, not only for strategic investors but for common people as well. Consequently they are not only related to macroeconomic parameters, but they influence everyday life in a more direct way. Therefore they constitute a mechanism which has important and direct social impacts. The characteristic that all Stock Markets have in common is the uncertainty, which is related with their short and long-term future state. This feature is undesirable for the investor but it is also unavoidable whenever the Stock Market is selected as the investment tool. The best that one can do is to try to reduce this uncertainty. Stock Market Prediction (or Forecasting) is one of the instruments in this process. We cannot exactly predict what will happen tomorrow, but from previous experiences we can roughly predict tomorrow. In this paper this knowledge based approach is taken. The accuracy of the predictive system which is made by ANN can be tuned with help of different network architectures. Network is consists of input layer ,hidden layer & output layer of neuron, no of neurons per layer can be configured according to the needed result accuracy & throughput,there is no cut & bound rule for that.the network can be trained by using sample training data set,this neural network model is very much useful for mapping unknown functional dependencies between different input & output tuples.In this paper two types of neural network architecture,feed forward multilayer network & timedelay recurrent network is used for the prediction of the NASDAQ stock price.A comparative error study for both network architecture is introduced in this paper.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin.

abstract = {Separating singing voices from music accompaniment is an important task in many applications, such as music information retrieval, lyric recognition and alignment. Music accompaniment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace, because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method. Evaluations on the MIR-1K dataset show that this method can achieve around 1∼1.4 dB higher GNSDR compared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior training or requiring particular features.},

Colorizing, when done manually in Photoshop, a single picture might take months to get exactly correct. Understanding the tediousness of the task and inspired by the benefits of artificial intelligence, we propose a mechanism to automate the coloring process with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Firstly, an Alpha version is developed which successfully works on trained images but fails to colorize images, and the network has never seen before. Subsequently, a Beta version is implemented which is able to overcome the limitations of Alpha version and works well for untrained images. To further enhance the network, we fused the deep CNN with a classifier called Inception ResNet V2 which is a pre-trained model. Finally, the training results are observed for all the versions followed by a comparative analysis for trained and untrained images.},

Their equal capabilities in physical modeling have been shown for special cases and have been assumed to cover generalized cases as well. The ability to form mixed models by joining substructures of both classes through converter elements has been proposed recently. In this paper, we formulate a general digital signal processing (DSP)-oriented framework where the functional equivalence of these two approaches is systematically elaborated and the conditions of building mixed models are studied.

abstract = {The convergence of back-propagation learning is analyzed so as to explain common phenomenon observed by practitioners. Many undesirable behaviors of backprop can be avoided with tricks that are rarely exposed in serious technical publications. This paper gives some of those tricks, and offers explanations of why they work. Many authors have suggested that second-order optimization methods are advantageous for neural net training. It is shown that most "classical" second-order methods are impractical for large neural networks. A few methods are proposed that do not have these limitations.},

abstract = {LSTM, GRU, and more advanced recurrent neural networksLike Markov models, Recurrent Neural Networks are all about learning sequences - but whereas Markov Models are limited by the Markov assumption, Recurrent Neural Networks are not - and as a result, they are more expressive, and more powerful than anything we've seen on tasks that we haven't made progress on in decades.In the first section of the course we are going to add the concept of time to our neural networks.I'll introduce you to the Simple Recurrent Unit, also known as the Elman unit.We are going to revisit the XOR problem, but we're going to extend it so that it becomes the parity problem - you'll see that regular feedforward neural networks will have trouble solving this problem but recurrent networks will work because the key is to treat the input as a sequence.In the next section of the book, we are going to revisit one of the most popular applications of recurrent neural networks - language modeling.One popular application of neural networks for language is word vectors or word embeddings. The most common technique for this is called Word2Vec, but I'll show you how recurrent neural networks can also be used for creating word vectors.In the section after, we'll look at the very popular LSTM, or long short-term memory unit, and the more modern and efficient GRU, or gated recurrent unit, which has been proven to yield comparable performance.We'll apply these to some more practical problems, such as learning a language model from Wikipedia data and visualizing the word embeddings we get as a result.All of the materials required for this course can be downloaded and installed for FREE. We will do most of our work in Numpy, Matplotlib, and Theano. I am always available to answer your questions and help you along your data science journey.See you in class!"Hold up... what's deep learning and all this other crazy stuff you're talking about?"If you are completely new to deep learning, you might want to check out my earlier books and courses on the subject:Deep Learning in Python https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CVJ19E8Deep Learning in Python Prerequisities https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D7GDRQ2Much like how IBM's Deep Blue beat world champion chess player Garry Kasparov in 1996, Google's AlphaGo recently made headlines when it beat world champion Lee Sedol in March 2016.What was amazing about this win was that experts in the field didn't think it would happen for another 10 years. The search space of Go is much larger than that of chess, meaning that existing techniques for playing games with artificial intelligence were infeasible. Deep learning was the technique that enabled AlphaGo to correctly predict the outcome of its moves and defeat the world champion.Deep learning progress has accelerated in recent years due to more processing power (see: Tensor Processing Unit or TPU), larger datasets, and new algorithms like the ones discussed in this book.},

abstract = {We present a novel training framework for neural sequence models, particularly for grounded dialog generation. The standard training paradigm for these models is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), or minimizing the cross-entropy of the human responses. Across a variety of domains, a recurring problem with MLE trained generative neural dialog models (G) is that they tend to produce 'safe' and generic responses ('I don't know', 'I can't tell'). In contrast, discriminative dialog models (D) that are trained to rank a list of candidate human responses outperform their generative counterparts; in terms of automatic metrics, diversity, and informativeness of the responses. However, D is not useful in practice since it can not be deployed to have real conversations with users. Our work aims to achieve the best of both worlds - the practical usefulness of G and the strong performance of D - via knowledge transfer from D to G. Our primary contribution is an end-to-end trainable generative visual dialog model, where G receives gradients from D as a perceptual (not adversarial) loss of the sequence sampled from G. We leverage the recently proposed Gumbel-Softmax (GS) approximation to the discrete distribution - specifically, a RNN augmented with a sequence of GS samplers, coupled with the straight-through gradient estimator to enable end-to-end differentiability. We also introduce a stronger encoder for visual dialog, and employ a self-attention mechanism for answer encoding along with a metric learning loss to aid D in better capturing semantic similarities in answer responses. Overall, our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art on the VisDial dataset by a significant margin (2.67% on recall@10).

abstract = {Acoustical physical modelling synthesis uses mathematical algorithms to describe a real-world sound production process or propagational environ-ment. Digital waveguides can be used to form a 1D model of the vocal tract, simplistically represented as a series of cylindrical tubes of varying radius along a straight axis. This 1D signal propagating element can also be extended to create a digital waveguide mesh (DWM), giving acoustical synthesis of a higher dimensional structure, such as a 2D surface or 3D space. The work contained in this thesis is an investigation into the effects of increased dimensionality in the 1D waveguide vocal tract paradigm. A 2D DWM is configured as a model of the tract, such that shape characteristics are set within the width of the mesh. Wave propagation and reflection is simulated along the tract from the glottis to the lips, as well as across it, between the two inner walls, thereby removing plane-wave limitations inherent in the 1D model. The 2D tract is found to give accurate formant synthesis, producing vowels that give a good match to real-world targets. However, problems associated with high sampling frequency limitations and discontinuous dynamic operation are identified. Movements readily occurring in speech, such as diphthongs, are not easily accommodated by the static mesh structure. A novel alternative approach is also presented which maintains a rect-angular mesh, but maps the changing tract shapes onto the waveguide impedances. This allows for stable dynamic manipulation of the modelled space. Furthermore, sampling frequency limitations are removed, such that real-time operation and interaction with the 2D tract model is achieved. i Contents Abstract i Acknowledgments xi Declaration xii},

Our general approach is based on measuring the directivity of an acoustic violin, and designing a digital filter structure that mimics the observed directivity while allowing interactive operation. The digital filter structure is fed by the electrical signal coming from a silent electric violin as played by a musician. In a hemi-anechoic chamber, we use a microphone array to characterize the frequency-dependent directivity transfer function of a real violin by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the acoustic pressure at 4320 points on a sphere surrounding the instrument. From the input force and output pressure signals obtained from the real violin measurements, we use deconvolution to estimate 4320 impulse responses each corresponding to a radiation direction. With such impulse responses, we use State Wave Synthesis to model the observed directivity in time-varying conditions and efficiently render directional wavefronts in a virtual environment. We characterize the silent violin transfer function by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the electrical signal at its output, leading to an impulse response that we use to design an inverse filter to recover the force excitation at the bridge.},

Natural/Biofiber composites (Bio-Composites) are emerging as a viable alternative to glass fiber reinforced composites especially in automotive and building product applications. The combination of biofibers such as kenaf, hemp, flax, jute, henequen, pineapple leaf fiber, and sisal with polymer matrices from both nonrenewable and renewable resources to produce composite materials that are competitive with synthetic composites requires special attention, i.e., biofiber-matrix interface and novel processing.

abstract = {Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has remained a challenging and interesting problem in computer vision. Despite efforts made in developing various methods for FER, existing approaches lack generalizability when applied to unseen images or those that are captured in wild setting (i.e. the results are not significant). Most of the existing approaches are based on engineered features (e.g. HOG, LBPH, and Gabor) where the classifier's hyper-parameters are tuned to give best recognition accuracies across a single database, or a small collection of similar databases. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture to address the FER problem across multiple well-known standard face datasets. Specifically, our network consists of two convolutional layers each followed by max pooling and then four Inception layers. The network is a single component architecture that takes registered facial images as the input and classifies them into either of the six basic or the neutral expressions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on seven publicly available facial expression databases, viz. MultiPIE, MMI, CK+, DISFA, FERA, SFEW, and FER2013. The results of our proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods and better than traditional convolutional neural networks in both accuracy and training time.},

abstract = {Innovation and creativity are key aspects of design and technological activity. The development of the polymer acoustic guitar at Loughborough University has been recognised as a highly innovative project having received three innovation awards from major bodies. This paper describes three key aspects of the development, in particular the capability to imagine future possibilities, the role of knowledge and appropriate prototyping. These aspects lie at the heart of the innovation, although, of course, the whole activity was supported by key design skills, such as drawing and CAD. Some aspects of design epistemology (ways of knowing that facilitate designing) are discussed using evidence from this project, for example, the roles of ‘knowing that' and ‘knowing how' and the supposed tension between ‘craft skills' and ‘modern technology'. The importance of fitness for purpose when prototyping is emphasised and the link to the problems associated with product outcomes and innovation noted. A model of design and technological activity is discussed which emphasises the role of knowledge in realising design possibilities. This model was first presented at DATA's Millennium Conference (Norman 2000) and is a modification of one discussed by Roberts (1992). It incorporates the idea of technology for design as the summation of knowledge, skills and values (Norman, 1998) and provides an alternative way of thinking about design and technological activity. It is argued that existing ideas surrounding ‘the design process', as represented by a series of stages derived from systems analysis, are a significant stumbling block to promoting innovation.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study [30] revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call 'fooling images' (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},

Physics and engineering depend so heavily on the subject, it is hard to imag- ine even mentioning them without thinking immediately about frequency- dependent phenomena: light, sound, orbits, and vibrations to name a few. Many other scientific fields also are highly dependent upon Fourier Analy- sis for understanding even the most basic of phenomena, such as population dynamics in biology. Fourier Analysis is also essential in understanding what are some of the most common occurrences in everyday life. The various peri- odic phenomena of the sun, the moon, the tides, and the seasons are yet to be completely understood. We know the sun and moon will rise with certainty, and their secondary seasonal effect on wind and tide-related phenomena such as el Nino are still somewhat of a mystery. These periodic effects are drastic and life altering, and are naturally studied with Fourier Analysis.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Recent research in economic geography has emphasized tacit knowledge as the basis of industrial learning. In contrast, codification and the practices of industrial writing have received little attention for the roles they play in mobilizing knowledge across space. This paper offers insight into the geographies of codification through an examination of technology transfer in the electronic musical instrument industry between 1965 and 1995. The research draws on a variety of primary and secondary data that include interviews with inventors, biographical accounts and patent analysis. These sources offer perspective on the career trajectories of three U.S. inventors who transferred knowledge from various contexts in California's high-tech industry to the Japanese firm, Yamaha. Conceptually, the paper draws on the actor-network theory and Latour's idea of translation to highlight the detours inventors must take to register novelty. The analysis reveals the problematic nature of codified knowledge and its transfer; in this case codified knowledge was mobile internationally but not locally, at least until it reached Japan. The paper argues for the need to understand how texts such as patents are produced-the context of their authorship, the geographies of their circulation and their efficacy for shaping further innovative practice. \textcopyright2006 Canadian Association of Geographers/L'Association canadienne des g\'eographes.},

Deep learning makes it possible to discover powerful representations that are capable of capturing the latent structure of highdimensional data such as music. By creating interactive latent space "palettes" of musical sequences and timbres, we demonstrate interfaces for musical creation made possible by machine learning. We introduce an interface to the intuitive, low-dimensional control spaces for high-dimensional note sequences, allowing users to explore a compositional space of melodies or drum beats in a simple 2-D grid. Furthermore, users can define 1-D trajectories in the 2-D space for autonomous, continuous morphing during improvisation. Similarly for timbre, our interface to a learned latent space of audio provides an intuitive and smooth search space for morphing between the timbres of different instruments. We remove technical and computational barriers by embedding pre-trained networks into a browser-based GPU-accelerated framework, making the systems accessible to a wide range of users while maintaining potential for creative flexibility and personalization.},

Cassava-based bioplastic sheet had the worst water repellent while corn starch-based bioplastic sheets had the lowest water absorption percentage. Based on the ratios, bioplastic sheet N30%:B70% shows the lowest percentage of water absorption. Result also showed that as the amount of bioplastic ratio increase, the tensile strength decrease. The optimum mixture of fibres/bioplastic was N50%:B50% which obtained highest percentage of tensile strength. Elongation at break was increased as the bioplastic increased.},

abstract = {Programming by example (PBE) systems allow end users to easily create programs by providing a few input-output examples to specify their intended task. The system attempts to generate a program in a domain specific language (DSL) that satisfies the given examples. However, a key challenge faced by existing PBE techniques is to ensure the robustness of the programs that are synthesized from a small number of examples, as these programs often fail when applied to new inputs. This is because there can be many possible programs satisfying a small number of examples, and the PBE system has to somehow rank between these candidates and choose the correct one without any further information from the user. In this work we present a different approach to PBE in which the system avoids making a ranking decision at the synthesis stage, by instead synthesizing a disjunctive program that includes the many possible top-ranked programs as possible alternatives and selects between these different choices upon execution on a new input. This delayed choice brings the important benefit of comparing the possible outputs produced by the different disjuncts on a given input at execution time. We present a generic framework for synthesizing such disjunctive programs in arbitrary DSLs, and describe two concrete implementations of disjunctive synthesis in the practical domains of data extraction from plain text and HTML documents. We present an evaluation showing the significant increase in robustness achieved with our disjunctive approach, as illustrated by an increase from 59% to 93% of tasks for which correct programs can be learnt from a single example.},

It is proposed in this paper to jointly model the inharmonicity and tuning of pianos on the whole compass. While using a small number of parameters, these models are able to reflect both the specificities of instrument design and tuner's practice. An estimation algorithm is derived that can run either on a set of isolated note recordings, but also on chord recordings, assuming that the played notes are known. It is applied to extract parameters highlighting some tuner's choices on different piano types and to propose tuning curves for out-of-tune pianos or piano synthesizers.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the problem of locating singing voice in music tracks. As opposed to most existing methods for this task, we rely on the extraction of the characteristics speciﬁc to singing voice. In our approach we suppose that the singing voice is characterized by harmonicity, formants, vibrato and tremolo. In the present study we deal only with the vibrato and tremolo characteristics. For this, we ﬁrst extract sinusoidal partials from the musical audio signal . The frequency modulation (vibrato) and amplitude modulation (tremolo) of each partial are then studied to determine if the partial corresponds to singing voice and hence the corresponding segment is supposed to contain singing voice. For this we estimate for each partial the rate (frequency of the modulations) and the extent (amplitude of modulation) of both vibrato and tremolo. A partial selection is then operated based on these values. A second criteria based on harmonicity is also introduced. Based on this, each segment can be labelled as singing or non-singing. Post-processing of the segmentation is then applied in order to remove short-duration segments. The proposed method is then evaluated on a large manually annotated test-set. The results of this evaluation are compared to the one obtained with a usual machine learning approach (MFCC and SFM modeling with GMM). The proposed method achieves very close results to the machine learning approach : 76.8\% compared to 77.4\% F-measure (frame classiﬁcation). This result is very promising, since both approaches are orthogonal and can then be combined.},

abstract = {Along with the development of learning and vision, Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) has become a popular algorithm for separable optimization model with linear constraint. However, the ADMM and its numerical variants (e.g., inexact, proximal or linearized) are awkward to obtain state-of-The-Art performance when dealing with complex learning and vision tasks due to their weak task-Adaption ability. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in incorporating task-specific computational modules (e.g., designed filters or learned architectures) into ADMM iterations. Unfortunately, these task-related modules introduce uncontrolled and unstable iterative flows, they also break the structures of the original optimization model. Therefore, existing theoretical investigations are invalid for these resulted task-specific iterations. In this paper, we develop a simple and generic proximal ADMM framework to incorporate flexible task-specific module for learning and vision problems. We rigorously prove the convergence both in objective function values and the constraint violation and provide the worst-case convergence rate measured by the iteration complexity. Our investigations not only develop new perspectives for analyzing task-Adaptive ADMM but also supply meaningful guidelines on designing practical optimization methods for real-world applications. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithmic framework.},

abstract = {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.

abstract = {Sound synthesis and processing has been the most active research topic in the field of Sound and Music Computing for more than 40 years. Quite a number of the early research results are now standard components of many audio and music devices and new technologies are continuously being developed and integrated into new products. Through the years there have been important changes. For example, most of the abstract algorithms that were the focus of work in the 70s and 80s are considered obsolete. Then the 1990s saw the emergence of computational approaches that aimed either at capturing the characteristics of a sound source, known as physical models, or at capturing the perceptual characteristics of the sound signal, generally referred to as spectral or signal models. More recent trends include the combination of physical and spectral models and the corpus-based concatenative methods. But the field faces major challenges that might revolutionize the standard paradigms and applications of sound synthesis. In this article we will first place the sound synthesis topic within its research context, then we will highlight some of the current trends, and finally we will attempt to identify some challenges for the future. \textcopyright2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed. \textcopyrightSpringer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract = {Deep learning has been shown as a successful machine learning method for a variety of tasks, and its popularity results in numerous open-source deep learning software tools coming to public. Training a deep network is usually a very time-consuming process. To address the huge computational challenge in deep learning, many tools exploit hardware features such as multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs to shorten the training and inference time. However, different tools exhibit different features and running performance when they train different types of deep networks on different hardware platforms, making it difficult for end users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we present our attempt to benchmark several state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated deep learning software tools, including Caffe, CNTK, TensorFlow, and Torch. We focus on evaluating the running time performance (i.e., speed) of these tools with three popular types of neural networks on two representative CPU platforms and three representative GPU platforms. Our contribution is two-fold. First, for end users of deep learning software tools, our benchmarking results can serve as a reference to selecting appropriate hardware platforms and software tools. Second, for developers of deep learning software tools, our in-depth analysis points out possible future directions to further optimize the running performance.},

abstract = {Music synthesis based on a physical model promises the highest quality when it comes to imitating natural instruments. Because the artificial instrument can have the same control parameters as the real instrument, expressivity of control is unbounded. Historically, physical models have led to prohibitively expensive synthesis algorithms, and commercially available synthesizers do not yet appear to make use of them. These days, most synthesizers use either processed digital recordings ("sampling synthesis") or an abstract algorithm such as frequency modulation (FM). However, as computers become faster and cheaper, and as algorithms based on physical models become more efficient, we may expect to hear more from them. Most attempts to synthesize sounds based on a physical model have been based on numerical integration of the wave equation (covered in any textbook on acoustics). These methods generally require at least one operation (multiplication and/or addition) for each point on a grid that permeates the instrument. In principle, the grid spacing must be less than half a wavelength at the highest audio frequency. This is essentially why the computational costs are so high in "brute force" numerical solutions of the wave equation. More recently developed "digital waveguide" methods follow a different path to the physical model; the wave equation is first solved in a general way to obtain traveling waves in the medium interior. The traveling waves are explicitly simulated in the waveguide model, in contrast to computing a physical variable. (The traveling waves must be summed together to produce a physical output.) In the lossless case, a traveling wave between two points in the medium can be simulated using nothing but a digital delay line. In the general linear case, in which there are frequency-dependent losses and dispersion, the commutativity of linear time-invariant systems allows the losses and dispersion to be lumped at discrete points such that most of the simulation still consists of multiply-free delay lines. This is essentially why computational costs are so low in "waveguide synthesis" algorithms. Computer-music programmers know very well that a delay line can be implemented by a single fetch, store, and pointer update for each sample of output. If the delay line is, say, 500 samples long (corresponding to a pitch of 44,100/500=88 Hz in a string or bore model of compact disk quality), computational requirements relative to "brute force" numerical integration on the grid are reduced by three orders of magnitude. As a result, for very simple physical models, several CD-quality voices can be sustained in real time on a single digital signal processing (DSP) chip costing only a few dollars. This article develops waveguide synthesis beginning with the wave equation for vibrating strings. Transverse waves on a string are taken as the primary example due to the relative clarity of the underlying physics, but the formulation for string simulation is unified with that of the acoustic tube. The technique of lumping losses at discrete points in the waveguide, replacing more expensive distributed losses, is described.},

Beginning in the early eighties, the personal computer (PC) market has been the dominant market influencing the semiconductor industry. Single-chip microprocessors (MPUs) enabled what became the huge PC market, which ultimately overshadowed the earlier minicomputer and mainframe computer markets. The popularity of PCs led to investments in increasingly more powerful MPUs and memory chips of ever-growing capacity. MPUs and DRAMs became the semiconductor industry technology drivers for the data processing needs of the PC. But now, DSP, as opposed to conventional data processing, has become the major technology driver for the semiconductor industry as evidenced by its market growth and the fervour of chip vendors to provide new products based on DSP technology. The increasing need to digitally process analog information signals, like audio and video, is causing a major shift in the semiconductor business. Since DSP is the mathematical manipulation of those digitized information signals, specialized math circuitry is required for efficient signal processing-circuitry that was previously confined to classical DSP chips},

abstract = {Several recent works have used deep convolutional networks to generate realistic imagery. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to scribble over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach generates more realistic, diverse, and controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.},

Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-The-Art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-Agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

We accomplish the goal by applying the proposed Min-Max objective to a layer below the output layer of a CNN model in the course of training. The Min-Max objective explicitly ensures that the feature maps learned by a CNN model have the minimum within-manifold distance for each object manifold and the maximum between-manifold distances among different object manifolds. The Min-Max objective is general and able to be applied to different CNNs with insignificant increases in computation cost. Moreover, an incremental minibatch training procedure is also proposed in conjunction with the Min-Max objective to enable the handling of large-scale training data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on several benchmark data sets with both the image classification and face verification tasks reveal that employing the proposed Min-Max objective in the training process can remarkably improve performance accuracies of a CNN model in comparison with the same model trained without using this objective.},

abstract = {I introduced a max-margin,structure prediction framework based on Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) for nding hierarchical structure in multiple modalities. Recursion in this case pertains to the idea that the same neural network is applied repeatedly on different components of a sentence. Since this model showed much promise for both language and image understanding, I decided to further investigate the space of recursive deep learning models. In this thesis, I explore model variations along three major axes in order to gain insights into hierarchical feature learning, building fast, practical, state of the art NLP systems and semantic compositionality, the important quality of natural language that allows speakers to determine the meaning of a longer expression based on the meanings of its words and the rules used to combine them. I explore unsupervised learning of word and sentence vectors using reconstruction errors. My my parsing work uses a simple linear scoring function and sentiment and relation classi cation use softmax classi ers to predict a label for each node and phrase in the tree. The standard RNN composition function is based on a single neural network layer that takes as input two phrase or word vectors and uses the same set of weights at every node in the parse tree to compute higher order phrase vectors. It is not expressive enough to capture all types of compositions. I explored several variants of composition functions. I have worked on constituency parsing, whose goal it is to learn the correct grammatical analysis of a sentence and produce a tree structure. Another approach allowed the actual task, such as sentiment prediction or reconstruction error, to determine the tree structure.

A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

abstract = {A text-To-speech synthesis system typically consists of multiple stages, such as a text analysis frontend, an acoustic model and an audio synthesis module. Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-Toend generative text-To-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given <text, audio> pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequenceto-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than samplelevel autoregressive methods.},

abstract = {Impressive image captioning results (i.e., an objective description for an image) are achieved with plenty of training pairs. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate the creation of narrative paragraph for a photo stream. This task is even more challenging due to the difficulty in modeling an ordered photo sequence and in generating a relevant paragraph with expressive language style for storytelling. The difficulty can even be exacerbated by the limited training data, so that existing approaches almost focus on search-based solutions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a sequence-to-sequence modeling approach with reinforcement learning and adversarial training. First, to model the ordered photo stream, we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network as story generator, which is optimized by reinforcement learning with rewards. Second, to generate relevant and story-style paragraphs, we design the rewards with two critic networks, including a multi-modal and a language-style discriminator. Third, we further consider the story generator and reward critics as adversaries. The generator aims to create indistinguishable paragraphs to human-level stories, whereas the critics aim at distinguishing them and further improving the generator by policy gradient. Experiments on three widely-used datasets show the effectiveness, against state-of-the-art methods with relative increase of 20.2% by METEOR. We also show the subjective preference for the proposed approach over the baselines through a user study with 30 human subjects.},

abstract = {Use of switching theory for system design is considered. An approach is taken in this paper which does not require an explicit use of the truth table. The design objective is the minimization of the average number of errors, rather than a minimization of the number of logical components used. The nature of the logical elements is quite unconventional. The system design procedure is adaptive, and is based upon an iterative search process. Performance feedback is used to achieve automatic system synthesis, i.e., the selection of the 'best' system from a restricted but useful class of possibilities. The designer 'trains' the system to give the correct responses by 'showing' it examples of inputs and respective desired outputs. The more examples 'seen', the better is the system performance.},

abstract = {Recently, Agile development processes have become popular in the software development community, and have been shown to be effective in large organizations. However, given that the communication and cooperation dynamics in startup companies are very different from that of larger, more established companies, and the fact that the initial focus of a startup might be significantly different from its ultimate goal, it is questionable whether a rigid process model that works for larger companies is appropriate in tackling the problems faced by a startup. When we scale down even further and observe the small scale startup with only a few members, many of the same problems that Agile methodology sets out to solve do not even exist. Then, for a small scale startup, is it still worth putting the resources into establishing a process model? Do the benefits of adopting an Agile methodology outweigh the opportunity cost of spending the resources elsewhere? This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an Agile methodology in a small scale tech startup and compares it to other process models, such as the Waterfall model and Lean Startup. In determining whether a rigorous agile methodology is the best development strategy for small scale tech startups, we consider the metrics of cost, time, quality, and scope in light of the particular needs of small startup organizations, and present a case study of a company that has needed to answer this very question.},

We show promising results compared to other methods on the MNIST digit classification task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed cluster environment.},
