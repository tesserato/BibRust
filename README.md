# Intro

The way bibliographic softwares treat .bib files is very annoying; they mess up with fields relentlessly. Despite that, they offer some very interesting capabilities, such as auto lookup. This is a way around that.

The idea of this script is to consolidate all the bibliographic data one has in .bib files spread around a folder, consolidate it in a unique file ready to be imported and treated in some of the available programs such as mendeley and zotero.
