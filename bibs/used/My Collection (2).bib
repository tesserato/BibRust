This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.

For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic background in algorithms. In this third edition, besides revisions to the second edition, new sections discussing Voronoi diagrams of line segments, farthest-point Voronoi diagrams, and realistic input models have been added. {\textcopyright} 2008, 2000, 1997 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@book{Olver1986,
abstract = {In 1964 the National Institute of Standards and Technology1 published the Handbook of Mathe- matical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables, edited by Milton Abramowitz and Irene A. Stegun. That 1046-page tome proved to be an invaluable reference for the many scien- tists and engineers who use the special functions of applied mathematics in their day-to-day work, so much so that it became the most widely distributed and most highly cited NIST publication in the first 100 years of the institution's existence.2 The success of the original handbook, widely referred to as “Abramowitz and Stegun” (“A&S”), derived not only from the fact that it provided critically useful scientific data in a highly accessible format, but also because it served to standardize definitions and notations for special functions. The provision of standard reference data of this type is a core function of NIST. Much has changed in the years since A&S was published. Certainly, advances in applied mathe- matics have continued unabated. However, we have also seen the birth of a new age of computing technology, which has not only changed how we utilize special functions, but also how we commu- nicate technical information. The document you are now holding, or the Web page you are now reading, represents an effort to extend the legacy of A&S well into the 21st century. The new printed volume, the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions, serves a similar function as the original A&S, though it is heavily updated and extended. The online version, the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF), presents the same technical information along with extensions and innovative interactive features consistent with the new medium. The DLMF may well serve as a model for the effective presentation of highly mathematical reference material on the Web. The production of these new resources has been a very complex undertaking some 10 years in the making. This could not have been done without the cooperation of many mathematicians, information technologists, and physical scientists both within NIST and externally. Their unfailing dedication is acknowledged deeply and gratefully. Particular attention is called to the generous support of the National Science Foundation, which made possible the participation of experts from academia and research institutes worldwide.},

It is considered common knowledge that RSS performs well if the transmitter is inside the convex hull of the sensor network, and poorly otherwise. However, this positioning rule of thumb is binary, vague, and not always accurate. In this letter, we consider the alpha shape, which is a generalization of the concept of a convex hull. We show that the alpha shape gives a more accurate estimate of localization performance than the convex hull, and we show how to use it to obtain a quasi-continuous and quantitative (rather than binary and qualitative) estimate of a sensor network's performance. We then compare this rule of thumb to more detailed, computationally intensive performance limits generated by the Cramer-Rao lower bound, with very good agreement. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {A key step for managing a large video database is to partition the video sequences into shots. Past approaches to this problem tend to confuse gradual shot changes with changes caused by smooth camera motions. This is in part due to the fact that camera motion has not been dealt with in a more fundamental way. We propose an approach that is based on a physical constraint used in optical flow analysis, namely, the total brightness of a scene point across two frames should remain constant if the change across two frames is a result of smooth camera motion. Since the brightness constraint would be violated across a shot change, the detection can be based on detecting the violation of this constraint. It is robust because it uses only the qualitative aspect of the brightness constraint - detecting a scene change rather than estimating the scene itself. Moreover, by tapping on the significant know-how in using this constraint, the algorithm's robustness is further enhanced. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of various algorithms. It was shown that our algorithm is less likely to interpret gradual camera motions as shot changes, resulting in a significantly better precision performance than most other algorithms.},

From the other side, in several games the best computer players use reinforcement learning. The chapter begins with a selection of games and notable reinforcement learning implementations.Without any modifications, the basic reinforcement learning algorithms are rarely sufficient for high-level gameplay, so it is essential to discuss the additional ideas, ways of inserting domain knowledge, implementation decisions that are necessary for scaling up. These are reviewed in sufficient detail to understand their potentials and their limitations. The second part of the chapter lists challenges for reinforcement learning in games, together with a review of proposed solution methods. While this listing has a game-centric viewpoint, and some of the items are specific to games (like opponent modelling), a large portion of this overview can provide insight for other kinds of applications, too. In the third part we review how reinforcement learning can be useful in game development and find its way into commercial computer games. Finally, we provide pointers for more in-depth reviews of specific games and solution approaches.},

abstract = {Simulation modeling and analysis is a powerful suite of techniques for addressing a broad array of decision analytical problems. In this chapter, we highlight the most important aspects of the topic, taking advantage of prior development of discrete and continuous stochastic models in this book. Beginning with discussing model building for simulation analysis relevant in various application areas, we review the fundamentals of simulation in terms of random variates generation, model validation, and simulation output analysis. We consider manufacturing and service systems, where we are concerned with the optimal layout and configuration of manufacturing operations or service delivery setup for best-performance characteristics, or sensitivity analysis from changes made in layout or changes appearing due to breakdowns. The second application domain we consider is that of communication and transportation networks, where flow of entities is on a fixed infrastructure designed to meet customer demand, while satisfying 'physical' constraints of the system. Therefore, capability analysis is often the motivation of evaluating such systems for meeting demand as well as quality of service delivered to customers. We finally consider two example application domains in banking and finance, one in asset valuation and allocation and the other in risk management. In the second part of the chapter, we delve into specialized topics of interest for a simulation study, such as variance reduction techniques, rare-event simulation, and stochastic Kriging. For a more sophisticated use of simulation modeling and analysis, we developmodeling approaches for simulation of dynamic systems. Acknowledging that many decision analytics problems extend to assessing better or the best configurations of systems or ways of performing tasks, the chapter presents simulation-based optimization methodologies and techniques to address optimal decision-making problems. While we have initiated the chapter with several specific application domains where simulation modeling and analysis is extensively utilized, the entire chapter is interspersed with examples for making a stronger context for an analyst to benefit from the topics covered. This chapter is devoted to developing simulation modeling and analysis concepts and techniques to address decision analysis problems. Simulation modeling and analysis is a vast topic, and a powerful suite of techniques, for solving a broad array of problems. This chapter will highlight in brevity the most important aspects of the topic. Taking advantage of prior discussions on discrete and continuous random variables and distributions, this chapter will begin with describing model building for simulation analysis of decision making. The next several major topics will develop the fundamentals of simulation modeling and analysis, through topics such as random variates generation, model validation, and simulation output analysis. This is followed by specialized topics on variance reduction techniques, rare-event simulation, stochastic Kriging, and simulation of dynamic systems for more sophisticated use of simulation modeling and analysis. The later part of this chapter focuses on simulation-based optimization methodologies and techniques to address optimal decision-making problems that may be solved using simulation in conjunction with optimization techniques. While the entire chapter is interspersed with examples, we initiate the chapter with several specific application domains where simulation modeling and analysis is extensively utilized. We will end the chapter by pointing to the future challenges facing simulation modeling and analysis for decision making today.},

abstract = {The pursuit of artificial intelligence has been a highly active domain of research for decades, yielding exciting scientific insights and productive new technologies. In terms of generating intelligence, however, this pursuit has yielded only limited success. This book explores the hypothesis that adaptive growth is a means of moving forward. By emulating the biological process of development, we can incorporate desirable characteristics of natural neural systems into engineered designs and thus move closer towards the creation of brain-like systems. The particular focus is on how to design artificial neural networks for engineering tasks. The book consists of contributions from 18 researchers, ranging from detailed reviews of recent domains by senior scientists, to exciting new contributions representing the state of the art in machine learning research. The book begins with broad overviews of artificial neurogenesis and bio-inspired machine learning, suitable both as an introduction to the domains and as a reference for experts. Several contributions provide perspectives and future hypotheses on recent highly successful trains of research, including deep learning, the Hyper NEAT model of developmental neural network design, and a simulation of the visual cortex. Other contributions cover recent advances in the design of bio-inspired artificial neural networks, including the creation of machines for classification, the behavioural control of virtual agents, the design of virtual multi-component robots and morphologies and the creation of flexible intelligence. Throughout, the contributors share their vast expertise on the means and benefits of creating brain-like machines. This book is appropriate for advanced students and practitioners of artificial intelligence and machine learning.},

It illustrates how to build a system network of neurons to perform spike-based information processing, computing, and high-level cognitive tasks. It is beneficial to a wide spectrum of readers, including undergraduate and postgraduate students and researchers who are interested in neuromorphic computing and neuromorphic engineering, as well as engineers and professionals in industry who are involved in the design and applications of neuromorphic cognitive systems, neuromorphic sensors and processors, and cognitive robotics. The book formulates a systematic framework, from the basic mathematical and computational methods in spike-based neural encoding, learning in both single and multi-layered networks, to a near cognitive level composed of memory and cognition. Since the mechanisms for integrating spiking neurons integrate to formulate cognitive functions as in the brain are little understood, studies of neuromorphic cognitive systems are urgently needed. The topics covered in this book range from the neuronal level to the system level. In the neuronal level, synaptic adaptation plays an important role in learning patterns. In order to perform higher-level cognitive functions such as recognition and memory, spiking neurons with learning abilities are consistently integrated, building a system with encoding, learning and memory functionalities.

@book{Kaishev2006,
abstract = {A new method for Computer Aided Geometric Design of variable knot regression splines, named GeDS, has recently been introduced by Kaishev et al. (2006). The method utilizes the close geometric relationship between a spline regression function and its control polygon, with vertices whose y-coordinates are the regression coefficients and whose x-coordinates are certain averages of the knots, known as the Greville sites. The method involves two stages, A and B. In stage A, a linear LS spline fit to the data is constructed, and viewed as the initial position of the control polygon of a higher order (n > 2) smooth spline curve. In stage B, the optimal set of knots of this higher order spline curve is found, so that its control polygon is as close to the initial polygon of stage A as possible, and finally the LS estimates of the regression coefficients of this curve are found. In Kaishev et al. (2006) the implementation of stage A has been thoroughly addressed and the pointwise asymptotic properties of the GeD spline estimator have been explored and used to construct asymptotic confidence intervals. In this paper, the focus of the attention is at giving further insight into the optimality properties of the knots of the higher order spline curve, obtained in stage B so that it is nearly a variation diminishing (shape preserving) spline approximation to the linear fit of stage A. Error bounds for this approximation are derived. Extensive numerical examples are provided, illustrating the performance of GeDS and the quality of the resulting LS spline fits. The GeDS estimator is compared with other existing variable knot spline methods and smoothing techniques and is shown to perform very well, producing nearly optimal spline regression models. It is fast and numerically efficient, since no deterministic or stochastic knot insertion/deletion and relocation search strategies are involved. Keywords:},

@article{Fischer2000,
abstract = {Assume we are given a set S ⊂ Rd of n points in 2D or 3D and we want to have something like “the shape formed by these points.” This is quite a vague notion and there are probably many possible interpretations (cf. [3]), the $\alpha$-shape being one of them. As mentionned in Edelsbrunner's and M¨ ucke's paper [3], one can intuitively think of an $\alpha$-shape as the following. Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space Rd and containing the points S as “hard” chocolate pieces. Using one of these sphere-formed ice-cream spoons we carve out all parts of the ice- cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (eg. parts not reachable by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and points. If we now straighten all “round” faces to triangles and line segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the $\alpha$-shape of S. Here's an example for this process in 2D (where our ice-cream spoon is simply a circle): And what is $\alpha$ in the game? $\alpha$ is the radius of the carving spoon. A very small value will allow us to eat up all of the ice-cream except the chocolate points S themselves. Thus we already see that the $\alpha$-shape of S degenerates to the point-set S for $\alpha$ → 0. On the other hand, a huge value of $\alpha$ will prevent us even from moving the spoon between two points since it's way too large. So we will never spoon up ice-cream lying in the inside of the convex hull of S, and hence the $\alpha$-shape for $\alpha$→∞ is the convex hull of S. In the following I will (i) summarize the definitons from [3] to state the above concepts (spoon, etc.) more precisely and (ii) present a result from [1] which allows one to easily compute $\alpha$-shapes from the Delaunay triangulation of S. Finally, I will very briefly give an overview of the problems and approaches with $\alpha$-shapes when applied to surface reconstruction. 2},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The main milestones of the historical development of neuroscience are introduced by pointing out the main discoveries over the decades. Highlights regarding the applications of molecular neuroscience research provide a basis to understand how the benchmark techniques can be translated to clinical practice. Important initiatives on computational and mathematical methods for neuroscience are presented, leading to simulations of neural function on different temporal and spatial scales. This overview could not be complete without an introductory part about cognition and behavior. Finally, some examples of neural treatment simulation are presented, giving hints about how one can understand the effects of light on biological neural tissue even before turning on the first laser or LED. This wide overview on theoretical neuroscience will contribute to a better understating of the variety and reach of knowledge to make the remainder of the book more comprehensible.},

The library, however, is not self-explanatory. To make full use of its components–and to benefit from their power–you need a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions. The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition, describes this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11). The book provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, including an introduction to its purpose and design; clearly written explanations of complex concepts; the practical programming details needed for effective use; traps and pitfalls; the exact signature and definition of the most important classes and functions; and numerous examples of working code. The book focuses in particular on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining containers, iterators, function objects, and STL algorithms. The book covers all the new C++11 library components, including Concurrency Fractional arithmetic Clocks and timers Tuples New STL containers New STL algorithms New smart pointers New locale facets Random numbers and distributions Type traits and utilities Regular expressions The book also examines the new C++ programming style and its effect on the standard library, including lambdas, range-based for loops, move semantics, and variadic templates.

In contrast, FC++ offers full and concise support for higher-order polymorphic functions through a novel use of C++ type inference. Another new element in FC++ is that it implements a subtype polymorphism policy for functions, in addition to the more common parametric polymorphism facilities. Subtype polymorphism is common in object oriented languages and ensures that functions in FC++ fit well within the C++ object model. Apart from these conceptual differences, FC++ is also an improvement in technical terms over previous efforts in the literature. Our function objects are reference-counted and can be aliased without needing to be copied, resulting in an efficient implementation. The reference-counting mechanism is also exported to the user as a general-purpose replacement of native C++ pointers. Finally, we supply a number of useful functional operators (a large part of the Haskell Standard Prelude) to facilitate programming with FC++. The end result is a library that is usable and efficient, while requiring no extensions to the base C++ language.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Historically left-handed people have had to cope with disparaging nicknames, sayings and misunderstanding about being left-handed. The age of hand dominance has been debated for decades with the consensus maintaining that at about 5 years old children begin to have stability in hand preference. In conjunction with hand dominance, the degree of dominance plays a significant role in the level of functioning. The impact of psychological well being during childhood is far reaching and could be life-long. Therefore, this study raised three hypotheses that could impact the future contact with students in regard to their hand preferences. Left-handed children would have significantly lower self-concept scores than right-handed children. Left-handed children would have higher anxiety levels. Left-handed children would use more external locus of control. Participants included 132 students from grades 4 through 6 from two Catholic Schools in the Wichita Diocese and one public elementary school in Reno County, Kansas. Of the 132 students 121 identified themselves as right-handed and 11 identified themselves as right-handed. To measure self-concept the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale was used. The Penn State Worry Questionnaire was used to measure anxiety. To measure locus of control the I-E Scale was used. Statistical results showed no statistically significant difference between left-handed and right-handed students in terms of anxiety and locus of control. Statistics revealed a statistically significant that left- handed students have a statistically significant higher self-concept.},

abstract = {Understanding the three-dimensional working envi- ronment is one of the most challenging tasks in robotics. Only by labeling perceived objects with semantics, a robot can reason about its environment, execute high-level plans and interact autonomously with it. A robot can perceive its enviroment by using 3D LIDAR systems, which generate 3D point cloud images of the environment. This data is perceived in a spatial domain, i.e. the raw data gives only positions of the measured points. The transfer from the spatial domain to the semantic domain is known as the gap problem in AI and one of the hardest to solve. In this paper we present an approach on how to extract spatial entities from unorganized point cloud data generated by a tilting laser scanner. Additionally, we describe how the extracted spatial entities can be mapped to entities in the semantic domain using feature descriptors. We also discuss, how a-priori knowledge about typical indoor environments can be used for semantic labeling.},

abstract = {In this first chapter we consider the following fundamental problem: Given a set of points in the plane, determine a smooth curve that approximates the points. The algorithm for determining the curve from the points should be well suited for implementation on a computer. That is, it should be efficient and it should not be overly sensitive to roundoff errors in the computations. We only consider methods that involve a relatively small number of elementary arithmetic operations; this ensures that the methods are efficient. The sensitivity of the methods to round-off errors is controlled by insisting that all the operations involved should amount to forming weighted averages of the given points. This has the added advantage that the constructions are geometrical in nature and easy to visualise. In Section 1.1 we discuss affine and convex combinations and the convex hull of a set of points, and relate these concepts to numerical stability (sensitivity to rounding errors), while in Section 1.2 we give a brief and very informal introduction to parametric curves. The first method for curve construction, namely polynomial interpolation, is introduced in Section 1.3. In Section 1.4 we show how to construct Bezier curves, and in Section 1.5 we generalise this construction to spline curves. At the outset, our construction of spline curves is geometrical in nature, but in Section 1.6 we show that spline curves can be written conveniently in terms of certain basis functions, namely B-splines. In the final section, we relate the material in this chapter to the rest of the book.},

abstract = {E investigate the role of nodes when a minimum dominating set (MDS) approach is considered in controlling a network. We present an algorithmic procedure to compute the critical and redundant nodes using the MDS. The theoretical analysis for scale-free networks shows that (1) high-degree nodes tend to be critical nodes and (2) for scaling exponent gamma>2, such probability increases when gamma grows. These relationships are confirmed by computer simulations. Furthermore, our computational experiments also show that the MDS is unimodal when the average degree left grows. It means that most nodes are redundant for high-degree, therefore one can achieve control through a small set of nodes, highlighting a centralized control feature. The analysis of a set of real-world networks confirms the findings observed in simulation experiments. In particular, the U.S. airport network shows a more centralized control, whereas the Italy's nationwide power grid network exhibits a more distributed control. The human protein-protein interaction network exerts control with a configuration between both man-made networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {www.editage.cn by ABSTRACT WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO WRITE AN EFFECTIVE TITLE? Internet statistics show that on an average, for every 500 individuals who read the title of a research paper, only one is likely to read the complete paper. One might wonder: Does the title of the paper have anything to do with these readership numbers? Old research, in the form of the work of peers or contemporaries, usually forms the basis for new research. While it is common to browse and shortlist relevant papers from a searchable database, researchers or students may also come across a relevant research topic either in the contents section of a journal or in the references list of a paper. One can therefore say that the title of a paper directly affects the impact or visibility of a work, or that it is one of the factors that can affect the readership of a journal. Although the impact of the results (or conclusion) is reason enough for a work to be read and further cited, the title of a research paper is equally important in generating reader interest and providing the right exposure or visibility.},

abstract = {Multiplicative noise (also known as speckle noise) models are central to the study of coherent imaging systems, such as synthetic aperture radar and sonar, and ultrasound and laser imaging. These models introduce two additional layers of difficulties with respect to the standard Gaussian additive noise scenario: 1) the noise is multiplied by (rather than added to) the original image; 2) the noise is not Gaussian, with Rayleigh and Gamma being commonly used densities. These two features of multiplicative noise models preclude the direct application of most state-of-the-art algorithms, which are designed for solving unconstrained optimization problems where the objective has two terms: a quadratic data term (log-likelihood), reflecting the additive and Gaussian nature of the noise, plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer (e.g., a total variation or wavelet-based regularizer/prior). In this paper, we address these difficulties by: 1) converting the multiplicative model into an additive one by taking logarithms, as proposed by some other authors; 2) using variable splitting to obtain an equivalent constrained problem; and 3) dealing with this optimization problem using the augmented Lagrangian framework. A set of experiments shows that the proposed method, which we name MIDAL (multiplicative image denoising by augmented Lagrangian), yields state-of-the-art results both in terms of speed and denoising performance. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Industrial design attempts to enhance quality of life by designing products that meet consumer requirements. Combining concepts from various fields, including design, computer technology, aesthetics, and economics, industrial designers seek to improve quality of life by designing products that meet consumer needs. Industrial designers focus on customers' perceptions of products and their preferences for certain shapes, textures, colors, styles, linguistic variables, prices, and functions. Because new products are continuously being released, manufacturers must continually design products to satisfy customer needs to avoid displacement by market competitors. When planning strategies for marketing products to various users and consumers, managers must often consider multiple combinations of product shapes and must design products that cater to consumer tastes to minimize the risk of their products being rejected by the market. Companies with highly-skilled designers have more ideas, better and more competitive products, and shorter production times than companies with weak designers. This study analyzed product styles by applying genetic algorithms and Kansei Engineering Type II (AHP and Quantification Theory Type I). This research transforms the psychological conceptions of consumers into linguistic variables. A MATLAB program was constructed to enable designers to simulate consumer logic. The cognitive dissonance between virtual and real models was minimized by using a 3D CAD model, and the virtual model of optimum solutions in this study employed a rapid prototyping machine to generate real models efficiently. Future genetic algorithm models applying different decision theories may achieve even faster and more accurate results. Relevance to industry: Component diversification enables rapid improvement in product competitiveness. This study proposes a support model that conforms to the psychological preferences of consumers by applying a genetic algorithm method. Therefore, the model is applicable to electronic commerce websites or to other unmanned shops. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging applications of time-frequency representations deals with the analysis of the signal issued from natural environment. Recently, the interest for passive underwater context increased, basically due to the rich information carried out by the natural signals. Taken into account the non-linear multi-component time-frequency behavior of such signals, their analysis is a complex problem. In this paper we introduce a new time-frequency analysis concept that aims to extract the non-linear time-frequency components. The main feature of this technique is the joint use of time-amplitude, time-frequency and time-phase information. This is materialized by a short-time polynomial phase modeling and the fusion of local information according to the best locally matches of local cubic frequency modulations. Tests provided on real data illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water repellency is very limited, despite their importance in determining soil hydrological response. Thus, repeat measurements of in situ surface and subsurface repellency and associated soil moisture content were made on eight occasions over a 16-month period at four sites in Eucalyptus globulus plantations of differing stand age (1-10 years) and burn history in north-central Portugal. Key findings are: (a) at all sites, large-scale seasonal variations in repellency occur, which, for the surface soils of the 10-year old site, encompass the transition from entirely wettable to entirely repellent within a period of ≤2 months; (b) when soils are either mostly wettable or mostly repellent, a close inverse relationship with antecedent rainfall and soil moisture exists; however, (c) at other times, no clear relationship between antecedent rainfall and soil moisture is apparent; and (d) the area of soil affected by repellency increases with stand age. The implications of these findings for slope hydrology are discussed.},

abstract = {Given a set of items with associated deterministic weights and random rewards, the adaptive stochastic knapsack problem (adaptive SKP) maximizes the probability of reaching a predetermined target reward level when items are inserted sequentially into a capacitated knapsack before the reward of each item is realized. This model arises in resource allocation problems that permit or require sequential allocation decisions in a probabilistic setting. One particular application is in obsolescence inventory management. In this paper, the adaptive SKP is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem for discrete random rewards. The paper also presents a heuristic that mixes adaptive and static policies to overcome the "curse of dimensionality" in the DP. The proposed heuristic is extended to problems with normally distributed random rewards. The heuristic can solve large problems quickly, and its solution always outperforms a static policy. The numerical study indicates that a near-optimal solution can be obtained by using an algorithm with limited look-ahead capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2011 INFORMS.},

Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm, when compared with several existing closed-form time-domain estimators, is closer to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).

This study examines the case of Serbia and applies multivariant statistical methods and specific artificial neural network architectures-the self-organizing map (SOM)-to assess the corporate financial health of various companies. Financial ratios drawn from corporate balance sheets become the independent variables in a multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). These financial ratios and the discriminant Z-score in the MDA form the input for the SOM, which creates a hybrid MDA-SOM model that is capable of predicting corporate financial insolvency. The experimental results of this research correctly estimate company financial health in 95% of cases. These are reliable predictions that are comparable with similar studies in other countries. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

Originally introduced by Sergei Natanovich Bernstein to facilitate a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, the leisurely convergence rate of Bernstein polynomial approximations to continuous functions caused them to languish in obscurity, pending the advent of digital computers. With the desire to exploit the power of computers for geometric design applications, however, the Bernstein form began to enjoy widespread use as a versatile means of intuitively constructing and manipulating geometric shapes, spurring further development of basic theory, simple and efficient recursive algorithms, recognition of its excellent numerical stability properties, and an increasing diversification of its repertoire of applications. This survey provides a brief historical perspective on the evolution of the Bernstein polynomial basis, and a synopsis of the current state of associated algorithms and applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The relationship between anatomic connectivity of large-scale brain networks and their functional connectivity is of immense importance and an area of active research. Previous attempts have required complex simulations which model the dynamics of each cortical region, and explore the coupling between regions as derived by anatomic connections. While much insight is gained from these non-linear simulations, they can be computationally taxing tools for predicting functional from anatomic connectivities. Little attention has been paid to linear models. Here we show that a properly designed linear model appears to be superior to previous non-linear approaches in capturing the brain's long-range second order correlation structure that governs the relationship between anatomic and functional connectivities. We derive a linear network of brain dynamics based on graph diffusion, whereby the diffusing quantity undergoes a random walk on a graph. We test our model using subjects who underwent diffusion MRI and resting state fMRI. The network diffusion model applied to the structural networks largely predicts the correlation structures derived from their fMRI data, to a greater extent than other approaches. The utility of the proposed approach is that it can routinely be used to infer functional correlation from anatomic connectivity. And since it is linear, anatomic connectivity can also be inferred from functional data. The success of our model confirms the linearity of ensemble average signals in the brain, and implies that their long-range correlation structure may percolate within the brain via purely mechanistic processes enacted on its structural connectivity pathways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Actually, banks are the dominant sector within Albanian financial system, managing more than 95.5% of total financial assets. Although banks sometimes use internal models as a substitute for credit ratings for their credit assessments, the internal models themselves often tend to rely heavily on ratings for actual or methodological input. Investors' reliance on credit ratings has increased over the past 30 years. Acquiring information is costly, particularly for fixed income investors, given collective action problems. Thus investors seek to outsource creditworthiness assessments to rating agencies. Finally we will see if there is a need of Banks Rating in Albanian's Banks, the requirements of Basel III and the regulatory of the Bank of Albania.},

The present work analyzes the potential for the improvement of the energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction for this sector up to 2030. Three scenarios are analyzed: baseline scenario (BS) representing the current evolution of this sector and two alternative scenarios (AS1 and AS2) to study the sensitivity of fuel and resource prices and CO2 emission prices. In the integrated production route all the scenarios highlight the importance of breakthrough technologies, such as Top Gas Recycling, to obtain performance improvement in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In the secondary production route conditions under BS scenario are enough for a suitable incorporation of the best technologies in this route making insensitive the possible incentives due to higher prices in fuel and resources or CO2 emissions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Software startups are more popular than ever and growing in numbers. They operate under conditions of extreme uncertainty and face many challenges. Often, agile development practices and lean principles are suggested as ways to increase the odds of succeeding as a startup, as they both advocate close customer collaboration and short feedback cycles focusing on delivering direct customer value. However, based on an interview study we see that despite guidance and support in terms of well-known and documented development methods, practitioners find it difficult to implement and apply these in practice. To explore this further, and to propose operational support for software startup companies, this study aims at investigating (1) what are the typical challenges when finding a product idea worth scaling, and (2) what solution would serve to address these challenges. To this end, we propose the ‘Early Stage Software Startup Development Model' (ESSSDM). The model extends already existing lean principles, but offers novel support for practitioners for investigating multiple product ideas in parallel, for determining when to move forward with a product idea, and for deciding when to abandon a product idea. The model was evaluated in a software startup project, as well as with industry professionals within the software startup domain.},

abstract = {Closed timelike curves are among the most controversial features of modern physics. As legitimate solutions to Einstein's field equations, they allow for time travel, which instinctively seems paradoxical. However, in the quantum regime these paradoxes can be resolved, leaving closed timelike curves consistent with relativity. The study of these systems therefore provides valuable insight into nonlinearities and the emergence of causal structures in quantum mechanics-essential for any formulation of a quantum theory of gravity. Here we experimentally simulate the nonlinear behaviour of a qubit interacting unitarily with an older version of itself, addressing some of the fascinating effects that arise in systems traversing a closed timelike curve. These include perfect discrimination of non-orthogonal states and, most intriguingly, the ability to distinguish nominally equivalent ways of preparing pure quantum states. Finally, we examine the dependence of these effects on the initial qubit state, the form of the unitary interaction and the influence of decoherence. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

@article{Graefe2014,
abstract = {When a working set fits into memory, the overhead imposed by the buffer pool renders traditional databases noncompetitive with in-memory designs that sacrifice the benefits of a buffer pool. However, despite the large memory available with modern hardware, data skew, shifting workloads, and complex mixed workloads make it diffcult to guarantee that a working set will fit in memory. Hence, some recent work has focused on enabling in-memory databases to protect performance when the working data set almost fits in memory. Contrary to those prior efforts, we enable buffer pool designs to match in-memory performance while supporting the "big data" workloads that continue to require secondary storage, thus providing the best of both worlds. We introduce here a novel buffer pool design that adapts pointer swizzling for references between system objects (as opposed to application objects), and uses it to practically eliminate buffer pool overheads for memoryresident data. Our implementation and experimental evaluation demonstrate that we achieve graceful performance degradation when the working set grows to exceed the buffer pool size, and graceful improvement when the working set shrinks towards and below the memory and buffer pool sizes. {\textcopyright} 2014 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract = {A basic problem in science is to fit a model to observa-tions subject to errors. It is clear that the more obser-vations that are available, the more accurately will it be possible to calculate the parameters in the model. This gives rise to the problem of " solving " an overdetermined linear or nonlinear system of equations. It can be shown that the solution which minimizes a weighted sum of the squares of the residual is optimal in a certain sense Ake Bj{\"{o}}rck, Numerical Methods for Least Squares Prob-lems, SIAM, 1996. Least squares problems appear very naturally when one would like to estimate values of parameters of a mathematical model from measured data, which are subject to errors (see quote above). They appear however also in other con-texts, and form an important subclass of more general optimization problems, see Chapter 12. After several typical examples of least squares problems, we start in Section 6.2 with the linear least squares problem and the natural solution given by the normal equations. There were two fundamental contri-butions to the numerical solution of linear least squares problems in the last century: the first one was the development of the QR factorization by Golub in 1965, and the second one was the implicit QR algorithm for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) by Golub and Reinsch (1970). We introduce the SVD, which is fundamental for the understanding of linear least squares problems, in Section 6.3. We postpone the description of the algorithm for its computation to Chapter 7, but use the SVD to study the condition of the linear least squares problem in Section 6.4. This will show why the normal equations are not necessarily a good approach for solving linear least squares problems, and motivates the use of orthogonal transfor-mations and the QR decomposition in Section 6.5. Like in optimization, least squares problems can also have constraints. We treat the linear least squares problem with linear constraints in full detail in Section 6.6, and a special class with nonlinear constraints in Section 6.7. We then turn to nonlinear least squares problems in Section 6.8, which have to be solved by iteration. We show classical iterative methods for such problems, and like in the case of nonlinear equations, linear least squares problems arise naturally at each iter-ation. We conclude this chapter with an interesting example of least squares fitting with piecewise functions in Section 6.9. The currently best and most thorough reference for least squares methods is the book b Ake Bj{\"{o}}rck [9].},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation and classification framework for sentence-level sentiment classification. It is widely recognized that phrasal information is crucial for sentiment classification. However, existing sentiment classification algorithms typically split a sentence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent sentiment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as {'not bad,' 'bad'} and {'a great deal of,' 'great'}. We address this issue by developing a joint framework for sentence-level sentiment classification. It simultaneously generates useful segmentations and predicts sentence-level polarity based on the segmentation results. Specifically, we develop a candidate generation model to produce segmentation candidates of a sentence; a segmentation ranking model to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classification; and a classification model for predicting the sentiment polarity of a segmentation. We train the joint framework directly from sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without using any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. We conduct experiments for sentiment classification on two benchmark datasets: a tweet dataset and a review dataset. Experimental results show that: 1) our method performs comparably with state-of-The-art methods on both datasets; 2) joint modeling segmentation and classification outperforms pipelined baseline methods in various experimental settings.},

The research is built upon daily CDS spreads of 40 international banks for the period from June 2007 to March 2010, i.e. at the heart of the global financial crisis. For this time period, 20 of the financial institutions received federal bailouts and are labeled as defaults while the remaining institutions are categorized as non-defaults. The employed multivariate pattern recognition approach represents a modification of the CORA3 algorithm. The approach is found to be robust regardless of reasonable changes of its inputs.

abstract = {Feature selection is used in many application areas relevant to expert and intelligent systems, such as data mining and machine learning, image processing, anomaly detection, bioinformatics and natural language processing. Feature selection based on information theory is a popular approach due its computational efficiency, scalability in terms of the dataset dimensionality, and independence from the classifier. Common drawbacks of this approach are the lack of information about the interaction between the features and the classifier, and the selection of redundant and irrelevant features. The latter is due to the limitations of the employed goal functions leading to overestimation of the feature significance. To address this problem, this article introduces two new nonlinear feature selection methods, namely Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) and Normalised Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (NJMIM); both these methods use mutual information and the 'maximum of the minimum' criterion, which alleviates the problem of overestimation of the feature significance as demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The proposed methods are compared using eleven publically available datasets with five competing methods. The results demonstrate that the JMIM method outperforms the other methods on most tested public datasets, reducing the relative average classification error by almost 6% in comparison to the next best performing method. The statistical significance of the results is confirmed by the ANOVA test. Moreover, this method produces the best trade-off between accuracy and stability.},

abstract = {How does a patent strategy affect a tech startup company's growth? This is a fundamental question for technology entrepreneurs, investors, lawyers and the innovation system as a whole. In this study, I shed light on this issue by conducting an empirical analysis of the patenting strategies of technology startups, examining the relationship between a company's patent applications and different events over the company's life: rounds of investment received, company acquisition and closure. I provide the first comprehensive cross-industry analysis of this question, by analyzing the patent portfolios of United States startups listed in CrunchBase, a crowd-sourced registry of tech companies used by the startup industry. By looking into these companies' public patent applications from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database between 2008 and 2012, I examine the patenting patterns of startups as they progress through funding rounds.  Through a quantitative analysis, I find that companies based in California tend to patent more than in other states, and that companies that are venture-backed patent more than those who are not. I also unveil that most start-ups that patent file their first application before even receiving any reported funding. Moreover, I find that there is a significant positive relationship between patent protection, and receiving investment and being acquired. I further find that the number of patents (and not merely the fact that a company has patents or not) contributes to higher total funding. I finally observe that patenting early is also associated to higher funding, and that early may be more important for start-ups than what some views in venture capital may predict. I also conclude that while more patents are associated with higher funding, patents account for a relevant but small portion of a company's success.  The study provides novel insights on startup patenting strategies. It lays empirical groundwork on key circumstances under which patents can contribute to a startup's growth, to provide important guidance to the legal and entrepreneurial communities. },

Traditionally, the focus of time-series classification has been on short time-series data composed of a few patterns exhibiting variabilities, while recently there have been attempts to focus on longer series composed of multiple local patrepeating with an arbitrary irregularity. The primary contribution of this paper relies on presenting a method which can detect local patterns in repetitive time-series via fitting local polynomial functions of a specified degree. We capture the repetitiveness degrees of time-series datasets via a new measure. Furthermore, our method approximates local polynomials in linear time and ensures an overall linear running time complexity. The coefficients of the polynomial functions are converted to symbolic words via equi-area discretizations of the coefficients' distributions. The symbolic polynomial words enable the detection of similar local patterns by assigning the same word to similar polynomials. Moreover, a histogram of the frequencies of the words is constructed from each time-series' bag of words. Each row of the histogram enables a new representation for the series and symbolizes the occurrence of local patterns and their frequencies. In an experimental comparison against state-of-the-art baselines on repetitive datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvements in terms of prediction accuracy.},

There is a finite set of users with demand of service and a finite set of potential locations for the facilities that will offer service to users. Two types of decisions must be made: Location decisions determine where to establish the facilities whereas allocation decisions dictate how to satisfy the users demand from the established facilities. Potential applications of various types arise in many different contexts. We provide an overview of the main elements that may intervene in the modeling and the solution process of Fixed-Charge Facility Location Problems, namely, modeling hypotheses and their implications, characteristics of formulations and their relation to other formulations, properties of the domains, and appropriate solution techniques.},

abstract = {Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. This problem is clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied on significant user interaction or resulted in desaturated colorizations. We propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a “colorization Turing test,” asking human participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools humans on 32% of the trials, significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover, we show that colorization can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature learning, acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on several feature learning benchmarks.},

abstract = {We introduce a parametric nonlinear transformation that is well-suited for Gaussianizing data from natural images. The data are linearly transformed, and each component is then normalized by a pooled activity measure, computed by ex-ponentiating a weighted sum of rectified and exponentiated components and a constant. We optimize the parameters of the full transformation (linear transform, exponents, weights, constant) over a database of natural images, directly minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The optimized transformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantly smaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative methods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is differentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a density model on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to samples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as a prior probability density that can be used to remove additive noise. Finally, we show that the transformation can be cascaded, with each layer optimized using the same Gaussianization objective, thus offering an unsupervised method of optimizing a deep network architecture.},

In this paper we present a singing synthesizer that using two rather small databases is able to generate expressive synthesis from an input consisting of notes and lyrics. The system is based on unit selection and uses the Wide-Band Harmonic Sinusoidal Model for transforming samples. The first database focuses on expression and consists of less than 2 minutes of free expressive singing using solely vowels. The second one is the timbre database which for the English case consists of roughly 35 minutes of monotonic singing of a set of sentences, one syllable per beat. The synthesis is divided in two steps. First, an expressive vowel singing performance of the target song is generated using the expression database. Next, this performance is used as input control of the synthesis using the timbre database and the target lyrics. A selection of synthetic performances have been submitted to the Interspeech Singing Synthesis Challenge 2016, in which they are compared to other competing systems.},

We first learn several kernel principal components of occlusion variations as an occlusion model, which can represent the possible occlusion variations efficiently. Then, the occlusion model is projected by KDA to get the KED, which can be computed via the same kernel trick as new testing samples. Finally, we use structured SRC for classification, which is fast as only a small number of atoms are appended to the basic dictionary, and the feature dimension is low. We also extend KED to multikernel space to fuse different types of features at kernel level. Experiments are done on several large-scale data sets, demonstrating that not only does KED get impressive results for nonoccluded samples, but it also handles the occlusion well without overfitting, even with a single gallery sample per subject.},

Here, we demonstrate that pseudouridylation (conversion of uridine into pseudouridine (Psi), ref. 4) of nonsense codons suppresses translation termination both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo targeting of nonsense codons is accomplished by the expression of an H/ACA RNA capable of directing the isomerization of uridine to Psi within the nonsense codon. Thus, targeted pseudouridylation represents a novel approach for promoting nonsense suppression in vivo. Remarkably, we also show that pseudouridylated nonsense codons code for amino acids with similar properties. Specifically, Psi AA and Psi AG code for serine and threonine, whereas Psi GA codes for tyrosine and phenylalanine, thus suggesting a new mode of decoding. Our results also suggest that RNA modification, as a naturally occurring mechanism, may offer a new way to expand the genetic code.},

We consider different types of short-correlated multiplicative and additive noise sources and compare the time-dependent PDFs in the two models, elucidating the effects of the additive and multiplicative noises on the form of PDFs. We demonstrate an interesting transition from a unimodal to a bimodal PDF as the multiplicative noise increases for a fixed value of the additive noise. A much weaker (leaky) attractor in the Gompertz model leads to a significant (singular) growth of the population of a very small size. We point out the limitation of using stationary PDFs, mean value and variance in understanding statistical properties of the growth in non-stationary states, highlighting the importance of time-dependent PDFs. We further compare these two models from the perspective of information change that occurs during the growth process. Specifically, we define an infinitesimal distance at any time by comparing two PDFs at times infinitesimally apart and sum these distances in time. The total distance along the trajectory quantifies the total number of different states that the system undergoes in time, and is called the information length. We show that the time-evolution of the two models become more similar when measured in units of the information length and point out the merit of using the information length in unifying and understanding the dynamic evolution of different growth processes.},

abstract = {A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or an object part. We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

The tuned filter characteristics of MWDFT is modified into more flat characteristic around the center frequency with negative feedback, which increases the bandwidth of the filter. An adaptive sampling pulse adjustment mechanism is incorporated in the proposed structure for online estimation of frequency. Hence, the frequency error was exploited to achieve synchronization between in-phase component of MWDFT and input signal of estimation. The amplitude is estimated in online from the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of MWDFT. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the existing techniques and experimentally validated on single-link flexible manipulator system for the online estimation of frequency and amplitude of tip deflection signal.

This paper investigates the analogous problem in the audio domain: How to transfer the style of a reference audio signal to a target audio content? We propose a flexible framework for the task, which uses a sound texture model to extract statistics characterizing the reference audio style, followed by an optimization-based audio texture synthesis to modify the target content. In contrast to mainstream optimization-based visual transfer method, the proposed process is initialized by the target content instead of random noise and the optimized loss is only about texture, not structure. These differences proved key for audio style transfer in our experiments. In order to extract features of interest, we investigate different architectures, whether pre-trained on other tasks, as done in image style transfer, or engineered based on the human auditory system. Experimental results on different types of audio signal confirm the potential of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Recent evidence challenges the widely held view that the hippocampus is specialized for episodic memory, by demonstrating that it also underpins the integration of information across experiences. Contemporary computational theories propose that these two contrasting functions can be accomplished by big-loop recurrence, whereby the output of the system is recirculated back into the hippocampus. We use ultra-high-resolution fMRI to provide support for this hypothesis, by showing that retrieved information is presented as a new input on the superficial entorhinal cortex—driven by functional connectivity between the deep and superficial entorhinal layers. Further, the magnitude of this laminar connectivity correlated with inferential performance, demonstrating its importance for behavior. Our findings offer a novel perspective on information processing within the hippocampus and support a unifying framework in which the hippocampus captures higher-order structure across experiences, by creating a dynamic memory space from separate episodic codes for individual experiences. The hippocampus is central for storing distinct episodes, while also supporting integration across related episodes. Using ultra-high-resolution fMRI, Koster et al. provide evidence for a core computational principle (big-loop recurrence) that can account for these apparently conflicting hippocampal roles.},

Whereas the early jet engines barely lasted for less than 10 hours, today's civil engines can stay on wings for up to 10,000 hours, and high-performance military engines can last several hundred hours. Advances in blade cooling technologies and high-temperature materials have permitted an increase in turbine inlet temperature from 1280 to 3200°F. Today, engine thermal efficiency is approaching 50%. Also, today's most powerful aeroengines already meet the International Civil Aviation Organization ultra-low gaseous and smoke requirements. Finally, civil and military technology is moving along the direction set by the versatile affordable advanced turbine engines (VAATE) propulsion capability goals.

abstract = {In today's data-driven economy, operators that integrate vast stores of fundamental reservoir and production data with the high-performance predictive analytics solutions can emerge as winners in the contest of maximizing estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The scope of this study is to demonstrate a new workflow coupling earth sciences with data analytics to operationalize well completion optimization. The workflow aims to build a robust predictive model that allows users to perform sensitivity analysis on completion designs within a few hours. Current workflows for well completion and production optimization in unconventional reservoirs require extensive earth modeling, fracture simulation, and production simulations. With considerable effort and wide scale of sensitivity, studies could enable optimized well completion design parameters such as optimal cluster spacing, optimal proppant loading, optimal well spacing, etc. Yet, today, less than 5% of the wells fractured in North America are designed using advanced simulation due to the required level of data, skillset, and long computing times. Breaking these limitations through parallel fracture and reservoir simulations in the cloud and combining such simulation with data analytics and artificial intelligence algorithms helped in the development of a powerful solution that creates models for fast, yet effective, completion design. As a case study, the approach was executed on Eagle Ford wells. Over 2000 data points were collected with completion sensitivity performed on a multithreaded cluster environment on these wells. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms of data analytics such as random forest, gradient boost, linear regression, etc. were applied on the data points to create a proxy model for the fracturing and numerical production simulator. With the gradient boost technique, over 90% accuracy was achieved between the proxy model and the actual results. Hence, the proxy model could predict the wellbore productivity accurately for any given change in completion design. The operators now had a much simpler model, which served as a plug-and-play tool for the completion engineers to evaluate the impact of changes in completion parameters on the future well performance and making fast-tracked economic decisions almost in real time. The approach can be replicated for varying geological and geomechanical properties as operations move from pad to pad. Although the need for heavy computing resource, simulation skillset, and long run times was eliminated with this new approach, regular QA/QC of the model through manual simulations makes the process more robust and reliable. The methodology provides an integrated approach to bridge the traditional reservoir understanding and simulation approach to the new big data approach to create proxies, which allows operators to make quicker decisions for completion optimization. The technique presented in this paper can be extended for other domains of wellsite operations such as well drilling, artificial lift, etc. and help operators evaluate the most economical scenario in close to real time.},

In many applications, e.g. learning with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where ADAM does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of ADAM algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with "long-term memory" of past gradients, and propose new variants of the ADAM algorithm which not only fix the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.},

abstract = {Estimating the relative importance of vertices and edges is a fundamental issue in the analysis of complex networks, and has found vast applications in various aspects, such as social networks, power grids, and biological networks. Most previous work focuses on metrics of vertex importance and methods for identifying powerful vertices, while related work for edges is much lesser, especially for weighted networks, due to the computational challenge. In this paper, we propose to use the well-known Kirchhoff index as the measure of edge centrality in weighted networks, called $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality. The Kirchhoff index of a network is defined as the sum of effective resistances over all vertex pairs. The centrality of an edge e is reected in the increase of Kirchhoff index of the network when the edge e is partially deactivated, characterized by a parameter $\theta$. We define two equivalent measures for $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality. Both are global metrics and have a better discriminating power than commonly used measures, based on local or partial structural information of networks, e.g. edge betweenness and spanning edge centrality. Despite the strong advantages of Kirchhoff index as a centrality measure and its wide applications, computing the exact value of Kirchhoff edge centrality for each edge in a graph is computationally demanding. To solve this problem, for each of the $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality metrics, we present an efficient algorithm to compute its $\theta$-approximation for all the m edges in nearly linear time in m. The proposed $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality is the first global metric of edge importance that can be provably approximated in nearly-linear time. Moreover, according to the $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality, we present a $\theta$-Kirchhoff vertex centrality measure, as well as a fast algorithm that can compute $\theta$-approximate Kirchhoff vertex centrality for all the n vertices in nearly linear time in m.},

Specifically, we show how an asymmetric bimatrix game (A,B) can be decomposed into its symmetric counterparts by envisioning and investigating the payoff tables (A and B) that constitute the asymmetric game, as two independent, single population, symmetric games. We reveal several surprising formal relationships between an asymmetric two-population game and its symmetric single population counterparts, which facilitate a convenient analysis of the original asymmetric game due to the dimensionality reduction of the decomposition. The main finding reveals that if (x,y) is a Nash equilibrium of an asymmetric game (A,B), this implies that y is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table A, and x is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric counterpart game determined by payoff table B. Also the reverse holds and combinations of Nash equilibria of the counterpart games form Nash equilibria of the asymmetric game. We illustrate how these formal relationships aid in identifying and analysing the Nash structure of asymmetric games, by examining the evolutionary dynamics of the simpler counterpart games in several canonical examples.},

Often, it is computationally intractable to resolve the finest features in the solution. The only recourse is to use approximate coarse-grained representations, which aim to accurately represent long-wavelength dynamics while properly accounting for unresolved small-scale physics. Deriving such coarse-grained equations is notoriously difficult and often ad hoc. Here we introduce data-driven discretization, a method for learning optimized approximations to PDEs based on actual solutions to the known underlying equations. Our approach uses neural networks to estimate spatial derivatives, which are optimized end to end to best satisfy the equations on a low-resolution grid. The resulting numerical methods are remarkably accurate, allowing us to integrate in time a collection of nonlinear equations in 1 spatial dimension at resolutions 4× to 8× coarser than is possible with standard finite-difference methods.},

Geometrically nonlinear vibrations of thin plates and shells with variable thickness are investigated numerically with the purpose of synthesizing the sound of cymbals. In cymbal making, taper refers to the gradual change in thickness from the centre to the rim and is known to be a key feature that determines the tone of the instrument. It is generally used in conjunction with shape variations in order to enable the cymbal to play a bell-like sound when hit near its centre, or a crash sound when struck close to the edge. The von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n equations for thin plates with thickness and shape variations are derived, and a numerical method combining a Rayleigh-Ritz approach together with a St{\"{o}}rmer-Verlet scheme for advancing the problem in time is detailed. One main advantage of the method is its ability to implement easily any frequency-dependent loss mechanism which is a key property for sound synthesis. Also, the accuracy of the computation of the nonlinear restoring force is especially preserved. The method is employed to synthesize the sounds of cymbal-like instruments. The impact of taper is addressed and the relative effects of both thickness and shape variations, are contrasted.},

To edit a video, the user has to only edit the transcript, and an optimization strategy then chooses segments of the input corpus as base material. The annotated parameters corresponding to the selected segments are seamlessly stitched together and used to produce an intermediate video representation in which the lower half of the face is rendered with a parametric face model. Finally, a recurrent video generation network transforms this representation to a photorealistic video that matches the edited transcript. We demonstrate a large variety of edits, such as the addition, removal, and alteration of words, as well as convincing language translation and full sentence synthesis.},

abstract = {Envelopes, which represent the overall information of the signal amplitude variation, are the necessary mediums in many signal decomposition methods. The phenomena of undershoot and overshoot result in the error of envelope estimation and unexpected signal decomposition components. In this paper, an accurate envelope estimation method, called the empirical optimal envelope (EOE), is proposed and applied to the local mean decomposition (LMD). First, an indicator of envelope distance is defined to describe the features of the ideal envelope. Utilizing the indicator, an iterative algorithm for the approximation of tangency points is designed. The tangency points, instead of the extreme points, are interpolated to realize the EOE. Then, the EOE is integrated with the LMD, and two interpolation functions, the cubic spline and the piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial, are combined to improve the efficiency and convergence of signal decomposition. Finally, the proposed method is verified by simulated signals and actual signals.},

The model generates novel image sequences of that person, according to arbitrary user-defined control signals, typically marking the displacement of the moving body. The generated video can have an arbitrary background, and effectively capture both the dynamics and appearance of the person. The method is based on two networks. The first network maps a current pose, and a single-instance control signal to the next pose. The second network maps the current pose, the new pose, and a given background, to an output frame. Both networks include multiple novelties that enable high-quality performance. This is demonstrated on multiple characters extracted from various videos of dancers and athletes.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

In the first step, the SWDFT sequence in frequency-domain varied with time instant is obtained by performing the SWDFT on the input signal, where the coarse frequency is estimated. It has been proved that the SWDFT of a multi-frequency signal possesses the same linear relationship as the original time-domain signal and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each frequency component is enhanced by the SWDFT. In the second step, the parameters are estimated with high accuracy by a linear prediction from the SWDFT sequence, where the complex-valued least squares (CLS) framework is used. Computer simulation and practical measurement results show that the proposed algorithm can estimate parameters of a multi-frequency signal distorted by noise with high accuracy.},

However, our knowledge of active dendrites has been almost entirely acquired from studies of rodents. In this work, we investigated the dendrites of layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the human cerebral cortex ex vivo. In these neurons, we discovered a class of calcium-mediated dendritic action potentials (dCaAPs) whose waveform and effects on neuronal output have not been previously described. In contrast to typical all-or-none action potentials, dCaAPs were graded; their amplitudes were maximal for threshold-level stimuli but dampened for stronger stimuli. These dCaAPs enabled the dendrites of individual human neocortical pyramidal neurons to classify linearly nonseparable inputs-a computation conventionally thought to require multilayered networks.},

In this work, we propose a structural probe, which evaluates whether syntax trees are embedded in a linear transformation of a neural network's word representation space. The probe identifies a linear transformation under which squared L2 distance encodes the distance between words in the parse tree, and one in which squared L2 norm encodes depth in the parse tree. Using our probe, we show that such transformations exist for both ELMo and BERT but not in baselines, providing evidence that entire syntax trees are embedded implicitly in deep models' vector geometry.},

abstract = {The effective potential formalism of Rabitz is extended to a general potential expressed in terms of relative or body-fixed coordinates and applied to the study of the H2-HD rotationally inelastic collisions. The H, and HD molecules are treated as rigid rotors and their interaction potential is derived from the H2-H2 potential. Long-range quadrupole-dipole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions are also considered. Quantum-mechanical close-coupling calculations for three-dimensional collisions of para-H2, and ortho-H2 with HD are performed up to E=0.20 eV. The general features of the rotational excitation cross sections of HD are examined and their sensitivity to certain aspects of the potential are analyzed. In particular, the different roles of the short- and long-range anisotropies are illustrated. It is found that the degree of anisotropy is meaningful only in relation to the magnitude of the "effectively" spherically symmetric part of potential. The rate constants for pure rotational transitions of HD are presented in the temperature range of 5 to 800 °K. The relation of these results to the quantitative interpretation of the thermal balance of interstellar clouds is pointed out. We have also calculated the rotational relaxation times for the lowest two levels of HD, which could be examined and compared with future sound absorption experiments to assess the accuracy of the H2-HD interaction potential.

Such problems arise, for example, in the analysis of multicomponent radioactive decay curves, and in the study of the dielectric properties of certain compounds. This paper is concerned with the numerical evaluation of a mathematical approach to the problem. The approach is based on the inversion of the Laplace integral equation by a method of Fourier transforms. The results of the analysis appear in the form of a frequency spectrum. Each true peak in the spectrum indicates a component, the abscissa value at the center of the peak is the decay constant X,-, while the height of the peak is directly proportional to Ni/$\lambda$t. Results obtained on an IBM 650 computer indicate that the method may possess certain advantages over previous methods of analysis.},

abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

Each expansion coefficient Bp is defined as the inner product sp(t) and hp(t), where sp(t) is the remainder of the orthogonal projection of sp-1(t) onto hp-1(t). Consequently, the AGR not only accurately captures signal local behavior, but also has a monotonically decreasing reconstruction error {norm of matrix}sp(t){norm of matrix}2. By combining the AGR and the Wigner-Ville distribution, we further develop an adaptive spectrogram that is non-negative, cross-term free, and of high resolution.

@article{Smith1999,
abstract = {Use of a bilinear conformai map to achieve a frequency warping nearly identical to that of the Bark frequency scale is described. Because the map takes the unit circle to itself, its form is that of the transfer function of a first-order allpass filter. Since it is a first-order map, it preserves the model order of rational systems, making it a valuable frequency warping technique for use in audio filter design. A closed-form weighted-equationor method is derived that computes the optimal mapping coefficient as a function of sampling rate, and the solution is shown to be generally indistinguishable from the optimal least-squares solution. The optimal Chebyshev mapping is also found to be essentially identical to the optimal least-squares solution. The expression 0.8517 [arctan(0.06583fs)]1/2-0.916 is shown to accurately approximate the optimal allpass coefficient as a function of sampling rate fs in kHz for sampling rates greater than 1 kHz. A filter design example is included that illustrates improvements due to carrying out the design over a Bark scale. Corresponding results are also given and compared for approximating the related "equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) scale≤ of Moore and Glasberg using a first-order allpass transformation. Due to the higher frequency resolution called for by the ERB scale, particularly at low frequencies, the first-order conformal map is less able to follow the desired mapping, and the error is two to three times greater than the Bark-scale case, depending on the sampling rate. {\textcopyright} 1999 IEEE Publisher Item Identifier S 1063-6676(99)07979-1.},

abstract = {We propose a best basis algorithm for signal enhancement in white Gaussian noise. The best basis search is performed in families of orthonormal bases constructed with wavelet packets or local cosine bases. We base our search for the `best' basis on a criterion of minimal reconstruction error of the underlying signal. This approach is intuitively appealing because the enhanced or estimated signal has an associated measure of performance, namely, the resulting mean-square error. Previous approaches in this framework have focused on obtaining the most `compact' signal representations, which consequently contribute to effective denoising. These approaches, however, do not possess the inherent measure of performance which our algorithm provides. We first propose an estimator of the mean-square error, based on a heuristic argument and subsequently compare the reconstruction performance based upon it to that based on the Stein unbiased risk estimator. We compare the two proposed estimators by providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bias term. Having two estimators of the mean-square error, we incorporate these cost functions into the search for the `best' basis, and subsequently provide a substantiating example to demonstrate their performance.},

We first study ways to control the capacity of Perceptrons (mainly regularization parameters and early stopping), using the margin idea introduced with SVMs. After showing that under simple conditions a Perceptron is equivalent to an SVM, we show it can be computationally expensive in time to train an SVM (and thus a Perceptron) with stochastic gradient descent, mainly because of the margin maximization term in the cost function. We then show that if we remove this margin maximization term, the learning rate or the use of early stopping can still control the margin. These ideas are extended afterward to the case of MLPs. Moreover, under some assumptions it also appears that MLPs are a kind of mixture of SVMs, maximizing the margin in the hidden layer space. Finally, we present a very simple MLP based on the previous findings, which yields better performances in generalization and speed than the other models.},

abstract = { {\S}1. Introduction . Our understanding of Nature comes in layers, so should the development of logic. Classic logic is an indispensable part of our knowledge, and its interactions with computer science have recently dramatically changed our life. A new layer of logic has been developing ever since the discovery of quantum mechanics. G. D. Birkhoff and von Neumann introduced quantum logic in a seminal paper in 1936 [1]. But the definition of quantum logic varies among authors (see [2]). How to capture the logic structure inherent in quantum mechanics is very interesting and challenging. Given the close connection between classical logic and theoretical computer science as exemplified by the coincidence of computable functions through Turing machines, recursive function theory, and $\lambda$-calculus, we are interested in how to gain some insights about quantum logic from quantum computing. In this note we make some observations about quantum logic as motivated by quantum computing (see [5]) and hope more people will explore this connection.  The quantum logic as envisioned by Birkhoff and von Neumann is based on the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space, usually an infinite dimensional one. The quantum logic of a fixed Hilbert space ℍ in this note is the variety of all the true equations with finitely many variables using the connectives meet, join and negation. Quantum computing is theoretically based on quantum systems with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, especially the states space of a qubit ℂ 2 . (Actually the qubit is merely a convenience. },

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

Both redox sensors showed reproducible sensitivity towards H2O2 in the lower micromolar range in vitro and in the parasites. Due to the pH sensitivity of HyPer-3, we used parasites expressing roGFP2-Orp1 for evaluation of short-, medium-, and long-term effects of antimalarial drugs on H2O2 levels and detoxification in Plasmodium. None of the quinolines or artemisinins tested had detectable direct effects on the H2O2 homeostasis at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. However, pre-treatment of the cells with antimalarial drugs or heat shock led to a higher tolerance towards exogenous H2O2. The systematic evaluation and comparison of the two genetically encoded cytosolic H2O2 probes in malaria parasites provides a basis for studying parasite-host cell interactions or drug effects with spatio-temporal resolution while preserving cell integrity.},

abstract = {Single neuron models are typical functional replica of the biological neuron that are derived using their individual and group responses in networks. In recent past, a lot of work in this area has produced advanced neuron models for both analog and binary data patterns. Popular among these are the higher-order neurons, fuzzy neurons and other polynomial neurons. In this paper, we propose a new neuron model based on a polynomial architecture. Instead of considering all the higher-order terms, a simple aggregation function is used. The aggregation function is considered as a product of linear functions in different dimensions of the space. The functional mapping capability of the proposed neuron model is demonstrated through some well known time series prediction problems and is compared with the standard multilayer neural network. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To accommodate the variety of data generated by nonlinear and nonstationary processes in nature, the analysis method would have to be adaptive. Hilbert-Huang transform, consisting of empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert spectral analysis, is a newly developed adaptive data analysis method, which has been used extensively in geophysical research. In this review, we will briefly introduce the method, list some recent developments, demonstrate the usefulness of the method, summarize some applications in various geophysical research areas, and finally, discuss the outstanding open problems. We hope this review will serve as an introduction of the method for those new to the concepts, as well as a summary of the present frontiers of its applications for experienced research scientists.},

In this paper, the relationships among the product image, color area, and aesthetic measurement of the product are studied. The pixels of an area of color are used to obtain the proportionate relationship between different colored areas in a given solid visual angle. Based on the relationship among the Hue, Value, Chroma and colored area proposed by Munsell, the other factors are integrated to set up one formula for evaluating the aesthetic degree of color matching. The aesthetics measurement is considered to be influenced by the color environments, color areas, component colors and display angles of the product. The color planning for developing a cell phone was performed based on this model. The experimental results verified this model can be used for color planning in product design. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate product form design in terms of the perspectives of Gestalt psychology and Minimalist principles. Unlike traditional AHP methods, the proposed decision-making model uses distinct mathematical tools to establish priorities for the criteria and synthesize the evaluation results. A case study was conducted to illustrate the practicability of this proposed model. It has shown a credible result. In addition to product form design, this model can be applied to related design fields, such as plane design and other visual design. Relevance to industry: Product form design is a creative process that involves complex visual perceptions. It is very important to develop an effective decision support system for designers to deal with problems concerning the consumers' psychological preferences toward product forms. As Gestalt psychology and Minimalist principles provide an important perspective on visual perception, it is appropriate to apply these principles in assessing the quality of product form design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A new approach to computer music instruments is described. Rather than sense control parameters from acoustic instruments (or non-acoustic instrument controllers), the sound of an acoustic instrument is used directly by a synthesis algorithm, usually replacing an oscillator. Parameters such as amplitude and pitch can control other aspects of the synthesis. This approach gives the player more control over details of the sound due to the use of the rich acoustic signal. Latency in sensing parameters, particularly pitch, is less of a problem because pitch information is carried directly by the acoustically generated signal. Several examples are described and the results of a subjective evaluation by musicians are presented.},

abstract = {Image classification has become one of the main tasks in the field of computer vision technologies. In this context, a recent algorithm called CapsNet that implements an approach based on activity vectors and dynamic routing between capsules may overcome some of the limitations of the current state of the art artificial neural networks (ANN) classifiers, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the CapsNet algorithm in comparison with three well-known classifiers (Fisherfaces, LeNet, and ResNet). We tested the classification accuracy on four datasets with a different number of instances and classes, including images of faces, traffic signs, and everyday objects. The evaluation results show that even for simple architectures, training the CapsNet algorithm requires significant computational resources and its classification performance falls below the average accuracy values of the other three classifiers. However, we argue that CapsNet seems to be a promising new technique for image classification, and further experiments using more robust computation resources and refined CapsNet architectures may produce better outcomes.},

abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks are showing much promise in many sub-areas of natural language processing, ranging from document classification to machine translation to automatic question answering. Despite their promise, many recurrent models have to read the whole text word by word, making it slow to handle long documents. For example, it is difficult to use a recurrent network to read a book and answer questions about it. In this paper, we present an approach of reading text while skipping irrelevant information if needed. The underlying model is a recurrent network that learns how far to jump after reading a few words of the input text. We employ a standard policy gradient method to train the model to make discrete jumping decisions. In our benchmarks on four different tasks, including number prediction, sentiment analysis, news article classification and automatic Q&A, our proposed model, a modified LSTM with jumping, is up to 6 times faster than the standard sequential LSTM, while maintaining the same or even better accuracy.},

As with any rapidly growing field, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date or enter the field as a beginner. While several topic specific survey papers have been written, to date no general survey on problems, datasets and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles exists. This paper attempts to narrow this gap by providing a state-of-the-art survey on this topic. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state-of-the-art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding and end-to-end learning. Towards this goal, we first provide a taxonomy to classify each approach and then analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarking datasets including KITTI, ISPRS, MOT and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we will also provide an interactive platform which allows to navigate topics and methods, and provides additional information and project links for each paper.},

abstract = {We consider a stochastic variant of the NP-hard 0/1 knapsack problem, in which item values are deterministic and item sizes are independent random variables with known, arbitrary distributions. Items are placed in the knapsack sequentially, and the act of placing an item in the knapsack instantiates its size. Our goal is to compute a solution "policy" that maximizes the expected value of items successfully placed in the knapsack, where the final overflowing item, contributes no value. We consider both nonadaptive policies (that designate a priori a fixed sequence of items to insert) and adaptive policies (that can make dynamic choices based on the instantiated sizes of items placed in the knapsack thus far). An important facet of our work lies in characterizing the benefit of adaptivity. For this purpose we advocate the use of a measure called the adaptivity gap: the ratio of the expected value obtained by an optimal adaptive policy to that obtained by an optimal nonadaptive policy. We bound the adaptivity gap of the stochastic knapsack problem by demonstrating a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a nonadaptive policy whose expected value approximates that of an optimal adaptive policy to within a factor of four. We also devise a polynomial-time adaptive policy that approximates the optimal adaptive policy to within a factor of 3 + $\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon$ > 0. {\textcopyright} 2008 INFORMS.},

We approach this problem as video-to-video translation using pose as an intermediate representation. To transfer the motion, we extract poses from the source subject and apply the learned pose-to-appearance mapping to generate the target subject. We predict two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results and introduce a separate pipeline for realistic face synthesis. Although our method is quite simple, it produces surprisingly compelling results (see video). This motivates us to also provide a forensics tool for reliable synthetic content detection, which is able to distinguish videos synthesized by our system from real data. In addition, we release a first-of-its-kind open-source dataset of videos that can be legally used for training and motion transfer.},

abstract = {This thesis addresses imitative digital sound synthesis of acoustically viable instruments with support of expressive, high-level control parameters. A general model is provided for quasi-harmonic instruments that reacts coherently with its acoustical equivalent when control parameters are varied. The approach builds upon recording-based methods and uses signal transformation techniques to manipulate instrument sound signals in a manner that resembles the behavior of their acoustical equivalents using the fundamental control parameters intensity and pitch. The method preserves the inherent quality of discretized recordings of a sound of acoustic instruments and introduces a transformation method that retains the coherency with its timbral variations when control parameters are modified. It is thus meant to introduce parametric control for sampling sound synthesis. The objective of this thesis is to introduce a new general model representing the timbre variations of quasi-harmonic music instruments regarding a parameter space determined by the control parameters pitch as well as global and instantaneous intensity. The model independently represents the deterministic and non-deterministic components of an instrument's signal and an extended source-filter model will be introduced for the former to represent the excitation and resonance characteristics of a music instrument by individual parametric filter functions. The latter component will be represented using a classic source-filter approach using filters with similar parameterization. All filter functions are represented using tensor-product B-splines to support for multivariate control variables. An algorithm will be presented for the estimation of the model's parameters that allows for the joint estimation of the filter functions of either component in a multivariate surface-fitting approach using a data-driven optimization strategy. This procedure also includes smoothness constraints and solutions for missing or sparse data and requires suitable data sets of single note recordings of a particular musical instrument. Another original contribution of the present thesis is an algorithm for the calibration of a note's intensity by means of an analysis of crescendo and decrescendo signals using the presented instrument model. The method enables the adjustment of the note intensity of an instrument sound coherent with the relative differences between varied values of its note intensity. A subjective evaluation procedure is presented to assess the quality of the transformations obtained using a calibrated instrument model and independently varied control parameters pitch and note intensity. Several extends of sound signal manipulations will be presented therein. For the support of inharmonic sounds as present in signals produced by the piano, a new algorithm for the joint estimation of a signal's fundamental frequency and inharmonicity coefficient is presented to extend the range of possible instruments to be manageable by the system. The synthesis system will be evaluated in various ways for sound signals of a trumpet, a clarinet, a violin and a piano.},

Data obtained by electrostatic probes form the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the clean air boundary-layer plasma of a slender re-entry vehicle. Corroboration of two independent, yet complementary, theoretical models has been obtained: 1) A simple diffusion/convection model determines electron levels within the plasma on the basis of measured probe currents. Independence of the probe bias for a range of altitudes and positions on the vehicle is strong evidence of this model's essential correctness; 2) A complete numerical solution to the equations governing the vehicle's hypersonic, reacting flowfield has been generated. The boundary-layer plasma is embedded in this solution as a trace species (e-) distribution. Agreement between the calculated electron densities and the processed probe data is qualitatively complete and quantitatively compelling: for a wide range of altitudes and all probe stations the agreement is within experimental accuracy. {\textcopyright} 1973 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs-directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions- and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function's gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The generic scheme we propose unifies estimators derived in variety of prior work, along with variance-reduction techniques therein. It could assist researchers in developing intricate models involving a combination of stochastic and deterministic operations, enabling, for example, attention, memory, and control actions.},

The visual features are used to "focus" the audio on desired speakers in a scene and to improve the speech separation quality. To train our joint audio-visual model, we introduce AVSpeech, a new dataset comprised of thousands of hours of video segments from the Web. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to classic speech separation tasks, as well as real-world scenarios involving heated interviews, noisy bars, and screaming children, only requiring the user to specify the face of the person in the video whose speech they want to isolate. Our method shows clear advantage over stateof- the-art audio-only speech separation in cases of mixed speech. In addition, our model, which is speaker-independent (trained once, applicable to any speaker), produces better results than recent audio-visual speech separation methods that are speaker-dependent (require training a separate model for each speaker of interest).},

@article{Makhoul1975,
abstract = {This paper gives an exposition of linear prediction in the analysis of discrete signals. The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. in the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an “optimal” number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. for purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients. Finally, a brief introduction to pole-zero modeling is given. {\textcopyright} 1975, IEEE. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A method is proposed to estimate the enthalpy of bio-oil in the vapor phase, Hbo, as a function of temperature in the range 298.15–1000 K, of which experimental determination has not been done so far. The two equations proposed in this work allow estimation of the standard enthalpy of formation, Hbo,0, and the difference in the enthalpy between 298.15 K and a given temperature, $\Delta$Hbo(T), respectively, only based on the overall C, H, and O contents of crude bio-oil of that N and S contents are lower than 0.5 and 0.1 wt %-daf, respectively. These equations were optimized using thermodynamic data of 290 and 141 organic compounds for Hbo,0, and $\Delta$Hbo(T), respectively. Given the yields of bio-oil, char, and gas, elemental compositions of the bio-oil and char, and chemical composition of the gas, proposed equations predict the heat required for biomass pyrolysis, Qpy(Tpy), which is defined as the enthalpy difference between the products at the pyrolysis temperature, Tpy, and the biomass at 298.15 K. The predicted Qpy at Tpy = 773–823 K for five different types of dry biomass was in the range of 1.1–1.6 MJ kg–1.},

Very specifically, we show that the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) contaminating a signal can be filtered best by using a Gaussian filter of specific characteristics. The design of the Gaussian filter bears relationship with the noise statistics and also some basic information about the signal. We first derive a relationship between the properties of the Gaussian filter, noise statistics and the signal and later show through experiments that this relationship can be used effectively to identify the optimal Gaussian filter that can effectively filter noise.},

abstract = {The stochastic knapsack problem is a stochastic resource allocation problem that arises frequently and yet is exceptionally hard to solve. We derive and study an optimistic planning algorithm specifically designed for the stochastic knapsack problem. Unlike other optimistic planning algorithms for MDPs, our algorithm, OpStoK, avoids the use of discounting and is adaptive to the amount of resources available. We achieve this behavior by means of a concentration inequality that simultaneously applies to capacity and reward estimates. Crucially, we are able to guarantee that the aforementioned confidence regions hold collectively over all time steps by an application of Doob's inequality. We demonstrate that the method returns an -optimal solution to the stochastic knapsack problem with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first which provides such guarantees for the stochastic knapsack problem. Furthermore, our algorithm is an anytime algorithm and will return a good solution even if stopped prematurely. This is particularly important given the difficulty of the problem. We also provide theoretical conditions to guarantee OpStoK does not expand all policies and demonstrate favorable performance in a simple experimental setting.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives. In the EORTC ALL-3 trial, the efficacy of allogeneic transplantation was compared with that of autologous marrow transplantation and maintenance chemotherapy in patients ≤ 50 years who reached CR. Design and Methods. Among 340 patients who entered the study, 279 were ≤ 50 years old. Out of these, 220 reached CR, 184 patients started consolidation and were HLA typed; 68 had a donor and 116 had no sibling donor. The median follow-up was 9.5 years; 93 patients relapsed, 26 died in CR, and overall 116 patients died. Allogeneic transplantation was performed in 47 (68%) patients with a donor while autologous transplantation or maintenance chemotherapy was given to 84 (72%) patients without a sibling donor. Results. The 6-year disease-free survival rate was similar in the groups with and without donor [38.2% (SE=5.9%) vs. 36.8% (SE=4.6%), hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.67-1.53]. Comparing the donor group with the no donor group, the former had a lower relapse incidence (38.2% vs. 56.3%, p=0.001), but a higher cumulative incidence of death in CR (23.5% vs. 6.9%, p=0.0004). The 6-year survival rates were similar [41.2% (SE=6.0%) vs. 38.8% (SE=4.6%)]. Interpretation and Conclusions. This trial did not show that allogeneic transplantation, when a sibling donor is available, produces a better outcome than the policy of offering autotransplantation or chemotherapy in the absence of a donor.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the use of symmetric convolution and the discrete sine and cosine transforms (DST's & DCT's) for general digital signal processing. The operation of symmetric convolution is a formalized approach to convolving symmetrically extended sequences. The result is the same as that obtained by taking an inverse discrete trigonometric transform (DTT) of the product of the forward DTT's of those two sequences. There are 16 members in the family of DTT's. Each provides a representation for a corresponding distinct type of symmetric-periodic sequence. In this paper, we define symmetric convolution, relate the DST's and DCT's to symmetric-periodic sequences, and then use these principles to develop simple but powerful convolution-multiplication properties for the entire family of DST's and DCT's. Symmetric convolution can be used for discrete linear filtering when the filter is symmetric or antisymmetric. The filtering will be efficient because fast algorithms exist for all versions of the DTT's. Conventional linear convolution is possible if we first zero-pad the input data. Symmetric convolution and its fast implementation using DTT's are now an alternative to circular convolution and the DFT. {\textcopyright} 1994 IEEE},

(Academy of Management Review 22, 853-886; 1997). We use a multi-method, comparative case study of two large-scale sporting event organizing committees, with a particular focus on interviews with managers at three hierarchical levels. We support the positive relationship between number of stakeholder attributes and perceived stakeholder salience. Managers' hierarchical level and role have direct and moderating effects on stakeholder identification and perceived salience. We also found that most stakeholders were definitive, dominant, or dormant types - the other five types were rare. Power has the most important effect on salience, followed by urgency and legitimacy. Based on our case study, we offer several ways to advance the theory of stakeholder identification and salience. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In this paper the concept of IF is extended to be able to cope with discrete time signals. The specific problem explored is that of estimating the IF of frequency modulated (FM) discrete-time signals imbedded in Gaussian noise. There are many well established methods for estimating the IF—these methods include differentiation of the phase and smoothing thereof, adaptive frequency estimation techniques such as the phase locked loop (PLL), and extraction of the peak from time-varying spectral representations. More recently methods based on a modeling of the signal phase as a polynomial have been introduced. All of these methods are reviewed, and their performances are compared on both simulated and real data. Guidelines are given as to which estimation method should be used for a given signal class and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), reasoning, intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence.},

Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

abstract = {In this work we propose a novel interpretation of residual networks showing that they can be seen as a collection of many paths of differing length. Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the problem of locating singing voice in music tracks. As opposed to most existing methods for this task, we rely on the extraction of the characteristics specific to singing voice. In our approach we suppose that the singing voice is characterized by harmonicity, formants, vibrato and tremolo. In the present study we deal only with the vibrato and tremolo characteristics. For this, we first extract sinusoidal partials from the musical audio signal . The frequency modulation (vibrato) and amplitude modulation (tremolo) of each partial are then studied to determine if the partial corresponds to singing voice and hence the corresponding segment is supposed to contain singing voice. For this we estimate for each partial the rate (frequency of the modulations) and the extent (amplitude of modulation) of both vibrato and tremolo. A partial selection is then operated based on these values. A second criteria based on harmonicity is also introduced. Based on this, each segment can be labelled as singing or non-singing. Post-processing of the segmentation is then applied in order to remove short-duration segments. The proposed method is then evaluated on a large manually annotated test-set. The results of this evaluation are compared to the one obtained with a usual machine learning approach (MFCC and SFM modeling with GMM). The proposed method achieves very close results to the machine learning approach : 76.8% compared to 77.4% F-measure (frame classification). This result is very promising, since both approaches are orthogonal and can then be combined. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

Moreover, the developed computational tool was essential illustrating behaviors that used to be hard to visualize: acoustic waves. Sound radiation data were calculated from the vibration of the top plate model. These data were sliced to detect acoustic wavefronts and directivity patterns. Experimental and computational procedures developed in this work were useful illustrating vibroacoustic behaviors. Mode shapes and natural frequencies in the thin film experiment were clearly detected. Scientific visualization software showed ability to display vibroacoustic information in high density, with much semantic substance and time savings.

Music accompaniment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace, because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method. Evaluations on the MIR-1K dataset show that this method can achieve around 1∼1.4 dB higher GNSDR compared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior training or requiring particular features. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a gating recurrent mixture density network (GRMDN) architecture to jointly address these two problems in neural network based SPSS. What's more, the gated recurrent unit (GRU), which is much simpler and has more intelligible work mechanism than LSTM, is also investigated as an alternative gating unit in RNN based acoustic modeling. Experimental results show that the proposed GRMDN architecture can synthesize more natural speech than its MSE-trained counterpart and both the two gating units (LSTM and GRU) show comparable performance.},

Our general approach is based on measuring the directivity of an acoustic violin, and designing a digital filter structure that mimics the observed directivity while allowing interactive operation. The digital filter structure is fed by the electrical signal coming from a silent electric violin as played by a musician. In a hemi-anechoic chamber, we use a microphone array to characterize the frequency-dependent directivity transfer function of a real violin by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the acoustic pressure at 4320 points on a sphere surrounding the instrument. From the input force and output pressure signals obtained from the real violin measurements, we use deconvolution to estimate 4320 impulse responses each corresponding to a radiation direction. With such impulse responses, we use State Wave Synthesis to model the observed directivity in time-varying conditions and efficiently render directional wavefronts in a virtual environment. We characterize the silent violin transfer function by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the electrical signal at its output, leading to an impulse response that we use to design an inverse filter to recover the force excitation at the bridge.},

We first redecode speech logged by our production recognizer with a very accurate (and hence too slow for real-time usage) set of speech models to improve the quality of ground truth transcripts used for training alignments. Using confidence scores, transcript length and transcript flattening heuristics designed to cull salient utterances from three decades of speech per language, we then carefully select training data sets consisting of up to 15K hours of speech to be used to train acoustic models without any reliance on manual transcription. We show that this approach yields models with approximately 18K context dependent states that achieve 10% relative improvement in large vocabulary dictation and voice-search systems for Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian and Russian languages.},

To achieve rich, natural sounds, all of them require fast arithmetic capability, such as is found on expensive computers or digital synthesizers. For musicians and experimenters without access to these machines, musically interesting digital synthesis has been almost impossible. The techniques described in this paper can be implemented quite cheaply on almost any computer. Real-time synthesis implementations have been done for Intel 8080A (by Alex Strong), Texas Instruments TMS9900 (by Kevin Karplus), and SC/MP (by Mike Plass) microprocessors. David Jaffe and Julius Smith have programmed the Systems Concept Digital Synthesizer at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) to perform several variants of the algorithms (Jaffe and Smith 1983).},

Because these components are multidimensional, and due to a strong distributed non-linearity (the snare interaction), many techniques used frequently in physical modeling synthesis applications, such as digital waveguides and modal methods are difficult to apply. In this article, finite difference time domain techniques are applied to a full 3D system, and various features of interest, such as the coupling between membranes, and the interaction between the membranes and the snares, are examined in detail. Also discussed are various numerical features, such as spurious splitting of degenerate modes and bandwidth limitation, and estimates of computational complexity are provided.

abstract = {When the standard classical guitar is scaled up a musical fourth to a treble guitar, down a musical fifth to a baritone guitar, and down an octave to a bass guitar, design compromises are necessary to maintain playability and favourable tone qulality. The resulting instruments exhibit interesting natural vibration mode and sound radiation physics. The tone qualities of the new instruments suggest relations between the guitar response envelope and human sound perception. Translating the principle natural modes of the guitar up or down with string frequencies does not necessarily produce pleasing tone qualities nor optimal playing dynamics. However, designing bracing configurations for both classical and folk baritone and bass guitars to maximise low frequency radiation efficiency does seem to produce new instruments of musical appeal. Frequency response records of standard and guitar family variants illustrate the physical behaviour of the different designs. Experience of musicians with the guitar family instruments indicates that creative new guitar territory is available. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Six professional guitarists played movement sequences in a fixed tempo. Left-hand finger movements were recorded in 3 dimensions, and the guitar sound was recorded synchronously. Assuming that performers prefer to avoid extreme joint angles when moving, the authors hypothesized 3 complexity factors. The results showed differential effects of the complexity factors on the performance measures and on participants' judgments of complexity. The results demonstrated that keeping the joints in the middle of their range is an important principle in guitar playing, and players exploit the available tolerance in timing and placement of the left-hand fingers to control the acoustic output variability. {\textcopyright} 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Frequency analysis is performed on the simulated sound pressure and plate velocity waveforms in order to evaluate quantitatively the transfer of energy through the various components of the coupled system: from the string to the soundboard and from the soundboard to the air. The effects of some structural changes in soundboard thickness and cavity volume on the produced sounds are presented and discussed. Simulations of the same guitar in three different cases are also performed: "in vacuo," in air with a perfectly rigid top plate, and in air with an elastic top plate. This allows comparisons between structural, acoustic, and structural-acoustic modes of the instrument. Finally, attention is paid to the evolution with time of the spatial pressure field. This shows, in particular, the complex evolution of the directivity pattern in the near field of the instrument, especially during the attack.},

In this work, we present a comparative study of the guitar box in which the interior gas is changed both experimentally and numerically. Modal patterns, natural frequencies and quality factors are determined when the box is full of helium, air and krypton, respectively. This allows us to characterise the soundboard-back plate coupling via the cavity fluid, stressing the role of the structural and acoustic uncoupled modes. This could help guitar makers, allowing them to modify the final modes by means of structural modifications. Moreover the methodology, together with the developed finite element model, proves to be valid for studying the dynamic fluid-structure coupling in any arbitrary mechanical system, including cavities connected to the surrounding air. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this work the effect of two different bridge configurations on the vibrations of the top plate of a classical guitar is presented. Experimental harmonic analysis and visualization techniques, in addition to detailed damped simulations using the finite element method, were used to obtain mobility functions and operating deflection shapes of a top plate. The mobility functions were obtained in the following sequence. First the mobility functions were obtained on the top plate without a bridge attached. Then a bridge was glued to the top plate and new measurements were made. Finally the already attached bridge was cross-cut in situ without detaching it from the top plate, and the measurements were repeated. Those specific designs were chosen on the grounds of simplicity of construction both experimentally and in FEM simulations (no particular preference for those designs is implied). The assembly and the specific design of the bridge have shown to have considerable influence on the response of the top plate regarding the mode shapes above 300 Hz. Depending on the geometry of the bridge, its deflections can either be comparable to the maximum deflections of the top plate or can have amplitudes so small that the bridge effectively creates a nodal zone on the plate vibrations. This suggests that the shape, the stiffness, and the mass properties of the bridge may play a role in the sound quality of the instrument. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The goal of the design process is to create a tone as sonically close to that of a traditional guitar as possible, while maintaining an easily replaceable soundboard. An iterative, data driven approach was used, each design step coming under examination from one or more measurement tools: finite-element method, acoustic impulse testing, and laser vibrometry. Ideal resonator geometry, bridge location, and piezoelectric sensor positions were determined. The finished instrument was then examined with laser vibrometry to confirm earlier results, evaluate the behavior and chosen sensor positions for various tonewoods, and examine the acoustic effects of adding sensors and wax finish. The conclusions drawn are diverse and point to the significance of attention to detail in each step of instrument construction. For example, when changing instrument material from one softwood to another, ideal locations for piezoelectric sensors are subject to change. We conclude that detailed acoustic analysis can significantly aid in the construction of new instruments by quantifying the impact of instrument geometry and material properties. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The modal analysis technique is applied in the determination of the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes. The main dimensions of an actual Brazilian guitar body are used to build the computational model geometry. The numerical modal analysis uses finite element method (FEM) to determine the dynamic behavior of the vibroacoustic system, which is composed by the structural and acoustic systems coupled. The experimental modal analysis is carried out in an actual Brazilian guitar body, where the structural modal parameters (frequency and mode shape) are extracted and used to update the numerical model.

@article{Pedgley2009,
abstract = {This paper presents a case study of research leading to a significant innovation in the acoustic guitar sector (1). The acoustic guitar is a result of centuries of design and development with wood, and has evolved into an archetypal and traditional product with a relatively conservative user base. As with many other product sectors, most acoustic guitars are now mass-produced in China, where low labour costs contribute to an average out-of-factory price of just $20 USID. This paper describes research into a dramatic shift in guitar materials, away from wood fabrication, towards the assembly of industrially moulded thermoplastic components. It is proposed that such a shift in materials can lead to competitive mass-manufacture of acoustic guitars outside of low labour cost countries, whilst invigorating the design of this popular musical instrument. Emphasis is placed on articulating the technical, aesthetic, market, and commercial requirements of a thermoplastic acoustic guitar. The crucial issue of sourcing appropriate forms of advice to aid product design is discussed. Focus is on the guitar soundboard, as the principal sound-generating component of the instrument. Three conclusions are reached, based on the patented soundboard technology that emerged from the research. First, instruments constructed. with foamed polycarbonate soundboards can rival the quality of wood counterparts, opening the way for a possible new industry of polymer musical instruments. Second, foamed polycarbonate soundboards have physical material properties surprisingly different to wood yet give equivalent acoustic performance. And third, innovation in this product sector benefits more from designerly ways of knowing and operating and less from scientific discoveries.},

A digital waveguide model is proposed for simulating the nonlin- earity inducing interactions between the vibrating string and the contact condition at the point of string termina- tion. The current work analyzes the resulting string mo- tion influenced by the contact conditions with mostly flat but slightly curved geometries. The effect of a minute im- perfection of the termination condition on the string vibra- tion is investigated. It is shown that the lossless string vi- brates in two distinct vibration regimes. In the beginning the string starts to interact in a nonlinear fashion with the bridge, and the resulting string motion is nonperiodic. The duration of that vibration regime depends on the geome- try of the bridge. After some time of nonperiodic vibra- tion, the string vibration settles in a periodic regime. Pre- sented results are applicable for example in the physics- based sound synthesis of stringed musical instruments, such as the shamisen, biwa, sitar, tambura, veena or even the bray harp and the grand piano.},

abstract = {Recent research in economic geography has emphasized tacit knowledge as the basis of industrial learning. In contrast, codification and the practices of industrial writing have received little attention for the roles they play in mobilizing knowledge across space. This paper offers insight into the geographies of codification through an examination of technology transfer in the electronic musical instrument industry between 1965 and 1995. The research draws on a variety of primary and secondary data that include interviews with inventors, biographical accounts and patent analysis. These sources offer perspective on the career trajectories of three U.S. inventors who transferred knowledge from various contexts in California's high-tech industry to the Japanese firm, Yamaha. Conceptually, the paper draws on the actor-network theory and Latour's idea of translation to highlight the detours inventors must take to register novelty. The analysis reveals the problematic nature of codified knowledge and its transfer; in this case codified knowledge was mobile internationally but not locally, at least until it reached Japan. The paper argues for the need to understand how texts such as patents are produced-the context of their authorship, the geographies of their circulation and their efficacy for shaping further innovative practice. {\textcopyright} 2006 Canadian Association of Geographers/L'Association canadienne des g{\'{e}}ographes.},

We present the basic theory and a discussion on possible extensions for each modelling technique. For some methods, a simple model example is chosen from the existing literature demonstrating a typical use of the method. For instance, in the case of the digital waveguide modelling technique a vibrating string model is discussed, and in the case of the wave digital filter technique we present a classical piano hammer model. We tackle some nonlinear and time-varying models and include new results on the digital waveguide modelling of a nonlinear string.

Quite a number of the early research results are now standard components of many audio and music devices and new technologies are continuously being developed and integrated into new products. Through the years there have been important changes. For example, most of the abstract algorithms that were the focus of work in the 70s and 80s are considered obsolete. Then the 1990s saw the emergence of computational approaches that aimed either at capturing the characteristics of a sound source, known as physical models, or at capturing the perceptual characteristics of the sound signal, generally referred to as spectral or signal models. More recent trends include the combination of physical and spectral models and the corpus-based concatenative methods. But the field faces major challenges that might revolutionize the standard paradigms and applications of sound synthesis. In this article we will first place the sound synthesis topic within its research context, then we will highlight some of the current trends, and finally we will attempt to identify some challenges for the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Collisions play an important role in many aspects of the physics of musical instruments. The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and percussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others include reed-beating efects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction in fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the wire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective, whether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or sound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various dificulties, not the least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a novel finite diference time domain simulation framework for such collision problems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical energy conservation or dissipation, and where a power law formulation for collisions is employed, as a potential function within a passive formulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and as a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of such methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are presented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation, bounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as various aspects of musical instrument physics.},

abstract = {Collisions are an innate part of the function of many musical instruments. Due to the nonlinear nature of contact forces, special care has to be taken in the construction of numerical schemes for simulation and sound synthesis. Finite difference schemes and other time-stepping algorithms used for musical instrument modelling purposes are normally arrived at by discretising a Newtonian description of the system. However because impact forces are non-analytic functions of the phase space variables, algorithm stability can rarely be established this way. This paper presents a systematic approach to deriving energy conserving schemes for frictionless impact modelling. The proposed numerical formulations follow from discretising Hamilton's equations of motion, generally leading to an implicit system of nonlinear equations that can be solved with Newton's method. The approach is first outlined for point mass collisions and then extended to distributed settings, such as vibrating strings and beams colliding with rigid obstacles. Stability and other relevant properties of the proposed approach are discussed and further demonstrated with simulation examples. The methodology is exemplified through a case study on tanpura string vibration, with the results confirming the main findings of previous studies on the role of the bridge in sound generation with this type of string instrument.},

In this contribution, we introduce a procedure to develop appropriate tools inspired from geometric integration in order to simulate musical sounds. Geometric integrators are numerical integrators of excellent quality that are designed exclusively for Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations. The introduced procedure is a combination of two techniques in geometric integration: the semi-discretization method by Celledoni et al. (J Comput Phys 231:6770–6789, 2012) and symplectic partitioned Runge–Kutta methods. This combination turns out to be a right procedure that derives numerical schemes that are effective and suitable for computation of musical sounds. By using this procedure we derive a series of explicit integration algorithms for a simple model describing piano sounds as a representative example for virtual instruments. We demonstrate the advantage of the numerical methods by evaluating a variety of numerical test cases.},

abstract = {Acoustic musical instruments act as dynamic sound sources communicating the expressive intentions of a performer to the audience in a dedicated spatial environment. From an acoustical point of view, the directivity of musical instruments is relevant both for the loudness and timbre of an instrument at a certain position in the audience, as well as for the spatial characteristics of the generated sound field. Musical instruments, however, are dynamic sound sources always moved by musicians as an element of their performance on stage. This work aims at assessing the acoustical effect and the perceptual relevance of these movements. For this purpose, we have recorded solo musical performances with all standard orchestral instruments with an optical motion tracking system, as well as the corresponding audio signals. The effect of the movements was evaluated by analysing the spectral fluctuation and the time-dependence of room acoustical parameters in a virtual acoustic environment in anechoic and reverberant conditions. In a subsequent listening test, an auralization of the static and dynamic musical performance was presented to listeners by binaural synthesis, showing that the signal-related fluctuations are clearly audible both in anechoic and reverberant situations. We discuss different approaches how to consider these effects for the simulation of natural acoustic sources in virtual acoustic reality.},

abstract = {The physics of musical instruments often uses modal analysis as one of the most important methods for describing the behavior of sound chests and their acoustic radiation. However, some studies conducted in Europe (Wogram), Japan (Suzuki) and the United States (Giordano) underlined a very weak correlation between sound radiation and modal analysis. This mismatch required further research. The acoustic parameter intensity of acoustic radiation (IAR) is highly related to the mechanical vibration of the sound source. IAR was able to quantify the sound efficiency of musical instruments, and to relate sound radiation with modal analysis. This paper investigates IAR measured on three Persian stringed musical Instruments, namely the thar, si-thar and santoor. The analysis contributes to the knowledge of stringed musical instruments and sound propagation, since IAR is capable of linking the mechanical vibrations of soundboards with the sound generation of the musical instruments. The IAR results coming from the modal analysis carried out during the study of the instruments are reported herein.},

abstract = {Similarity is an important concept in music cognition research since the similarity between (parts of) musical pieces determines perception of stylistic categories and structural relationships between parts of musical works. The purpose of the present research is to develop and test models of musical similarity perception inspired by a transformational approach which conceives of similarity between two perceptual objects in terms of the complexity of the cognitive operations required to transform the representation of the first object into that of the second, a process which has been formulated in information-theoretic terms. Specifically, computational simulations are developed based on compression distance in which a probabilistic model is trained on one piece of music and then used to predict, or compress, the notes in a second piece. The more predictable the second piece according to the model, the more efficiently it can be encoded and the greater the similarity between the two pieces. The present research extends an existing information-theoretic model of auditory expectation (IDyOM) to compute compression distances varying in symmetry and normalisation using high-level symbolic features representing aspects of pitch and rhythmic structure. Comparing these compression distances with listeners' similarity ratings between pairs of melodies collected in three experiments demonstrates that the compression-based model provides a good fit to the data and allows the identification of representations, model parameters and compression-based metrics that best account for musical similarity perception. The compression-based model also shows comparable performance to the best-performing algorithms on the MIREX 2005 melodic similarity task.},

abstract = {Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.},

A general solution to parameters estimation problem is provided along this paper which is based on a supervised convolutional machine learning paradigm. The described approach can be classified as "end-to-end" and requires, thus, no specific knowledge of the model itself. Furthermore, parameters are learned from data generated by the model, requiring no effort in the preparation and labeling of the training dataset. To provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the performance, this method is applied to a patented digital waveguide pipe organ model, yielding very promising results.},

Whenever such models are used for commercial applications, an additional constraint is the time to market, making automation of the sound design process desirable. In previous works, a computational sound design approach has been proposed for the parameter estimation problem involving timbre matching by deep learning, which was applied to the synthesis of pipe organ tones. In this paper, we refine previous results by introducing the former approach in a multi-stage algorithm that also adds heuristics and a stochastic optimization method operating on perceptually motivated objective cost functions. The optimization method shows to be able to refine the first estimate given by the deep learning approach and substantially improve the objective metrics, with the additional benefit of reducing the sound design process time. Subjective listening tests are also conducted to gather additional insights on the results.},

They are modified to apply to strings having a solid-steel core upon which are wrapped one or two copper windings. The bass strings of most pianos are made this way. Two boundary conditions are considered: namely, (1) pinned by sharp knife edges at both ends and (2) clamped at both ends. Formulas for the partial frequencies for both of these conditions are developed. The partial frequencies that are calculated by these formulas are compared to the experimental values obtained on an upright Hamilton piano. The experimental values appear to agree somewhat better with the pinned boundary condition rather than the clamped boundary condition, although the differences are not much greater than the observational error. It was found that the formula fn = nfi[(l+Bn2)/(l+B)y gives values of the partial frequencies that agree with the experimental ones where n is the number of the partial,/the fundamental frequency, and B a constant that can be calculated from the dimensions of the wire. {\textcopyright} 1964, Acoustical Society of America.

This performance mimics the real singing of a singer that has been previously recorded, analyzed and stored in a database, in which we store his voice characteristics (phonetics) and his low-level expressivity (attacks, releases, note transitions and vibratos). To synthesize such performance the systems concatenates a set of elemental synthesis units (phonetic articulations and stationeries). These units are obtained by transposing and time-scaling the database samples. The concatenation of these transformed samples is performed by spreading out the spectral shape and phase discontinuities of the boundaries along a set of transition frames that surround the joint frames. The expression of the singing is applied through a Voice Model built up on top of a Spectral Peak Processing (SPP) technique. SPP considers the spectrum as a set of regions. Each region is made up of one spectral peak and its surroundings and can be shifted both in frequency and amplitude. The Voice Model is based on an improved version of the traditional excitation/filter approach. The system will be demonstrated with several performances.},

Large instrumental databases with standardised intensities like the Virtual Orchestra are required. For each sound of the database, an average spectral envelope is calculated. An error minimisation algorithm optimises the similarity of the orchestration's envelope in relation to the phoneme. Among other pieces, this method was applied in the orchestra piece Nicanor, premiered 1999 in Stuttgart. A considerable similarity of the respective orchestral sequence to the sound of the whispered word is perceived.},

For constant velocities the equation for the radius of curvature reduces to the original Huygens' Principle.

abstract = {Many computer vision and human-computer interaction applications developed in recent years need evaluating complex and continuous mathematical functions as an essential step toward proper operation. However, rigorous evaluation of these kind of functions often implies a very high computational cost, unacceptable in real-time applications. To alleviate this problem, functions are commonly approximated by simpler piecewise-polynomial representations. Following this idea, we propose a novel, efficient, and practical technique to evaluate complex and continuous functions using a nearly optimal design of two types of piecewise linear approximations in the case of a large budget of evaluation subintervals. To this end, we develop a thorough error analysis that yields asymptotically tight bounds to accurately quantify the approximation performance of both representations. It provides an improvement upon previous error estimates and allows the user to control the tradeoff between the approximation error and the number of evaluation subintervals. To guarantee real-time operation, the method is suitable for, but not limited to, an efficient implementation in modern graphics processing units, where it outperforms previous alternative approaches by exploiting the fixed-function interpolation routines present in their texture units. The proposed technique is a perfect match for any application requiring the evaluation of continuous functions; we have measured in detail its quality and efficiency on several functions, and, in particular, the Gaussian function because it is extensively used in many areas of computer vision and cybernetics, and it is expensive to evaluate.},

abstract = {Extreme learning machine (ELM), as a new learning framework, draws increasing attractions in the areas of large-scale computing, high-speed signal processing, artificial intelligence, and so on. ELM aims to break the barriers between the conventional artificial learning techniques and biological learning mechanism and represents a suite of machine learning techniques in which hidden neurons need not to be tuned. ELM theories and algorithms argue that “random hidden neurons” capture the essence of some brain learning mechanisms as well as the intuitive sense that the efficiency of brain learning need not rely on computing power of neurons. Thus, compared with traditional neural networks and support vector machine, ELM offers significant advantages such as fast learning speed, ease of implementation, and minimal human intervention. Due to its remarkable generalization performance and implementation efficiency, ELM has been applied in various applications. In this paper, we first provide an overview of newly derived ELM theories and approaches. On the other hand, with the ongoing development of multilayer feature representation, some new trends on ELM-based hierarchical learning are discussed. Moreover, we also present several interesting ELM applications to showcase the practical advances on this subject.},

The key challenges in unconventional reservoirs have been the requirement to put online a) a large number of wells in a short period of time, b) well productivity significantly driven by completion characteristics and that c) the physics of fluid flow in these prospects still remain uncertain. In this paper, machine learning algorithms are used to forecast production for existing and new wells in unconventional assets using inputs like geological maps, production history, pressure data and operational constraints. One of the most popular Machine Learning methods - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed for this purpose. ANN can learn from large volume of data points without assuming a predetermined model and can adapt to newer data as and when it becomes available. The workflow involves using these data sets to train and optimize the ANN model which, subsequently, is used to predict the well production performance of both existing wells using their own history and new wells by using the history of nearby wells which were drilled in analogous geological locations. The proposed technique requires users to do less data conditioning and model building and focus more on analyzing what-if scenarios and determining the well performance.},

To address this problem, the hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) framework was proposed based on the hierarchical learning architecture of multilayer perceptron. H-ELM composes of two parts; the first is the unsupervised multilayer encoding part and the second part is the supervised feature classification part. H-ELM can give higher accuracy rate than of the traditional ELM. However, it still has to enhance its classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method namely as the extending hierarchical extreme learning machine (EH-ELM). For the extended supervisor part of EH-ELM, we have got an idea from the two-layers extreme learning machine. To evaluate the performance of EH-ELM, three different image datasets; Semeion, MNIST, and NORB, were studied.

The experimental results show that the proposed clustering algorithm Extreme Learning Machine Auto Encoder Clustering (ELM-AEC) is better than k-means clustering and is competitive with Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machine (USELM).},

abstract = {This paper describes the learning and control capabilities of a biologically constrained bottom-up model of the mammalian cerebellum. Results are presented from six tasks: 1) eyelid conditioning; 2) pendulum balancing; 3) proportional-integral-derivative control; 4) robot balancing; 5) pattern recognition; and 6) MNIST handwritten digit recognition. These tasks span several paradigms of machine learning, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, control, and pattern recognition. Results over these six domains indicate that the cerebellar simulation is capable of robustly identifying static input patterns even when randomized across the sensory apparatus. This capability allows the simulated cerebellum to perform several different supervised learning and control tasks. On the other hand, both reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition prove problematic due to the delayed nature of error signals and the simulator's inability to solve the credit assignment problem. These results are consistent with previous findings which hypothesize that in the human brain, the basal ganglia is responsible for reinforcement learning, while the cerebellum handles supervised learning.},

abstract = {In today's data-driven economy, operators that integrate vast stores of fundamental reservoir and production data with the highperformance predictive analytics solutions can emerge as winners in the contest of maximizing estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The scope of this study is to demonstrate a new workflow coupling earth sciences with data analytics to operationalize well completion optimization. The workflow aims to build a robust predictive model that allows users to perform sensitivity analysis on completion designs within a few hours. Current workflows for well completion and production optimization in unconventional reservoirs require extensive earth modeling, fracture simulation, and production simulations. With considerable effort and wide scale of sensitivity, studies could enable optimized well completion design parameters such as optimal cluster spacing, optimal proppant loading, optimal well spacing, etc. Yet, today, less than 5% of the wells fractured in North America are designed using advanced simulation due to the required level of data, skillset, and long computing times. Breaking these limitations through parallel fracture and reservoir simulations in the cloud and combining such simulation with data analytics and artificial intelligence algorithms helped in the development of a powerful solution that creates models for fast, yet effective, completion design. The approach was executed on Eagle Ford wells as a case study in 2016. Over 2000 data points were collected with completion sensitivity performed on a multithreaded cluster environment on these wells. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms of data analytics such as random forest, gradient boost, linear regression, etc. were applied on the data points to create a proxy model for the fracturing and numerical production simulator. With the gradient boost technique, over 90% accuracy was achieved between the proxy model and the actual results. Hence, the proxy model could predict the wellbore productivity accurately for any given change in completion design. The operators now had a much simpler model, which served as a plug-and-play tool for the completion engineers to evaluate the impact of changes in completion parameters on the future well performance and making fast-tracked economic decisions almost in real time. The approach can be replicated for varying geological and geomechanical properties as operations move from pad to pad. Although the need for heavy computing resource, simulation skillset, and long run times was eliminated with this new approach, regular QA/QC of the model through manual simulations makes the process more robust and reliable. The methodology provides an integrated approach to bridge the traditional reservoir understanding and simulation approach to the new big data approach to create proxies, which allows operators to make quicker decisions for completion optimization. The technique presented in this paper can be extended for other domains of wellsite operations such as well drilling, artificial lift, etc. and help operators evaluate the most economical scenario in close to real time.},

abstract = {Directional drilling is a complex process involving the remote control of tool alignment and force application to a very long drill string subject to variable external forces. Controlling bit tool face orientation while ensuring adequate rate of penetration (ROP) is quite challenging, with aspects that have been described as more art than science. Improving this control helps preserve proper well trajectory and eliminate deviations that require corrective measures and add to well costs. An artificial intelligence system was developed to learn from the actions of expert directional drillers and the mechanics of drilling simulations. Machine learning algorithms were employed to improve the efficiency of directional drilling: optimized ROP, less tortuous borehole, less personnel on board (POB), and consistency across operations. The system ingests historical and simulation data corresponding to the information used and actions taken by expert directional drillers and uses that data to generate decisions that result in efficient slide drilling. To create a system for controlling tool face angle and guiding drill bit sliding during directional drilling, relevant historical data from directional drilling operations was gathered. Much of this data was recorded in the drilling logs, which the drilling operator traditionally uses to control drilling parameters. The collected data was then filtered and used to structure and train artificial neural networks and select appropriate hyperparameters. Reinforcement learning methods were used to refine the neural networks trained on historical data. A computational model for drill string physics was used to simulate the mechanics of directional drilling. A successfully trained network was considered one that minimized deviation from planned wellbore trajectory, minimized tortuosity, and maximized ROP. The neural network developed could replicate the decisions of expert directional drillers within a small error (<3%). Reinforcement learning was then successfully used to improve network performance, particularly for conditions not previously considered. Since the algorithm has demonstrated competence in the historical and simulated realms, it will be further tested as a real-time advisory system for control of directional drilling operations. The system will be tested in simulation with an expert directional driller before use in a field drilling operation. Ultimately, the algorithm can be directly integrated into drilling operations, enabling fully automated directional drilling.},

abstract = {Drilling problems such as stick slip vibration/hole cleaning, pipe failures, loss of circulation, BHA whirl, stuck pipe incidents, excessive torque and drag, low ROP, bit wear, formation damage and borehole instability, and the drilling of highly tortuous wells have only been tackled using physics-based models. Despite the mammoth generation of real-time metadata, there is a tremendous gap between statistical based models and empirical, mathematical, and physical-based models. Data mining techniques have made prominent contributions across a broad spectrum of industries. Its value is widely appreciated in a variety of applications, but its potential has not been fully tapped in the oil and gas industry. This paper presents a review compiling several years of Data Analytics applications in the drilling operations. This review discusses the benefits, deficiencies of the present practices, challenges, and novel applications under development to overcome industry deficiencies. This study encompasses a comprehensive compilation of data mining algorithms and industry applications from a predictive analytics standpoint using supervised and unsupervised advanced analytics algorithms to identify hidden patterns and help mitigate drilling challenges. Traditional data preparation and analysis methods are not sufficiently capable of rapid information extraction and clear visualization of big complicated data sets. Due to the petroleum industry's unfulfilled demand, Machine Learning (ML)-assisted industry workflow in the fields of drilling optimization and real time parameter analysis and mitigation is presented. This paper summarizes data analytics case studies, workflows, and lessons learnt that would allow field personnel, engineers, and management to quickly interpret trends, detect failure patterns in operations, diagnose problems, and execute remedial actions to monitor and safeguard operations. The presence of such a comprehensive workflow can minimize tool failure, save millions in replacement costs and maintenance, NPV, lost production, minimize industry bias, and drive intelligent business decisions. This study will identify areas of improvement and opportunities to mitigate malpractices. Data exploitation via the proposed platform is based on well-established ML and data mining algorithms in computer sciences and statistical literature. This approach enables safe operations and handling of extremely large data bases, hence, facilitating tough decision-making processes.},

abstract = {Driven by recent computer vision and robotic applications, recovering 3D human poses has become increasingly important and attracted growing interests. In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the proposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D and 2D human poses in a type of 'free' self-supervision for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate 3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose projection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining geometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated 2D poses. Therefore, these two dual learning tasks enable our model to adaptively learn from 3D human pose data and external large-scale 2D human pose data. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop a 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship, temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our framework over all the compared competing methods.},

abstract = {3D human articulated pose recovery from monocular image sequences is very challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions, and also the human 3D pose is inherently ambiguous from the monocular imagery. It is thus critical to exploit rich spatial and temporal long-range dependencies among body joints for accurate 3D pose sequence prediction. Existing approaches usually manually design some elaborate prior terms and human body kinematic constraints for capturing structures, which are often insufficient to exploit all intrinsic structures and not scalable for all scenarios. In contrast, this paper presents a Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machine(RPSM) to automatically learn the image-dependent structural constraint and sequence-dependent temporal context by using a multi-stage sequential refinement. At each stage, our RPSM is composed of three modules to predict the 3D pose sequences based on the previously learned 2D pose representations and 3D poses: (i) a 2D pose module extracting the image-dependent pose representations, (ii) a 3D pose recurrent module regressing 3D poses and (iii) a feature adaption module serving as a bridge between module (i) and (ii) to enable the representation transformation from 2D to 3D domain. These three modules are then assembled into a sequential prediction framework to refine the predicted poses with multiple recurrent stages. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M dataset and HumanEva-I dataset show that our RPSM outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches for 3D pose estimation.},

abstract = {Intelligence pertains to the ability to make appropriate decisions in light of specific goals and to adapt behavior to meet those goals in a range of environments. Mathematical games provide a framework for studying intelligent behavior in models of real-worm settings or restricted domains. The behavior of alternative strategies in these games is defined by each individual's stimulus-response mapping. Limiting these behaviors to linear functions of the environmental conditions renders the results to be little more than a facade: effective decision making in any complex environment almost always requires nonlinear stimulus-response mappings. The obstacle then comes in choosing the appropriate representation and learning algorithm. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms provide useful means for addressing these issues. This paper describes efforts to hybridize neural and evolutionary computation to learn appropriate strategies in zero- and nonzero-sum games, including the iterated prisoner's dilemma, tic-tac-toe, and checkers. With respect to checkers, the evolutionary algorithm was able to discover a neural network that can be used to play at a near-expert level without injecting expert knowledge about how to play the game. The implications of evolutionary learning with respect to machine intelligence are also discussed. It is argued that evolution provides the framework for explaining naturally occurring intelligent entities and can be used to design machines that are also capable of intelligent behavior.},

abstract = {Evolving gradient-learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a popular approach to address the local optima and design problems of ANN. The typical approach is to combine the strength of backpropagation (BP) in weight learning and EA's capability of searching the architecture space. However, the BP's "gradient descent" approach requires a highly computer-intensive operation that relatively restricts the search coverage of EA by compelling it to use a small population size. To address this problem, we utilized mutation-based genetic neural network (MGNN) to replace BP by using the mutation strategy of local adaptation of evolutionary pogramming (EP) to effect weight learning. The MGNN's mutation enables the network to dynamically evolve its structure and adapt its weights at the same time. Moreover, MGNN's EP-based encoding scheme allows for a flexible and less restricted formulation of the fitness function and makes fitness computation fast and efficient. This makes it feasible to use larger population sizes and allows MGNN to have a relatively wide search coverage of the architecture space. MGNN implements a stopping criterion where overfitness occurrences are monitored through "sliding-windows" to avoid premature learning and overlearning. Statistical analysis of its performance to some well-known classification problems demonstrate its good generalization capability. It also reveals that locally adapting or scheduling the strategy parameters embedded in each individual network may provide a proper balance between the local and global searching capabilities of MGNN. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

The SOFNN is based on ellipsoidal basis function (EBF) neurons consisting of a center vector and a width vector. New methods of the structure learning and the parameter learning, based on new adding and pruning techniques and a recursive on-line learning algorithm, are proposed and developed. A proof of the convergence of both the estimation error and the linear network parameters is also given in the paper. The proposed methods are very simple and effective and generate a fuzzy neural model with a high accuracy and compact structure.

@article{Hsiao2005,
abstract = {When generating new design concepts, most industrial designers tend to draw upon stereotypical images and their own personal design experiences. The evaluation of each individual design candidate in terms of its ability to meet the demands of the marketplace is a crucial step within the conceptual design stage. Consequently, this paper proposes a method which enables an automatic product form search or product image evaluation by means of fuzzy neural network and genetic algorithm. Initially, a feature-based hierarchical computer-aided design (CAD) model is constructed, in which the related form parameters are thoroughly defined in applicable domains to facilitate the automatic generation of new product forms. A fuzzy neural network algorithm is then applied to establish the relationships between the input form parameters and a series of adjectival image words. In a reverse process, genetic algorithm is employed to search for a near-optimal design which satisfies the designer's required product image by using the trained neural network as a fitness function. The proposed method provides an automatic design system, which gives designers the ability to rapidly obtain a product form and its corresponding image, or to search for the ideal form which fits a required image in a shorter lead-time. An electronic door lock design is chosen as the subject of the current investigation. However, the proposed method is equally applicable to the design of other products. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The algorithm is derived for networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons, but it can be also applied to generic spiking neural networks. Learning is achieved by synaptic changes that depend on the firing ofpre- and postsynaptic neurons, and that are modulated with a global reinforcement signal. The efficacy of the algorithm is verified in a biologically-inspired experiment, featuring a simulated worm that searches for food. Our model recovers a form of neural plasticity experimentally observed in animals, combining spiketiming-dependent synaptic changes of one sign with nonassociative synaptic changes of the opposite sign determined by presynaptic spikes. The model also predicts that the time constant of spike-timing-dependent synaptic changes is equal to the membrane time constant of the neuron, in agreement with experimental observations in the brain. This study also led to the discovery of a biologically-plausible reinforcement learning mechanism that works by modulating spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a global reward signal. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been a hot topic of research for many years there still are certain issues regarding the development of an ANN model, resulting in a lack of absolute guarantee that the model will perform well for the problem at hand. The multitude of different approaches that have been adopted in order to deal with this problem have investigated all aspects of the ANN modelling procedure, from training data collection and pre/post-processing to elaborate training schemes and algorithms. Increased attention is especially directed to proposing a systematic way to establish an appropriate architecture in contrast to the current common practice that calls for a repetitive trial-and-error process, which is time-consuming and produces uncertain results. This paper proposes such a methodology for determining the best architecture and is based on the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and the development of novel criteria that quantify an ANN's performance (both training and generalization) as well as its complexity. This approach is implemented in software and tested based on experimental data capturing workpiece elastic deflection in turning. The intention is to present simultaneously the approach's theoretical background and its practical application in real-life engineering problems. Results show that the approach performs better than a human expert, at the same time offering many advantages in comparison to similar approaches found in literature. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a family of probabilistic symbolic polyphonic pitch models, which account for both the 'horizontal' and the 'vertical' pitch structure. These models are formulated as linear or log-linear interpolations of up to five sub-models, each of which is responsible for modeling a different type of relation. The ability of the models to predict symbolic pitch data is evaluated in terms of their cross-entropy, and of a newly proposed 'contextual cross-entropy' measure. Their performance is then measured on synthesized polyphonic audio signals in terms of the accuracy of multiple pitch estimation in combination with a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization-based acoustic model. In both experiments, the log-linear combination of at least one 'vertical' (e.g., harmony) and one 'horizontal' (e.g., note duration) sub-model outperformed a pitch-dependent Bernoulli prior by more than 60% in relative cross-entropy and 3% in absolute multiple pitch estimation accuracy. This work provides a proof of concept of the usefulness of model interpolation, which may be used for improved symbolic modeling of other aspects of music in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers.

These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d2) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields a speedup of D/4d, i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture.},

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

abstract = {The brain processes information through many layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but it complicates learning by making it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame to a neuron by computing exactly how it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies error signals by matrices consisting of all the synaptic weights on the neuron's axon and farther downstream. This operation requires a precisely choreographed transport of synaptic weight information, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we present a surprisingly simple algorithm for deep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by random synaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful information from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In essence, the network learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism performs as quickly and accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems and describe the principles which underlie its function. Our demonstration provides a plausible basis for how a neuron can be adapted using error signals generated at distal locations in the brain, and thus dispels long-held assumptions about the algorithmic constraints on learning in neural circuits.},

abstract = {The world is experiencing a data revolution to discover knowledge in big data. Large scale neural networks are one of the mainstream tools of big data analytics. Processing big data with large scale neural networks includes two phases: the training phase and the operation phase. Huge computing power is required to support the training phase. And the energy efficiency (power efficiency) is one of the major considerations of the operation phase. We first explore the computing power of GPUs for big data analytics and demonstrate an efficient GPU implementation of the training phase of large scale recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We then introduce a promising ultrahigh energy efficient implementation of neural networks' operation phase by taking advantage of the emerging memristor technique. Experiment results show that the proposed GPU implementation of RNNs is able to achieve 2 ∼ 11× speed-up compared with the basic CPU implementation. And the scaled-up recurrent neural network trained with GPUs realizes an accuracy of 47% on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge, the best result achieved by a single RNN on the same dataset. In addition, the proposed memristor-based implementation of neural networks demonstrates power efficiency of > 400 GFLOPS/W and achieves energy savings of 22× on the HMAX model compared with its pure digital implementation counterpart. {\textcopyright} 2014 EDAA.},

@article{Yosinski2014,
abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Trans-ferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

In this study, we compared both logistic regression models and feed-forward neural networks on the academic failure data set. Methods: The data for this study included 18 questions about study situation of 275 undergraduate students selected randomly from among nursing and midwifery and paramedic schools of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences in 2013. Logistic regression with forward method and feed forward Artificial Neural Network with 15 neurons in hidden layer were fitted to the dataset. The accuracy of the models in predicting academic failure was compared by using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and classification accuracy. Results: Among nine ANNs, the ANN with 15 neurons in hidden layer was a better ANN compared with LR. The Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of the LR model and ANN with 15 neurons in hidden layers, were estimated as 0.55 and 0.89, respectively and ANN was significantly greater than the LR. The LR and ANN models respectively classified 77.5% and 84.3% of the students correctly. Conclusion: Based on this dataset, it seems the classification of the students in two groups with and without academic failure by using ANN with 15 neurons in the hidden layer is better than the LR model.},

In this paper, we present a new algorithm, ANN-Miner, which uses ACO to learn the structure of feed-forward neural networks. We report computational results on 40 benchmark datasets for several variations of the algorithm. Performance is compared to the standard three-layer structure trained with two different weight-learning algorithms (back propagation, and the ACOR algorithm), and also to a greedy algorithm for learning NN structures. A nonparametric Friedman test is used to determine statistical significance.

From the physiological signals, we extract 52 electro-cardiogram (ECG) features and 22 electro-dermal activity (EDA) features from various analysis domains. The extracted features along with the AV +EC 2015 baseline features of audio, ECG or EDA are concatenated for a further feature selection step, in which the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), instead of the usual Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), has been used as objective function. In addition, offsets between the features and the arousal/valence labels are considered in both feature selection and modeling of the affective dimensions. For the fusion of multimodal features, we propose a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM-RNN) based multimodal affect prediction framework, in which the initial predictions from the single modalities via the DBLSTM-RNNs are firstly smoothed with Gaussian smoothing, then input into a second layer of DBLSTMRNN for the final prediction of affective state. Experimental results show that our proposed features and the DBLSTMRNN based fusion framework obtain very promising results. On the development set, the obtained CCC is up to 0.824 for arousal and 0.688 for valence, and on the test set, the CCC is 0.747 for arousal and 0.609 for valence.},

The deep network is trained using greedy layer-wise strategy. We use the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset for training and testing. Recognition tests are performed on six basic expressions (i.e. surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, sadness). To test the robustness of the classification system further, and for benchmark comparison, we add a seventh emotion, namely 'contempt', for additional recognition tests. We construct confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the deep network. It is demonstrated that the network generalizes to new images fairly successfully with an average recognition rate of 96.8% for six emotions and 91.7% for seven emotions.

Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by CNNs as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the CNN framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 LVCSR tasks indicate that a CNN with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12%-14% relative improvement in WER over a strong DNN system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks.},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate 'reasonable bounds' - linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

As the training/validation split is independent of the number of folds, the algorithm offers more flexibility in the size, and number of training samples compared to k-fold cross-validation. The study also provides for crogging and bagging: (1) the first systematic evaluation across time series length and combination size, (2) a bias and variance decomposition of the forecast errors to understand improvement gains, and (3) a comparison to established benchmarks of model averaging and selection. Crogging can easily be extended to other autoregressive models.

@article{Shin2016,
abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.},

We formally prove that these networks with random Gaussian weights perform a distance-preserving embedding of the data, with a special treatment for in-class and out-of-class data. Similar points at the input of the network are likely to have a similar output. The theoretical analysis of deep networks here presented exploits tools used in the compressed sensing and dictionary learning literature, thereby making a formal connection between these important topics. The derived results allow drawing conclusions on the metric learning properties of the network and their relation to its structure, as well as providing bounds on the required size of the training set such that the training examples would represent faithfully the unseen data. The results are validated with state-of-the-art trained networks.},

The effect of the new mapping is demonstrated on three benchmark problems. The first one is the early prediction of patient sleep stage event from temporal physiological data. The second one is the pattern recognition of dynamic temporal patterns of traffic in the Bay Area of California and the last one is the Challenge 2012 contest data set.

@article{Zhao2016,
abstract = {Objective functions for training of deep networks for facerelated recognition tasks, such as facial expression recognition (FER), usually consider each sample independently. In this work, we present a novel peak-piloted deep network (PPDN) that uses a sample with peak expression (easy sample) to supervise the intermediate feature responses for a sample of non-peak expression (hard sample) of the same type and from the same subject. The expression evolving process from non-peak expression to peak expression can thus be implicitly embedded in the network to achieve the invariance to expression intensities. A special-purpose backpropagation procedure, peak gradient suppression (PGS), is proposed for network training. It drives the intermediate-layer feature responses of nonpeak expression samples towards those of the corresponding peak expression samples, while avoiding the inverse.This avoids degrading the recognition capability for samples of peak expression due to interference from their non-peak expression counterparts. Extensive comparisons on two popular FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and CK+, demonstrate the superiority of the PPDN over state-of-the-art FER methods, as well as the advantages of both the network structure and the optimization strategy. Moreover, it is shown that PPDN is a general architecture, extensible to other tasks by proper definition of peak and non-peak samples. This is validated by experiments that show state-of-the-art performance on pose-invariant face recognition, using the Multi-PIE dataset.},

@article{Highlander2015,
abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently state-of-the-art for various classification tasks, but are computationally expensive. Propagating through the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer must sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward propagation which equates to $\mathcal{O}(N^{2}n^{2})$ per kernel per layer where the inputs are $N \times N$ arrays and the kernels are $n \times n$ arrays. Convolution can be efficiently performed as a Hadamard product in the frequency domain. The bottleneck is the transformation which has a cost of $\mathcal{O}(N^{2}\log_2 N)$ using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, the increase in efficiency is less significant when $N\gg n$ as is the case in CNNs. We mitigate this by using the "overlap-and-add" technique reducing the computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log_2 n)$ per kernel. This method increases the algorithm's efficiency in both the forward and backward propagation, reducing the training and testing time for CNNs. Our empirical results show our method reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16.3 times the traditional convolution implementation for a 8 $\times$ 8 kernel and a 224 $\times$ 224 image.},

However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts.

Most of the existing approaches are based on engineered features (e.g. HOG, LBPH, and Gabor) where the classifier's hyper-parameters are tuned to give best recognition accuracies across a single database, or a small collection of similar databases. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture to address the FER problem across multiple well-known standard face datasets. Specifically, our network consists of two convolutional layers each followed by max pooling and then four Inception layers. The network is a single component architecture that takes registered facial images as the input and classifies them into either of the six basic or the neutral expressions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on seven publicly available facial expression databases, viz. MultiPIE, MMI, CK+, DISFA, FERA, SFEW, and FER2013. The results of our proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods and better than traditional convolutional neural networks in both accuracy and training time.},

We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two- dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNel dataset.

abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can achieve significantly better performance on SPSS than deep feedforward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e.g., input gate, output gate, forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simplified architecture. The simplified architecture has significantly fewer parameters than an LSTM, thus reducing generation complexity considerably without degrading quality.},

This biologically inspired approach has created highly connected synthetic neurons and synapses that can be used to model neuroscience theories as well as solve challenging machine learning problems. The promise of the technology is to create a brainlike ability to learn and adapt, but the technical challenges are significant, starting with an accurate neuroscience model of how the brain works, to finding materials and engineering breakthroughs to build devices to support these models, to creating a programming framework so the systems can learn, to creating applications with brain-like capabilities. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of the research and motivations for neuromorphic computing over its history. We begin with a 35-year review of the motivations and drivers of neuromorphic computing, then look at the major research areas of the field, which we define as neuro-inspired models, algorithms and learning approaches, hardware and devices, supporting systems, and finally applications. We conclude with a broad discussion on the major research topics that need to be addressed in the coming years to see the promise of neuromorphic computing fulfilled. The goals of this work are to provide an exhaustive review of the research conducted in neuromorphic computing since the inception of the term, and to motivate further work by illuminating gaps in the field where new research is needed.},

Classifiers trained with textural descriptors (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, and Gabor filters) extracted from the spectrograms have achieved state-of-the-art results on several music datasets. In this work, though, we argue that we can go further with the time-frequency analysis through the use of representation learning. To show that, we compare the results obtained with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the results obtained by using handcrafted features and SVM classifiers. In addition, we have performed experiments fusing the results obtained with learned features and handcrafted features to assess the complementarity between these representations for the music classification task. Experiments were conducted on three music databases with distinct characteristics, specifically a western music collection largely used in research benchmarks (ISMIR 2004 Database), a collection of Latin American music (LMD database), and a collection of field recordings of ethnic African music. Our experiments show that the CNN compares favorably to other classifiers in several scenarios, hence, it is a very interesting alternative for music genre recognition. Considering the African database, the CNN surpassed the handcrafted representations and also the state-of-the-art by a margin. In the case of the LMD database, the combination of CNN and Robust Local Binary Pattern achieved a recognition rate of 92%, which to the best of our knowledge, is the best result (using an artist filter) on this dataset so far. On the ISMIR 2004 dataset, although the CNN did not improve the state of the art, it performed better than the classifiers based individually on other kind of features.},

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L2+1) direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.},

Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The prediction of near surface wind speed is becoming increasingly vital for the operation of electrical energy grids as the capacity of installed wind power grows. The majority of predictive wind speed modeling has focused on point-based time-series forecasting. Effectively balancing demand and supply in the presence of distributed wind turbine electricity generation, however, requires the prediction of wind fields in space and time. Additionally, predictions of full wind fields are particularly useful for future power planning such as the optimization of electricity power supply systems. In this paper, we propose a composite artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the 6-hour and 24-hour ahead average wind speed over a large area (-3.15×106km2). The ANN model consists of a convolutional input layer, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden layer, and a transposed convolutional layer as the output layer. We compare the ANN model with two non-parametric models, a null persistence model and a mean value model, and find that the ANN model has substantially smaller error than each of these models. Additionally, the ANN model also generally performs better than integrated autoregressive moving average models, which are trained for optimal performance in specific locations.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are currently among the most commonly used classifiers. Despite easily achieving very good performance, one of the best selling points of these models is their modular design - one can conveniently adapt their architecture to specific needs, change connectivity patterns, attach specialised layers, experiment with a large amount of activation functions, normalisation schemes and many others. While one can find impressively wide spread of various configurations of almost every aspect of the deep nets, one element is, in authors' opinion, underrepresented - while solving classification problems, vast majority of papers and applications simply use log loss. In this paper we try to investigate how particular choices of loss functions affect deep models and their learning dynamics, as well as resulting classifiers robustness to various effects. We perform experiments on classical datasets, as well as provide some additional, theoretical insights into the problem. In particular we show that L1 and L2 losses are, quite surprisingly, justified classification objectives for deep nets, by providing probabilistic interpretation in terms of expected misclassification. We also introduce two losses which are not typically used as deep nets objectives and show that they are viable alternatives to the existing ones.},

abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance - even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization schemes, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs, and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. For FNNs we considered (i) ReLU networks without normalization, (ii) batch normalization, (iii) layer normalization, (iv) weight normalization, (v) highway networks, and (vi) residual networks. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep.},

abstract = {Regularizing neural networks is an important task to reduce overfitting. Dropout [1] has been a widelyused regularization trick for neural networks. In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), dropout is usually applied to the fully connected layers. Meanwhile, the regularization effect of dropout in the convolutional layers has not been thoroughly analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we analyze the effect of dropout in the convolutional layers, which is indeed proved as a powerful generalization method. We observed that dropout in CNNs regularizes the networks by adding noise to the output feature maps of each layer, yielding robustness to variations of images. Based on this observation, we propose a stochastic dropout whose drop ratio varies for each iteration. Furthermore, we propose a new regularization method which is inspired by behaviors of image filters. Rather than randomly drop the activation, we selectively drop the activations which have high values across the feature map or across the channels. Experimental results validate the regularization performance of selective max-drop and stochastic dropout is competitive to the dropout or spatial dropout [2].},

abstract = {The Recurrent Neural Networks and their variants have shown promising performances in sequence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extractors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by factorizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained simultaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets and achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art models, even though our model architecture is orders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential data with RNN architectures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional sequential data.},

Hybrid speech recognition systems incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models (HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks. Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it feasible to train an 'end-to-end' speech recognition system instead of hybrid settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.},

The network employs the convolution theorem so as to cast convolutions in the spatial domain as products in the frequency domain. Moreover, the non-linearity in deep nets, often achieved by a rectifier unit, is here cast as a convolution in the frequency domain. This not only yields a network which is very computationally efficient at testing but also one whose parameters can all be learnt accordingly. The network can be trained using back propagation and is devoid of complex numbers due to the use of the Hartley transform as an alternative to the Fourier transform. Moreover, the network is potentially applicable to other problems elsewhere in computer vision and image processing which are often cast in the frequency domain. We show results on super-resolution and compare against alternatives elsewhere in the literature. In our experiments, our network is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the alternatives with an imperceptible loss of performance.},

abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks have shown impressive success in very different application caseS. Choosing a proper network architecture is a critical decision for a network's success, usually done in a manual manner. As a straightforward strategy, large, mostly fully connected architectures are selected, thereby relying on a good optimization strategy to find proper weights while at the same time avoiding overfitting. However, large parts of the final network are redundant. In the best case, large parts of the network become simply irrelevant for later inferencing. In the worst case, highly parameterized architectures hinder proper optimization and allow the easy creation of adverserial examples fooling the network. A first step in removing irrelevant architectural parts lies in identifying those parts, which requires measuring the contribution of individual components such as neuronS. In previous work, heuristics based on using the weight distribution of a neuron as contribution measure have shown some success, but do not provide a proper theoretical understanding. Therefore, in our work we investigate game theoretic measures, namely the shapley value (sV), in order to separate relevant from irrelevant parts of an artificial neural network. We begin by designing a coalitional game for an artificial neural network, where neurons form coalitions and the average contributions of neurons to coalitions yield to the shapley value. In order to measure how well the shapley value measures the contribution of individual neurons, we remove low-contributing neurons and measure its impact on the network performance. In our experiments we show that the shapley value outperforms other heuristics for measuring the contribution of neuronS.},

abstract = {Humans gain an implicit understanding of physical laws through observing and interacting with the world. Endowing an autonomous agent with an understanding of physical laws through experience and observation is seldom practical: we should seek alternatives. Fortunately, many of the laws of behaviour of the physical world can be derived from prior knowledge of dynamical systems, expressed through the use of partial differential equations. In this work, we suggest a neural network capable of understanding a specific physical phenomenon: wave propagation in a two-dimensional medium. We define “understanding” in this context as the ability to predict the future evolution of the spatial patterns of rendered wave amplitude from a relatively small set of initial observations. The inherent complexity of the wave equations – together with the existence of reflections and interference – makes the prediction problem non-trivial. A network capable of making approximate predictions also unlocks the opportunity to speed-up numerical simulations for wave propagation. To this aim, we created a novel dataset of simulated wave motion and built a predictive deep neural network comprising of three main blocks: an encoder, a propagator made by 3 LSTMs, and a decoder. Results show reasonable predictions for as long as 80 time steps into the future on a dataset not seen during training. Furthermore, the network is able to generalize to an initial condition that is qualitatively different from those seen during training1.},

For an arbitrary edge, we explicitly determine the change of the Kirchhoff index and express it in terms of the biharmonic distance between its end nodes, and thus call this centrality as biharmonic distance related centrality (BDRC). We show that BDRC has a better discriminating power than those commonly used metrics, such as edge betweenness and spanning edge centrality.

Because of the powerfulness of MLP and $ 1\times 1 $ convolutions in spatial domain, NiN has stronger ability of feature representation and hence results in better recognition performance. However, MLP itself consists of fully connected layers that give rise to a large number of parameters. In this paper, we propose to replace dense shallow MLP with sparse shallow MLP. One or more layers of the sparse shallow MLP are sparely connected in the channel dimension or channel-spatial domain. The proposed method is implemented by applying unshared convolution across the channel dimension and applying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational layers. The proposed method is called convolution in convolution (CiC). The experimental results on the CIFAR10 data set, augmented CIFAR10 data set, and CIFAR100 data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CiC method.},

abstract = {Programming by example (PBE) systems allow end users to easily create programs by providing a few input-output examples to specify their intended task. The system attempts to generate a program in a domain specific language (DSL) that satisfies the given examples. However, a key challenge faced by existing PBE techniques is to ensure the robustness of the programs that are synthesized from a small number of examples, as these programs often fail when applied to new inputs. This is because there can be many possible programs satisfying a small number of examples, and the PBE system has to somehow rank between these candidates and choose the correct one without any further information from the user. In this work we present a different approach to PBE in which the system avoids making a ranking decision at the synthesis stage, by instead synthesizing a disjunctive program that includes the many possible top-ranked programs as possible alternatives and selects between these different choices upon execution on a new input. This delayed choice brings the important benefit of comparing the possible outputs produced by the different disjuncts on a given input at execution time. We present a generic framework for synthesizing such disjunctive programs in arbitrary DSLs, and describe two concrete implementations of disjunctive synthesis in the practical domains of data extraction from plain text and HTML documents. We present an evaluation showing the significant increase in robustness achieved with our disjunctive approach, as illustrated by an increase from 59% to 93% of tasks for which correct programs can be learnt from a single example.},

Incorporating this in deep learning frameworks would allow us to explicitly encode known notions of geometry, instead of having the network implicitly learn them from data. However, performing eigendecomposition within a network requires the ability to differentiate this operation. Unfortunately, while theoretically doable, this introduces numerical instability in the optimization process in practice. In this paper, we introduce an eigendecomposition-free approach to training a deep network whose loss depends on the eigenvector corresponding to a zero eigenvalue of a matrix predicted by the network. We demonstrate on several tasks, including keypoint matching and 3D pose estimation, that our approach is much more robust than explicit differentiation of the eigendecomposition, It has better convergence properties and yields state-of-the-art results on both tasks.},

In recent years, while various methods that generate images of characters using GANs have been proposed, it is not yet possible for users to freely designate poses of human figures. When generating an image of a character, the pose of the character takes is an important component of its composition. Thus it is necessary fora user who wants to create an illustration to be able to specify the pose easily. We collected a set of illustrations of human figures from the internet, and for each illustration, a simple line drawing that specifies the pose was drawn manually. We constructed a GAN that takes a line drawing as its input and creates an illustration of a person in a pose that matches the line drawing. These networks are learned using the data set we prepared. In this paper, we propose a new network architecture. After constructing two networks both of which have almost the same structure as pix2pix, which is a variant model of GANs, we stack up those networks based on the idea of stack GAN. The experimental results show that, from stick figures representing common poses such as a standing pose, our methods was able to successfully generate images of characters. However, in the case of stick figures having rare poses that were not in the dataset, such as figures raising a hand or lying down, the generated images were blurred and not of a high-quality but still had the desired shapes. By expanding the dataset to include various poses, it is possible to generate diverse poses more precisely.},

abstract = {Impressive image captioning results (i.e., an objective description for an image) are achieved with plenty of training pairs. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate the creation of narrative paragraph for a photo stream. This task is even more challenging due to the difficulty in modeling an ordered photo sequence and in generating a relevant paragraph with expressive language style for storytelling. The difficulty can even be exacerbated by the limited training data, so that existing approaches almost focus on search-based solutions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a sequence-to-sequence modeling approach with reinforcement learning and adversarial training. First, to model the ordered photo stream, we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network as story generator, which is optimized by reinforcement learning with rewards. Second, to generate relevant and story-style paragraphs, we design the rewards with two critic networks, including a multi-modal and a language-style discriminator. Third, we further consider the story generator and reward critics as adversaries. The generator aims to create indistinguishable paragraphs to human-level stories, whereas the critics aim at distinguishing them and further improving the generator by policy gradient. Experiments on three widely-used datasets show the effectiveness, against state-of-the-art methods with relative increase of 20.2% by METEOR. We also show the subjective preference for the proposed approach over the baselines through a user study with 30 human subjects.},

abstract = {In big data fields, with increasing computing capability, artificial neural networks have shown great strength in solving data classification and regression problems. The traditional training of neural networks depends generally on the error back propagation method to iteratively tune all the parameters. When the number of hidden layers increases, this kind of training has many problems such as slow convergence, time consuming, and local minima. To avoid these problems, neural networks with random weights (NNRW) are proposed in which the weights between the hidden layer and input layer are randomly selected and the weights between the output layer and hidden layer are obtained analytically. Researchers have shown that NNRW has much lower training complexity in comparison with the traditional training of feed-forward neural networks. This paper objectively reviews the advantages and disadvantages of NNRW model, tries to reveal the essence of NNRW, gives our comments and remarks on NNRW, and provides some useful guidelines for users to choose a mechanism to train a feed-forward neural network.},

abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

Autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, model local structure but have slow iterative sampling and lack global latent structure. In contrast, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.1},

Here we present a deep learning framework for the prediction of the quantum mechanical wavefunction in a local basis of atomic orbitals from which all other ground-state properties can be derived. This approach retains full access to the electronic structure via the wavefunction at force-field-like efficiency and captures quantum mechanics in an analytically differentiable representation.

In this paper we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model able to understand the complex relationship between topology, routing and input traffic to produce accurate estimates of the per-source/destination pair mean delay and jitter. GNN are tailored to learn and model information structured as graphs and as a result, our model is able to generalize over arbitrary topologies, routing schemes and variable traffic intensity. In the paper we show that our model provides accurate estimates of delay and jitter (worst case R2 = 0.86) when testing against topologies, routing and traffic not seen during training. In addition, we present the potential of the model for network operation by presenting several use-cases that show its effective use in per-source/destination pair delay/jitter routing optimization and its generalization capabilities by reasoning in topologies and routing schemes not seen during training.},

The proposed model can intrinsically handle uncertainties in its inputs and self-estimate the confidence of its predictions. Using variational Bayesian inference and the central limit theorem, a fully deterministic loss function is derived, allowing it to be trained as efficiently as a conventional neural network using mini-batch gradient descent. The posterior distribution of activation functions is inferred from the training data alongside the weights of the network. The proposed model favorably compares to deep Gaussian processes, both in model complexity and efficiency of inference. It can be directly applied to recurrent or convolutional network structures, allowing its use in audio and image processing tasks. As an preliminary empirical evaluation we present experiments on regression and classification tasks, in which our model achieves performance comparable to or better than a Dropout regularized neural network with a fixed activation function.

We also pay special attention to non- Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, minibatches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

We introduce the notion of a computation skeleton, an acyclic graph that succinctly describes both a family of neural networks and a kernel space. Random neural networks are generated from a skeleton through node replication followed by sampling from a normal distribution to assign weights. The kernel space consists of functions that arise by compositions, averaging, and non-linear transformations governed by the skeleton's graph topology and activation functions. We prove that random networks induce representations which approximate the kernel space. In particular, it follows that random weight initialization often yields a favorable starting point for optimization despite the worst-case intractability of training neural networks.},

On the other hand, convergence to wfor one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least (1-e)/2 probability, if weights are initialized randomly with standard deviation upper-bounded by 0(e/\fd), consistent with empirical practice.

As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP.

Traditional interatomic potentials are based on physical intuition but contain few adjustable parameters and are usually not accurate. The emerging machine-learning (ML) potentials achieve highly accurate interpolation within a large DFT database but, being purely mathematical constructions, suffer from poor transferability to unknown structures. We propose a new approach that can drastically improve the transferability of ML potentials by informing them of the physical nature of interatomic bonding. This is achieved by combining a rather general physics-based model (analytical bond-order potential) with a neural-network regression. This approach, called the physically informed neural network (PINN) potential, is demonstrated by developing a general-purpose PINN potential for Al. We suggest that the development of physics-based ML potentials is the most effective way forward in the field of atomistic simulations.},

This can be challenging when the underlying model of the data is unknown.

Results: Using simulated data, we show that a genetic programming optimized neural network approach is able to model gene-gene interactions as well as a traditional back propagation neural network. Furthermore, the genetic programming optimized neural network is better than the traditional back propagation neural network approach in terms of predictive ability and power to detect gene-gene interactions when non-functional polymorphisms are present. Conclusion: This study suggests that a machine learning strategy for optimizing neural network architecture may be preferable to traditional trial-and-error approaches for the identification and characterization of gene-gene interactions in common, complex human diseases. {\textcopyright} 2003 Ritchie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Tsai2006,
abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network. The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Threshold functions and related operators are widely used as basic elements of adaptive and associative networks [Nakano 72, Amari 72, Hopfield 82]. There exist numerous learning rules for finding a set of weights to achieve a particular correspondence between input-output pairs. But early works in the field have shown that the number of threshold functions (or linearly separable functions) in N binary variables is small compared to the number of all possible boolean mappings in N variables, especially if N is large. This problem is one of the main limitations of most neural networks models where the state is fully specified by the environment during learning: they can only learn linearly separable functions of their inputs. Moreover, a learning procedure which requires the outside world to specify the state of every neuron during the learning session can hardly be considered as a general learning rule because in real-world conditions, only a partial information on the “ideal” network state for each task is available from the environment. It is possible to use a set of so-called “hidden units” [Hinton,Sejnowski,Ackley. 84], without direct interaction with the environment, which can compute intermediate predicates. Unfortunately, the global response depends on the output of a particular hidden unit in a highly non-linear way, moreover the nature of this dependence is influenced by the states of the other cells.},

@article{Bengio2014,
abstract = {We propose to exploit {\em reconstruction} as a layer-local training signal for deep learning. Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them, flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations.},

abstract = {Back-propagation has been the workhorse of recent successes of deep learning but it relies on infinitesimal effects (partial derivatives) in order to perform credit assignment. This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of non-linearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit assignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for the imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation, is very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results comparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous units and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic networks.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks are most commonly trained with the back-propagation algorithm, where the gradient for learning is provided by back-propagating the error, layer by layer, from the output layer to the hidden layers. A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the weights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with the weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact, random feedback weights work evenly well, because the network learns how to make the feedback useful. In this work, the feedback alignment principle is used for training hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network, and from a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random feedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This simple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional networks and very deep networks, completely without error back-propagation. The method is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the error signal is almost local, and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are required. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is almost as good as those obtained with back-propagation for fully connected networks. If combined with dropout, the method achieves 1.45% error on the permutation invariant MNIST task.},

abstract = {The brain processes information through multiple layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but complicates learning because it is difficult to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all the synaptic weights on each neuron's axon and further downstream. However, this involves a precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we demonstrate that this strong architectural constraint is not required for effective error propagation. We present a surprisingly simple mechanism that assigns blame by multiplying errors by even random synaptic weights. This mechanism can transmit teaching signals across multiple layers of neurons and performs as effectively as backpropagation on a variety of tasks. Our results help reopen questions about how the brain could use error signals and dispel long-held assumptions about algorithmic constraints on learning.},

abstract = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

This is largely because conventional optimization algorithms rely on stochastic gradient methods that don't scale well to large numbers of cores in a cluster setting. Furthermore, the convergence of all gradient methods, including batch methods, suffers from common problems like saturation effects, poor conditioning, and saddle points. This paper explores an unconventional training method that uses alternating direction methods and Bregman iteration to train networks without gradient descent steps. The proposed method reduces the network training problem to a sequence of minimization sub-steps that can each be solved globally in closed form. The proposed method is advantageous because it avoids many of the caveats that make gradient methods slow on highly non-convex problems. The method exhibits strong scaling in the distributed setting, yielding linear speedups even when split over thousands of cores.},

abstract = {Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagaling error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropa-gated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which arc decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass - amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

abstract = {We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well-defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point or stationary distribution) toward a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged toward their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal “back-propagated” during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanismsimilar to Backpropagation couldbe implementedby brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not. We also showexperimentally that multi-layer recurrently connected networks with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers can be trained by Equilibrium Propagation on the permutation-invariant MNIST task.},

abstract = {The way how recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons in the brain acquire powerful information processing capabilities through learning has remained a mystery. This lack of understanding is linked to a lack of learning algorithms for recurrent networks of spiking neurons (RSNNs) that are both functionally powerful and can be implemented by known biological mechanisms. Since RSNNs are simultaneously a primary target for implementations of brain-inspired circuits in neuromorphic hardware, this lack of algorithmic insight also hinders technological progress in that area. The gold standard for learning in recurrent neural networks in machine learning is back-propagation through time (BPTT), which implements stochastic gradient descent with regard to a given loss function. But BPTT is unrealistic from a biological perspective, since it requires a transmission of error signals backwards in time and in space, i.e., from post- to presynaptic neurons. We show that an online merging of locally available information during a computation with suitable top-down learning signals in real-time provides highly capable approximations to BPTT. For tasks where information on errors arises only late during a network computation, we enrich locally available information through feedforward eligibility traces of synapses that can easily be computed in an online manner. The resulting new generation of learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks provides a new understanding of network learning in the brain that can be tested experimentally. In addition, these algorithms provide efficient methods for on-chip training of RSNNs in neuromorphic hardware. We changed in this version 2 of the paper the name of the new learning algorithms to e-prop, corrected minor errors, added details – especially for resulting new rules for synaptic plasticity, edited the notation, and included new results for TIMIT.},

abstract = {Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) owe their success to training algorithms that use backpropagation and gradient-descent. Backpropagation, while highly effective on von Neumann architectures, becomes inefficient when scaling to large networks. Commonly referred to as the weight transport problem, each neuron's dependence on the weights and errors located deeper in the network require exhaustive data movement which presents a key problem in enhancing the performance and energy-efficiency of machine-learning hardware. In this work, we propose a bio-plausible alternative to backpropagation drawing from advances in feedback alignment algorithms in which the error computation at a single synapse reduces to the product of three scalar values. Using a sparse feedback matrix, we show that a neuron needs only a fraction of the information previously used by the feedback alignment algorithms. Consequently, memory and compute can be partitioned and distributed whichever way produces the most efficient forward pass so long as a single error can be delivered to each neuron. We evaluate our algorithm using standard datasets, including ImageNet, to address the concern of scaling to challenging problems. Our results show orders of magnitude improvement in data movement and 2× improvement in multiply-and-accumulate operations over backpropagation. Like previous work, we observe that any variant of feedback alignment suffers significant losses in classification accuracy on deep convolutional neural networks. By transferring trained convolutional layers and training the fully connected layers using direct feedback alignment, we demonstrate that direct feedback alignment can obtain results competitive with backpropagation. Furthermore, we observe that using an extremely sparse feedback matrix, rather than a dense one, results in a small accuracy drop while yielding hardware advantages.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin.

Despite the fact that the IMDB corpus is twice as large as the IMR corpus, and the Yelp sample contains almost twice as many reviews, we can construct a very good language model for the IMR corpus using inductive sequential transfer learning, specifically ULMFiT [8], as measured by the quality of text generation, as well as low perplexity (11.86) and high categorical accuracy (0.53) on unseen test data, compared to the larger Yelp and IMDB corpora (perplexity: 40.3 and 37, respectively; accuracy: 0.29 and 0.39). We see similar trends in topic models [17] and classification models predicting binary IMR outcomes and binarized sentiment for Yelp and IMDB reviews. We also examine four other corpora (drug reviews [6], data science job postings [9], legal case summaries [5] and cooking recipes [11]) to show that the IMR results are not typical for specialized-register corpora. These results indicate that movie and restaurant reviews exhibit a much larger variety, more contentful discussion, and greater attention to detail compared to IMR reviews, which points to the possibility that a crucial consumer protection mandated by law fails a sizeable class of highly vulnerable patients.},

abstract = {How to train a binary neural network (BinaryNet) with both high compression rate and high accuracy on large scale datasets? We answer this question through a careful analysis of previous work on BinaryNets, in terms of training strategies, regularization, and activation approximation. Our findings first reveal that a low learning rate is highly preferred to avoid frequent sign changes of the weights, which often makes the learning of BinaryNets unstable. Secondly, we propose to use PReLU instead of ReLU in a BinaryNet to conveniently absorb the scale factor for weights to the activation function, which enjoys high computation efficiency for binarized layers while maintains high approximation accuracy. Thirdly, we reveal that instead of imposing L2 regularization, driving all weights to zero which contradicts with the setting of BinaryNets, we introduce a regularization term that encourages the weights to be bipolar. Fourthly, we discover that the failure of binarizing the last layer, which is essential for high compression rate, is due to the improper output range. We propose to use a scale layer to bring it to normal. Last but not least, we propose multiple binarizations to improve the approximation of the activations. The composition of all these enables us to train BinaryNets with both high compression rate and high accuracy, which is strongly supported by our extensive empirical study.},

It has been known that using binary weights and activations drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and can replace arithmetic operations with more efficient bitwise operations, leading to much faster test-time inference and lower power consumption. However, previous works on binarizing CNNs usually result in severe prediction accuracy degradation. In this paper, we address this issue with two major innovations: (1) approximating full-precision weights with the linear combination of multiple binary weight bases; (2) employing multiple binary activations to alleviate information loss. The implementation of the resulting binary CNN, denoted as ABC-Net, is shown to achieve much closer performance to its full-precision counterpart, and even reach the comparable prediction accuracy on ImageNet and forest trail datasets, given adequate binary weight bases and activations.},

abstract = {Neural networks with deterministic binary weights using the Straight-Through-Estimator (STE) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results, but their training process is not well-founded. This is due to the discrepancy between the evaluated function in the forward path, and the weight updates in the back-propagation, updates which do not correspond to gradients of the forward path. Efficient convergence and accuracy of binary models often rely on careful fine-tuning and various ad-hoc techniques. In this work, we empirically identify and study the effectiveness of the various ad-hoc techniques commonly used in the literature, providing best-practices for efficient training of binary models. We show that adapting learning rates using second-moment methods is crucial for the successful use of the STE, and that other optimisers can easily get stuck in local minima. We also find that many of the commonly employed tricks are only effective towards the end of the training, with these methods making early stages of the training considerably slower. Our analysis disambiguates necessary from unnecessary ad-hoc techniques for the training of binary neural networks, paving the way for future development of solid theoretical foundations for these. Our newly-found insights further lead to new procedures which make training of existing binary neural networks notably faster.},

Moreover, it allows for anytime ensemble predictions for improved performance and uncertainty estimates by sampling from the weight distribution.

NN usually learns by examples. If NN is supplied with enough examples, it should be able to perform classification and even discover new trends or patterns in data. Basic NN is composed of three layers, input, output and hidden layer. Each layer can have number of nodes and nodes from input layer are connected to the nodes from hidden layer. Nodes from hidden layer are connected to the nodes from output layer. Those connections represent weights between nodes. This paper describes one of most popular NN algorithms, Back Propagation (BP) Algorithm. The aim is to show the logic behind this algorithm. Idea behind BP algorithm is quite simple, output of NN is evaluated against desired output. If results are not satisfactory, connection (weights) between layers are modified and process is repeated again and again until error is small enough. Simple BP example is demonstrated in this paper with NN architecture also covered. New implementation of BP algorithm are emerging and there are few parameters that could be changed to improve performance of BP.},

Over past fifteen years, a view has emerged that computing based on models inspired by our understanding of the structure and function of the biological neural networks may hold the key to the success of solving intelligent tasks by machines like noisy time series prediction and more[1]. A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor that has a natural propensity for storing experiential knowledge and making it available for use. It resembles the brain in two respects: Knowledge is acquired by the network through a learning process and interneuron connection strengths known as synaptic weights are used to store the knowledge[2]. Moreover, recently the Markets have become a more accessible investment tool, not only for strategic investors but for common people as well. Consequently they are not only related to macroeconomic parameters, but they influence everyday life in a more direct way. Therefore they constitute a mechanism which has important and direct social impacts. The characteristic that all Stock Markets have in common is the uncertainty, which is related with their short and long-term future state. This feature is undesirable for the investor but it is also unavoidable whenever the Stock Market is selected as the investment tool. The best that one can do is to try to reduce this uncertainty. Stock Market Prediction (or Forecasting) is one of the instruments in this process. We cannot exactly predict what will happen tomorrow, but from previous experiences we can roughly predict tomorrow. In this paper this knowledge based approach is taken. The accuracy of the predictive system which is made by ANN can be tuned with help of different network architectures. Network is consists of input layer ,hidden layer & output layer of neuron, no of neurons per layer can be configured according to the needed result accuracy & throughput,there is no cut & bound rule for that.the network can be trained by using sample training data set,this neural network model is very much useful for mapping unknown functional dependencies between different input & output tuples.In this paper two types of neural network architecture,feed forward multilayer network & timedelay recurrent network is used for the prediction of the NASDAQ stock price.A comparative error study for both network architecture is introduced in this paper.},

abstract = {Background: The purpose of this investigation was to compare empirically predictive ability of an artificial neural network with a logistic regression in prediction of low back pain. Methods: Data from the second national health survey were considered in this investigation. This data includes the information of low back pain and its associated risk factors among Iranian people aged 15 years and older. Artificial neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a set of 17294 data and they were validated in a test set of 17295 data. Hosmer and Lemeshow recommendation for model selection was used in fitting the logistic regression. A three-layer perceptron with 9 inputs, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons was employed. The efficiency of two models was compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, root mean square and -2 Loglikelihood criteria. Results: The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the logistic regression was 0.752 (0.004), 0.3832 and 14769.2, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the artificial neural network was 0.754 (0.004), 0.3770 and 14757.6, respectively. Conclusions: Based on these three criteria, artificial neural network would give better performance than logistic regression. Although, the difference is statistically significant, it does not seem to be clinically significant.},

The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths, the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together, sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size.

Extensive psychological evidence shows that humans prefer to conduct evaluations qualitatively rather than numer-ically. The qualitative evaluations are then converted into the numerical scores to fairly benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. Recently, lots of learning-based IQA models are proposed by analyzing the mapping from the images to numerical ratings. However, the learnt mapping can hardly be accurate enough because some information has been lost in such an irreversible conversion from the linguistic descriptions to numerical scores. In this paper, we propose a blind IQA model, which learns qualitative evaluations directly and outputs numeri-cal scores for general utilization and fair comparison. Images are represented by natural scene statistics features. A discriminative deep model is trained to classify the features into five grades, corresponding to five explicit mental concepts, i.e., excellent, good, fair, poor, and bad. A newly designed quality pooling is then applied to convert the qualitative labels into scores. The classification framework is not only much more natural than the regression-based models, but also robust to the small sample size problem. Thorough experiments are conducted on popular databases to verify the model's effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.

abstract = {Deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations are currently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN). The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activation functions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with the use of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classification of similar input examples. During the training process, these subnetworks avoid overfitting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they must share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we have made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance of such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial distribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear activation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear activation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can result in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions. Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial distribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the introduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these activation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with a relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch normalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models. We show that by introducing maxout and batch normalisation units to the network in network model results in a model that produces classification results that are better than or comparable to the current state of the art in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets.},

abstract = {Deep learning has been found to be vulnerable to changes in the data distribution. This means that inputs that have an imperceptibly and immeasurably small difference from training data correspond to a completely different class label in deep learning. Thus an existing deep learning network like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is vulnerable to adversarial examples. We design an adversarial learning algorithm for supervised learning in general and CNNs in particular. Adversarial examples are generated by a game theoretic formulation on the performance of deep learning. In the game, the interaction between an intelligent adversary and deep learning model is a two-person sequential noncooperative Stackelberg game with stochastic payoff functions. The Stackelberg game is solved by the Nash equilibrium which is a pair of strategies (learner weights and genetic operations) from which there is no incentive for either learner or adversary to deviate. The algorithm performance is evaluated under different strategy spaces on MNIST handwritten digits data. We show that the Nash equilibrium leads to solutions robust to subsequent adversarial data manipulations.

abstract = {Deep learning techniques for Sentiment Analysis have become very popular. They provide automatic feature extraction and both richer representation capabilities and better performance than traditional feature based techniques (i.e., surface methods). Traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. These long-established approaches can yield strong baselines, and their predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising deep learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of deep learning techniques integrating them with traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are sixfold. First, we develop a deep learning based sentiment classifier using a word embeddings model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on F1-Score.},

abstract = {Relatively small data sets available for expression recognition research make the training of deep networks very challenging. Although fine-tuning can partially alleviate the issue, the performance is still below acceptable levels as the deep features probably contain redundant information from the pretrained domain. In this paper, we present FaceNet2ExpNet, a novel idea to train an expression recognition network based on static images. We first propose a new distribution function to model the high-level neurons of the expression network. Based on this, a two-stage training algorithm is carefully designed. In the pre-training stage, we train the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In the refining stage, we append fully-connected layers to the pre-trained convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly. Visualization results show that the model trained with our method captures improved high-level expression semantics. Evaluations on four public expression databases, CK+, Oulu- CASIA, TFD, and SFEW demonstrate that our method achieves better results than state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Several recent works have used deep convolutional networks to generate realistic imagery. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to scribble over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach generates more realistic, diverse, and controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.},

abstract = {Street traffic sign infrastructure remains an extremely difficult asset for local government to manage due to its diverse physical structure and geographical distribution. A spatial registrar of traffic infrastructure is currently a required component of local government councils' mandatory road management plans. Recent advancements of object detection technology in machine learning have presented an automated approach for the detection and classification of street signage captured by Google's Street View (GSV) imagery. This paper explores the possibility of using deep learning to produce an autonomous system for detecting traffic signs on GSV images to assist in traffic assets monitoring and maintenance. By leveraging Google's Street View API, this research offers an economic approach of building purposeful street sign computer vision datasets. A custom object detection model was trained to detect and classify Stop and Give Way signs from images captured at intersection approaches. Considering the output detected bounding box coordinates, photogrammetry approach was applied to calculate the approximate location of each detected sign in two-dimensional geographical space. The newly located and classified street signs can be combined with relevant spatial data for implementation into an asset management system. By combining GIS and the GSV API, the process is completely scalable to any level of street sign classification scope. The experiments conducted on the road network of study area recorded a detection accuracy of 95.63% and classification accuracy of 97.82%. Our proposed automated approach to the detection and localisation of street sign infrastructure has displayed a promising potential for its use by local government authorities. Our workflow can be used to detect other traffic signs and applied to other road sections and other cities. Of primary importance, this approach takes an entirely free and open-source approach throughout. The continuation of Google's Street View program will account for the spatiotemporal representation of street sign infrastructure for the ongoing maintenance and renewal programs of this valuable asset.},

However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},

abstract = {Recently, pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have outperformed traditional acoustic models based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on a variety of large vocabulary speech recognition benchmarks. Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random 'dropout' procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system.

We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task.

Empirical evaluation on real-life datasets (images and text), as well as on synthetic data, demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art non-adaptive online sparse coding of [Mairal et al., 2009] in the presence of non-stationary data.

abstract = {We introduce a data-driven approach for unsupervised video retargeting that translates content from one domain to another while preserving the style native to a domain, i.e., if contents of John Oliver's speech were to be transferred to Stephen Colbert, then the generated content/speech should be in Stephen Colbert's style. Our approach combines both spatial and temporal information along with adversarial losses for content translation and style preservation. In this work, we first study the advantages of using spatiotemporal constraints over spatial constraints for effective retargeting. We then demonstrate the proposed approach for the problems where information in both space and time matters such as face-to-face translation, flower-to-flower, wind and cloud synthesis, sunrise and sunset.},

abstract = {A food recipe is an ordered set of instructions for preparing a particular dish. From a visual perspective, every instruction step can be seen as a way to change the visual appearance of the dish by adding extra objects (e.g., adding an ingredient) or changing the appearance of the existing ones (e.g., cooking the dish). In this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by building a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure. To do so, we learn composable module operations which are able to either add or remove a particular ingredient. Each operator is designed as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Given only weak image-level supervision, the operators are trained to generate a visual layer that needs to be added to or removed from the existing image. The proposed model is able to decompose an image into an ordered sequence of layers by applying sequentially in the right order the corresponding removing modules. Experimental results on synthetic and real pizza images demonstrate that our proposed model is able to: (1) segment pizza toppings in a weakly-supervised fashion, (2) remove them by revealing what is occluded underneath them (i.e., inpainting), and (3) infer the ordering of the toppings without any depth ordering supervision. Code, data, and models are available online.},

abstract = {A new architecture of deep neural networks, directed acyclic graph convolutional neural networks (DAG-CNNs), is used to classify heartbeats from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into different subject-based classes. DAG-CNNs not only fuse the feature extraction and classification stages of the ECG classification into a single automated learning procedure, but also utilized multi-scale features and perform score-level fusion of multiple classifiers automatically. Therefore, DAG-CNN negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted features. In most of the current approaches, only the high level features which extracted by the last layer of CNN are used. Instead of performing feature level fusion manually and feeding the results into a classifier, the proposed multi-scale system can automatically learn different level of features, combine them and predict the output label. The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmarks database demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a superior classification performance compared to most of the state-of-the-art methods.},

@article{Joyce2010,
abstract = {Recent developments in network theory have allowed for the study of the structure and function of the human brain in terms of a network of interconnected components. Among the many nodes that form a network, some play a crucial role and are said to be central within the network structure. Central nodes may be identified via centrality metrics, with degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality being three of the most popular measures. Degree identifies the most connected nodes, whereas betweenness centrality identifies those located on the most traveled paths. Eigenvector centrality considers nodes connected to other high degree nodes as highly central. In the work presented here, we propose a new centrality metric called leverage centrality that considers the extent of connectivity of a node relative to the connectivity of its neighbors. The leverage centrality of a node in a network is determined by the extent to which its immediate neighbors rely on that node for information. Although similar in concept, there are essential differences between eigenvector and leverage centrality that are discussed in this manuscript. Degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and leverage centrality were compared using functional brain networks generated from healthy volunteers. Functional cartography was also used to identify neighborhood hubs (nodes with high degree within a network neighborhood). Provincial hubs provide structure within the local community, and connector hubs mediate connections between multiple communities. Leverage proved to yield information that was not captured by degree, betweenness, or eigenvector centrality and was more accurate at identifying neighborhood hubs. We propose that this metric may be able to identify critical nodes that are highly influential within the network. {\textcopyright} 2010 Joyce et al.},

Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of L0regularization. However, since the L0norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected L0regularized objective is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the hard concrete distribution for the gates, which is obtained by "stretching" a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

abstract = {Singing voice synthesis techniques have been proposed based on a hidden Markov model (HMM). In these approaches, the spectrum, excitation, and duration of singing voices are simultaneously modeled with context-dependent HMMs and waveforms are generated from the HMMs themselves. However, the quality of the synthesized singing voices still has not reached that of natural singing voices. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have largely improved on conventional approaches in various research areas including speech recognition, image recognition, speech synthesis, etc. The DNN-based text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis can synthesize high quality speech. In the DNN-based TTS system, a DNN is trained to represent the mapping function from contextual features to acoustic features, which are modeled by decision tree-clustered context dependent HMMs in the HMM-based TTS system. In this paper, we propose singing voice synthesis based on a DNN and evaluate its effectiveness. The relationship between the musical score and its acoustic features is modeled in frames by a DNN. For the sparseness of pitch context in a database, a musical-note-level pitch normalization and linear-interpolation techniques are used to prepare the excitation features. Subjective experimental results show that the DNN-based system outperformed the HMM-based system in terms of naturalness.},

The contents of both the input layer and the set of training data have been optimized through genetic search in order to maximize the accuracy of the network. The output of the network is improved upon with a local heuristic hill-climber (HC). We implement this model in an existing system for generating guitar arrangements via genetic algorithm (GA). When compared to the original system for generating tablature, we note modest improvement in tablature quality and drastic improvements in execution time.},

abstract = {In this paper a new approach for polyphonic piano note onset transcription is presented. It is based on a recurrent neural network to simultaneously detect the onsets and the pitches of the notes from spectral features. Long Short-Term Mem-ory units are used in a bidirectional neural network to model the context of the notes. The use of a single regression out-put layer instead of the often used one-versus-all classifica-tion approach enables the system to significantly lower the number of erroneous note detections. Evaluation is based on common test sets and shows exceptional temporal preci-sion combined with a significant boost in note transcription performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. The system is trained jointly with various synthesized piano instruments and real piano recordings and thus generalizes much better than existing systems.},

abstract = {Automatic drum transcription (ADT) systems attempt to generate a symbolic music notation for percussive instruments in audio recordings. Neural networks have already been shown to perform well in fields related to ADT such as source separation and onset detection due to their utilisation of time-series data in classification. We propose the use of neural networks for ADT in order to exploit their ability to capture a complex configuration of features associated with individual or combined drum classes. In this paper we present a bi-directional recurrent neural network for offline detection of percussive onsets from specified drum classes and a recurrent neural network suitable for online operation. In both systems, a separate network is trained to identify onsets for each drum class under observation—that is, kick drum, snare drum, hi-hats, and combinations thereof. We perform four evaluations utilising the IDMT-SMT-Drums and ENST minus one datasets, which cover solo percussion and polyphonic audio respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods for solo percussion and a capacity for identifying snare drums, which are historically the most difficult drum class to detect.},

Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that (1) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes/neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes/neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc.). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; (2) ELM is proposed for both generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward network and multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks (including biological neural networks); (3) homogeneous architecture-based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary/multi-class) classification. (4) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks either.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, the feedforward neural network (FNN) optimization has been a key interest among the researchers and practitioners of multiple disciplines. The FNN optimization is often viewed from the various perspectives: the optimization of weights, network architecture, activation nodes, learning parameters, learning environment, etc. Researchers adopted such different viewpoints mainly to improve the FNN's generalization ability. The gradient-descent algorithm such as backpropagation has been widely applied to optimize the FNNs. Its success is evident from the FNN's application to numerous real-world problems. However, due to the limitations of the gradient-based optimization methods, the metaheuristic algorithms including the evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., are still being widely explored by the researchers aiming to obtain generalized FNN for a given problem. This article attempts to summarize a broad spectrum of FNN optimization methodologies including conventional and metaheuristic approaches. This article also tries to connect various research directions emerged out of the FNN optimization practices, such as evolving neural network (NN), cooperative coevolution NN, complex-valued NN, deep learning, extreme learning machine, quantum NN, etc. Additionally, it provides interesting research challenges for future research to cope-up with the present information processing era.},

We pursue a careful exploration of approaches to allow pooling to learn and to adapt to complex and variable patterns. The two primary directions lie in (1) learning a pooling function via (two strategies of) combining of max and average pooling, and (2) learning a pooling function in the form of a tree-structured fusion of pooling filters that are themselves learned. In our experiments every generalized pooling operation we explore improves performance when used in place of average or max pooling. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pooling operations provide a boost in invariance properties relative to conventional pooling and set the state of the art on several widely adopted benchmark datasets; they are also easy to implement, and can be applied within various deep neural network architectures. These benefits come with only a light increase in computational overhead during training and a very modest increase in the number of model parameters.},

abstract = {The neural network paradigm has been gaining recognition in geophysics as an alternative approach to solving various problems, especially those associated with pattern recognition and prediction tasks. Most of the work that has been done uses some form of back-propagation algorithm. A back-propagation network is simple and easy to implement. However, it learns too slowly for many real-life, non-trivial applications and lends to scale up poorly as the problem gels larger and more complex. It is also prone to getting trapped in local minima on the error surface. This sludy evaluates the performance of the cascade-correlation learning architecture in first break picking and automatic trace editing tasks. Empirical results show that, in comparison to the back-propagation mcthod, cascade correlation learning enables us to achieve a 10 to 50-foldspcedup in both tasks without getting trapped in local minima. Since cascade-correlation is a dynamic learning process, the size of the net obtained aller the learning session is guaranteed to be nearly optimal. Unlike back-propagation, a cascade-correlation net can be trained Incrementally while retaining most of the knowledge from its previous training session. Therefore, a large training data set can be broken up into smaller pieces and training can be cumulative.},

OBS also represents a major improvement over other methods, such as Optimal Brain Damage [Le Cun, Denker and Solla, 1990], because ours uses the full off-diagonal information of the Hessian matrix H. Crucial to OBS is a recursion relation for calculating H-1 from training data and structural information of the net. We illustrate OBS on standard benchmark problems — the MONK's problems. The most successful method in a recent competition in machine learning [Thrun et al., 1991] was backpropagation using weight decay, which yielded a network with 58 weights for one MONK's problem. OBS requires only 14 weights for the same performance accuracy. On two other MONK's problems, our method required only 38% and 10% of the weights found by magnitude-based pruning.},

Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9× to 13×; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35×, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49× from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3× to 4× layerwise speedup and 3× to 7× better energy efficiency.},

In this work, we explore the use of deep rectifier networks as acoustic models for the 300 hour Switchboard conversational speech recognition task. Using simple training procedures without pretraining, networks with rectifier nonlinearities produce 2% absolute reductions in word error rates over their sigmoidal counterparts. We analyze hidden layer representations to quantify differences in how ReL units encode inputs as compared to sigmoidal units.

abstract = {It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: 1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and 2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these traditional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on realworld benchmarking function approximation and classification problems including large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce best generalization performance in some cases and can learn much faster than traditional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks play an increasingly important role in computer vision tasks, especially in the field of visual object recognition. Many prominent models, such as Inception, Maxout, ResNet, and NIN, have been proposed to significantly improve recognition performance. Inspired from those models, we propose a novel module called self-adaptive module (SAM). SAM consists of four passes and one selector. Specifically, the four passes include two direct passes with different receptive fields and depths, one residual pass, and one Maxout pass. Actually, the residual pass is used to speed up convergence, while we take advantage of the Maxout pass to enhance approximate capabilities of SAM. The selector is further designed to help choose reasonable output. Basically, SAM is intended to simplify design of any new deep learning architecture, since it no longer requires consideration of how to select receptive fields and depths. Our SAM is tested on the visual object recognition datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN. The experimental results demonstrate that the SAM-Net has superior recognition performances on the four benchmarks, which achieve test errors of 5.76%, 28.56%, 0.31%, and 1.98%, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which first classifies sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we find that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to first apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classification datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classification can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.},

Nonetheless, compared to modeling waveform directly, ways of effectively handling higher-dimensional outputs, multiple feature streams and regularization become more important with our approach.

At the feature composing stage, we propose a novel composing method, based on Korean syllable structure. At the synthesis stage, we adopt LSTM-RNN for the SVS.

Crucially, the system is able to initialize the parameters of both the generator and the discriminator in a person-specific way, so that training can be based on just a few images and done quickly, despite the need to tune tens of millions of parameters. We show that such an approach is able to learn highly realistic and personalized talking head models of new people and even portrait paintings.},

The ByteNet is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive field. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time.

abstract = {Nearly all neuronal information processing and interneuronal communication in the brain involves action potentials, or spikes, which drive the short-term synaptic dynamics of neurons, but also their long-term dynamics, via synaptic plasticity. In many brain structures, action potential activity is considered to be sparse. This sparseness of activity has been exploited to reduce the computational cost of large-scale network simulations, through the development of event-driven simulation schemes. However, existing event-driven simulations schemes use extremely simplified neuronal models. Here, we implement and evaluate critically an event-driven algorithm (ED-LUT) that uses precalculated look-up tables to characterize synaptic and neuronal dynamics. This approach enables the use of more complex (and realistic) neuronal models or data in representing the neurons, while retaining the advantage of high-speed simulation. We demonstrate the method's application for neurons containing exponential synaptic conductances, thereby implementing shunting inhibition, a phenomenon that is critical to cellular computation. We also introduce an improved two-stage event-queue algorithm, which allows the simulations to scale efficiently to highly connected networks with arbitrary propagation delays.

@article{Tavanaei2019,
abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, for computer vision in particular. In this approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation. Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power, neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking neurons' transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many fewer operations and are the better candidates to process spatio-temporal data.},

abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inspired by information processing in biology, where sparse and asynchronous binary signals are communicated and processed in a massively parallel fashion. SNNs on neuromorphic hardware exhibit favorable properties such as low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven information processing. This makes them interesting candidates for the efficient implementation of deep neural networks, the method of choice for many machine learning tasks. In this review, we address the opportunities that deep spiking networks offer and investigate in detail the challenges associated with training SNNs in a way that makes them competitive with conventional deep learning, but simultaneously allows for efficient mapping to hardware. A wide range of training methods for SNNs is presented, ranging from the conversion of conventional deep networks into SNNs, constrained training before conversion, spiking variants of backpropagation, and biologically motivated variants of STDP. The goal of our review is to define a categorization of SNN training methods, and summarize their advantages and drawbacks. We further discuss relationships between SNNs and binary networks, which are becoming popular for efficient digital hardware implementation. Neuromorphic hardware platforms have great potential to enable deep spiking networks in real-world applications. We compare the suitability of various neuromorphic systems that have been developed over the past years, and investigate potential use cases. Neuromorphic approaches and conventional machine learning should not be considered simply two solutions to the same classes of problems, instead it is possible to identify and exploit their task-specific advantages. Deep SNNs offer great opportunities to work with new types of event-based sensors, exploit temporal codes and local on-chip learning, and we have so far just scratched the surface of realizing these advantages in practical applications.},

Our network that employs neurons operating at sparse biological spike rates below 300Hz achieves a classification accuracy of 98.17% on the MNIST test database with four times fewer parameters compared to the state-of-the-art. We present several insights from extensive numerical experiments regarding optimization of learning parameters and network configuration to improve its accuracy. We also describe a number of strategies to optimize the SNN for implementation in memory and energy constrained hardware, including approximations in computing the neuronal dynamics and reduced precision in storing the synaptic weights. Experiments reveal that even with 3-bit synaptic weights, the classification accuracy of the designed SNN does not degrade beyond 1% as compared to the floating-point baseline. Further, the proposed SNN, which is trained based on the precise spike timing information outperforms an equivalent non-spiking artificial neural network (ANN) trained using back propagation, especially at low bit precision. Thus, our study shows the potential for realizing efficient neuromorphic systems that use spike based information encoding and learning for real-world applications.},

@article{Kheradpisheh2018,
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be used in spiking neural networks (SNN) to extract visual features of low or intermediate complexity in an unsupervised manner. These studies, however, used relatively shallow architectures, and only one layer was trainable. Another line of research has demonstrated – using rate-based neural networks trained with back-propagation – that having many layers increases the recognition robustness, an approach known as deep learning. We thus designed a deep SNN, comprising several convolutional (trainable with STDP) and pooling layers. We used a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, and less activated neurons fire later or not at all. The network was exposed to natural images. Thanks to STDP, neurons progressively learned features corresponding to prototypical patterns that were both salient and frequent. Only a few tens of examples per category were required and no label was needed. After learning, the complexity of the extracted features increased along the hierarchy, from edge detectors in the first layer to object prototypes in the last layer. Coding was very sparse, with only a few thousands spikes per image, and in some cases the object category could be reasonably well inferred from the activity of a single higher-order neuron. More generally, the activity of a few hundreds of such neurons contained robust category information, as demonstrated using a classifier on Caltech 101, ETH-80, and MNIST databases. We also demonstrate the superiority of STDP over other unsupervised techniques such as random crops (HMAX) or auto-encoders. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of STDP with latency coding may be a key to understanding the way that the primate visual system learns, its remarkable processing speed and its low energy consumption. These mechanisms are also interesting for artificial vision systems, particularly for hardware solutions.},

Our experiments demonstrate that-without labels-WaveGAN learns to produce intelligible words when trained on a smallvocabulary speech dataset, and can also synthesize audio from other domains such as drums, bird vocalizations, and piano. We compare WaveGAN to a method which applies GANs designed for image generation on image-like audio feature representations, finding both approaches to be promising.},

The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches (e.g., the Kohonen feature map) is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process that also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method that results from the combination of the above-mentioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible-in contrast to earlier approaches-to perform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks that generalize very well. Results on the two-spirals benchmark and a vowel classification problem are presented that are better than any results previously published. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

abstract = {To achieve general intelligence, agents must learn how to interact with others in a shared environment: this is the challenge of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). The simplest form is independent reinforcement learning (InRL), where each agent treats its experience as part of its (non-stationary) environment. In this paper, we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit to the other agents' policies during training, failing to sufficiently generalize during execution. We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle, and fictitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings: gridworld coordination games and poker.},

abstract = {A longstanding goal in character animation is to combine data-driven specification of behavior with a system that can execute a similar behavior in a physical simulation, thus enabling realistic responses to perturbations and environmental variation. We show that well-known reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be adapted to learn robust control policies capable of imitating a broad range of example motion clips, while also learning complex recoveries, adapting to changes in morphology, and accomplishing userspecified goals. Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills. We demonstrate results using multiple characters (human, Atlas robot, bipedal dinosaur, dragon) and a large variety of skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.},

abstract = {The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has guided research on social dilemmas for decades. However, it distinguishes between only two atomic actions: cooperate and defect. In real-world prisoner's dilemmas, these choices are temporally extended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions, reflecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner's Dilemma (SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work, we propose a deep multiagent reinforcement learning approach that investigates the evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two phases. The first phase is offline: it synthesizes policies with different cooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The second phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the detected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the Apple-Pear game and the Fruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid being exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with cooperative opponents.},

@article{Bakkalbasi2006,
abstract = {Background: Researchers turn to citation tracking to find the most influential articles for a particular topic and to see how often their own published papers are cited. For years researchers looking for this type of information had only one resource to consult: the Web of Science from Thomson Scientific. In 2004 two competitors emerged - Scopus from Elsevier and Google Scholar from Google. The research reported here uses citation analysis in an observational study examining these three databases; comparing citation counts for articles from two disciplines (oncology and condensed matter physics) and two years (1993 and 2003) to test the hypothesis that the different scholarly publication coverage provided by the three search tools will lead to different citation counts from each. Methods: Eleven journal titles with varying impact factors were selected from each discipline (oncology and condensed matter physics) using the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). All articles published in the selected titles were retrieved for the years 1993 and 2003, and a stratified random sample of articles was chosen, resulting in four sets of articles. During the week of November 7-12, 2005, the citation counts for each research article were extracted from the three sources. The actual citing references for a subset of the articles published in 2003 were also gathered from each of the three sources. Results: For oncology 1993 Web of Science returned the highest average number of citations, 45.3. Scopus returned the highest average number of citations (8.9) for oncology 2003. Web of Science returned the highest number of citations for condensed matter physics 1993 and 2003 (22.5 and 3.9 respectively). The data showed a significant difference in the mean citation rates between all pairs of resources except between Google Scholar and Scopus for condensed matter physics 2003. For articles published in 2003 Google Scholar returned the largest amount of unique citing material for oncology and Web of Science returned the most for condensed matter physics. Conclusion: This study did not identify any one of these three resources as the answer to all citation tracking needs. Scopus showed strength in providing citing literature for current (2003) oncology articles, while Web of Science produced more citing material for 2003 and 1993 condensed matter physics, and 1993 oncology articles. All three tools returned some unique material. Our data indicate that the question of which tool provides the most complete set of citing literature may depend on the subject and publication year of a given article. {\textcopyright} 2006 Bakkalbasi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We compared the content coverage and practical utility of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The official Web pages of the databases were used to extract information on the range of journals covered, search facilities and restrictions, and update frequency. We used the example of a keyword search to evaluate the usefulness of these databases in biomedical information retrieval and a specific published article to evaluate their utility in performing citation analysis. All databases were practical in use and offered numerous search facilities. PubMed and Google Scholar are accessed for free. The keyword search with PubMed offers optimal update frequency and includes online early articles; other databases can rate articles by number of citations, as an index of importance. For citation analysis, Scopus offers about 20% more coverage than Web of Science, whereas Google Scholar offers results of inconsistent accuracy. PubMed remains an optimal tool in biomedical electronic research. Scopus covers a wider journal range, of help both in keyword searching and citation analysis, but it is currently limited to recent articles (published after 1995) compared with Web of Science. Google Scholar, as for the Web in general, can help in the retrieval of even the most obscure information but its use is marred by inadequate, less often updated, citation information.},

This paper also discusses the usability of centrality measures in author ranking, and suggests that centrality measures can be useful indicators for impact analysis. Findings revealed that scientometrics was not dominated by a couple of key researchers as quite a significant number of popular researchers were identified. The United States occupies the topmost position in all measures except for degree centrality.

abstract = {Purpose - The research aim for this study was to compare three citation resources with one another to identify the citation resource with the most representative South African scholarly environmental sciences citation coverage. This paper focuses on the results of the content verification process which measured amongst others the citation counts, multiple copies and inconsistencies encountered across the three citation resources ISI Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. Design/methodology/approach - The research, the first phase of a longitudinal study, used a comparative research design method with a purposive, non-probability sample. Data from the South African scholarly environmental sciences journals for the year range 2004-2008 (first phase) were extracted from the three citation resources and compared. Findings - It became evident during the verification process that the citation resources retrieved varied results. The total citation counts indicated that ISI Web of Science (WOS) retrieved the most citation results, followed by Google Scholar (GS) and then Scopus. WOS performed the best with total coverage of the journal sample population and also retrieved the most unique items. The investigation into multiple copies indicated that WOS and Scopus retrieved no duplicates, while GS retrieved multiple copies. Scopus delivered the least inconsistencies regarding content verification and content quality compared to the other two citation resources. Additionally, GS also retrieved the most inconsistencies, with WOS retrieving more inconsistencies than Scopus. Examples of these inconsistencies include author spelling and sequence, volume and issue number. Originality/value - The findings of the study contribute to the understanding of the completeness of citation results retrieved from different citation resources. In addition it will raise awareness amongst academics to check citations of their work. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) are prominent citation services with distinct indexing mechanisms. Comprehensive knowledge about the growth patterns of these two citation services is lacking. We analyzed the development of citation counts in WoS and GS for two classic articles and 56 articles from diverse research fields, making a distinction between retroactive growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in mid-2005 and citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013) and actual growth (i.e., the relative difference between citation counts up to mid-2005 measured in April 2013 and citation counts up to April 2013 measured in April 2013). One of the classic articles was used for a citation-by-citation analysis. Results showed that GS has substantially grown in a retroactive manner (median of 170 % across articles), especially for articles that initially had low citations counts in GS as compared to WoS. Retroactive growth of WoS was small, with a median of 2 % across articles. Actual growth percentages were moderately higher for GS than for WoS (medians of 54 vs. 41 %). The citation-by-citation analysis showed that the percentage of citations being unique in WoS was lower for more recent citations (6.8 % for citations from 1995 and later vs. 41 % for citations from before 1995), whereas the opposite was noted for GS (57 vs. 33 %). It is concluded that, since its inception, GS has shown substantial expansion, and that the majority of recent works indexed in WoS are now also retrievable via GS. A discussion is provided on quantity versus quality of citations, threats for WoS, weaknesses of GS, and implications for literature research and research evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Akad{\'{e}}miai Kiad{\'{o}}, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract = {The analysis of bibliometric networks, such as co-authorship, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation networks, has received a considerable amount of attention. Much less attention has been paid to the construction of these networks. We point out that different approaches can be taken to construct a bibliometric network. Normally the full counting approach is used, but we propose an alternative fractional counting approach. The basic idea of the fractional counting approach is that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a publication, should have equal weight, regardless of for instance the number of authors, citations, or references of a publication. We present two empirical analyses in which the full and fractional counting approaches yield very different results. These analyses deal with co-authorship networks of universities and bibliographic coupling networks of journals. Based on theoretical considerations and on the empirical analyses, we conclude that for many purposes the fractional counting approach is preferable over the full counting one.

Based on a sample of 146 senior academics in five broad disciplinary areas, we therefore provide both a longitudinal and a cross-disciplinary comparison of the three databases. Our longitudinal comparison of eight data points between 2013 and 2015 shows a consistent and reasonably stable quarterly growth for both publications and citations across the three databases. This suggests that all three databases provide sufficient stability of coverage to be used for more detailed cross-disciplinary comparisons. Our cross-disciplinary comparison of the three databases includes four key research metrics (publications, citations, h-index, and hI, annual, an annualised individual h-index) and five major disciplines (Humanities, Social Sciences, Engineering, Sciences and Life Sciences). We show that both the data source and the specific metrics used change the conclusions that can be drawn from cross-disciplinary comparisons.},

abstract = {Bibliometric methods are used in multiple fields for a variety of purposes, namely for research evaluation. Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus. The objective of this research is to describe the journal coverage of those two databases and to assess whether some field, publishing country and language are over or underrepresented. To do this we compared the coverage of active scholarly journals in WoS (13,605 journals) and Scopus (20,346 journals) with Ulrich's extensive periodical directory (63,013 journals). Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduce biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. These results imply that in the context of comparative research evaluation, WoS and Scopus should be used with caution, especially when comparing different fields, institutions, countries or languages. The bibliometric community should continue its efforts to develop methods and indicators that include scientific output that are not covered in WoS or Scopus, such as field-specific and national citation indexes.},

In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%-38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage.},

The investigation is based on the CAplus database of Chemical Abstracts Service, the INSPEC database of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Web of Science (WoS) of Thomson Reuters. The time evolution of the publications shows a dramatic increase since 2004 when graphene has been isolated for the first time. The graphene literature has been analyzed with respect to the most productive authors, research organizations, countries of authors, and the leading journals. Furthermore, the time evolution of the major graphene based research topics and the top 10 most productive research organizations with respect to their specific topics have been analyzed and are shown as heat maps. In addition, the graphene research landscape has been established using the analysis tool STN AnaVist. Finally, a brief citation analysis has been performed. The time evolution of the impact reveals that, rather similar to the output evolution, the impact increase of the graphene papers within the starting period is possibly going to outrun the impact increase of the fullerenes and nanotubes papers.},

abstract = {Information on the size of academic search engines and bibliographic databases (ASEBDs) is often outdated or entirely unavailable. Hence, it is difficult to assess the scope of specific databases, such as Google Scholar. While scientometric studies have estimated ASEBD sizes before, the methods employed were able to compare only a few databases. Consequently, there is no up-to-date comparative information on the sizes of popular ASEBDs. This study aims to fill this blind spot by providing a comparative picture of 12 of the most commonly used ASEBDs. In doing so, we build on and refine previous scientometric research by counting query hit data as an indicator of the number of accessible records. Iterative query optimization makes it possible to identify a maximum number of hits for most ASEBDs. The results were validated in terms of their capacity to assess database size by comparing them with official information on database sizes or previous scientometric studies. The queries used here are replicable, so size information can be updated quickly. The findings provide first-time size estimates of ProQuest and EbscoHost and indicate that Google Scholar's size might have been underestimated so far by more than 50%. By our estimation Google Scholar, with 389 million records, is currently the most comprehensive academic search engine.},

abstract = {Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice. {\textcopyright} 2013 Thelwall et al.},

abstract = {Altmetrics, indices based on social media platforms and tools, have recently emerged as alternative means of measuring scholarly impact. Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products in the social web. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians examining both their own use of online platforms and the use of their papers on social reference managers. As expected, coverage varied: 82 % of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28 % were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation counts. We conducted a survey among the participants of the STI2012 participants. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68 % of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72 % valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.},

While peer review and bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics. Furthermore, their benefits and disadvantages for measuring impact are discussed. },

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag "good for teaching" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented ("new finding"). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact.If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.},

In addition to providing a mathematical tool for smoothing raw data in which the underlying function is known to be periodic, this algorithm has special significance in computer graphics, because the use of smoothing functions with periodic end conditions is essential for producing visually acceptable, smooth, closed curves. Sample plots are included to illustrate the power and flexibility of this algorithm. {\textcopyright} 1983 The Bell System Technical Journal},

abstract = {Two algorithms are presented for smoothing arbitrary sets of data. They are the explicit variable algorithm and the parametric variable algorithm. The former would be used where large gradients are not encountered because of the smaller amount of calculation required. The latter would be used if the data being smoothed were double valued or experienced large gradients. Both algorithms use a least-squares technique to obtain a cubic spline fit to the data. The advantage of the spline fit is that the first and second derivatives are continuous. This method is best used in an interactive graphics environment so that the junction values for the spline curve can be manipulated to improve the fit.},

abstract = {We present a system of interpolating splines with first-order and approximate second-order geometric continuity. The curves are easily computed in linear time by solving a diagonally dominant, tridiagonal system of linear equations. Emphasis is placed on the need to find aesthetically pleasing curves in a wide range of circumstances; favorable results are obtained even when the knots are very unequally spaced or widely separated. The curves are invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling, and the effects of a local change fall off exponentially as one moves away from the disturbed knot. Approximate second-order continuity is achieved by using a linear "mock curvature" function in place of the actual endpoint curvature for each spline segment and choosing tangent directions at knots so as to equalize these. This avoids extraneous solutions and other forms of undesirable behavior without seriously compromising the quality of the results. The actual spline segments can come from any family of curves whose endpoint curvatures can be suitably approximated, but we propose a specific family of parametric cubics. There is freedom to allow tangent directions and "tension" parameters to be specified at knots, and special "curl" parameters may be given for additional control near the endpoints of open curves. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

An interpolant constructed in this way does not require solving a system of linear equations as many approaches do. However there are vanishing tangent vectors at the interpolating points. By blending with a Bezier curve using the data points as the control points, the blended curve is a proper smooth interpolant. The blending factor has the effect similar to the "tension" control of tension splines. Piecewise interpolants can be constructed in an analogous way as a connection of Bezier curve segments to achieve C1 continuity at the connecting points. Smooth interpolating surface patches can also be defined by blending sinusoidal polynomial tensor surfaces and Bezier tensor surfaces. The interpolant can very efficiently be evaluated by tabulating the sinusoidal function.},

abstract = {A basic technique for designing curved shapes in the plane is interpolating splines. The designer inputs a sequence of control points, and the computer ﬁts a smooth curve that goes through these points. The literature of interpolating splines is rich, much of it based on the mathematical idealization of a thin elastic strip constrained to pass through the points. Until now there is little consensus on which, if any, of these splines is ideal. This thesis explores the properties of an ideal interpolating spline. The most important property is fairness, a property often in tension with locality, meaning that perturbations to the input points do not aﬀect sections of the curve at a distance. The idealized elastic strip has two serious problems. A sequence of co-circular input points results in a curve deviating from a circular arc. For some other inputs, no solution (with ﬁnite extent) exists at all. The idealized elastic strip has two properties worth preserving. First, any ideal spline must be extensional, meaning that the insertion of a new point on the curve shouldn't change its shape. Second, curve segments between any two adjacent control points are drawn from a two-parameter family (and this propety is closely related to good locality properties). A central result of this thesis is that any spline sharing these properties also has the property that all segments between two control points are cut from a single, ﬁxed generating curve. Thus, the problem of choosing an ideal spline is reduced to that of choosing the ideal generating curve. The Euler spiral has excellent all-around properties, and, for some applications, a log-aesthetic curve may be even better. Shapes in applications such as font outlines contain extra features such as corners and transitions between straight lines and smooth curves. Attaching additional constraints to control points expresses these features, and, carefully applied, give the designer a richer palette of curve types. The splines presented in this thesis are entirely practical as well, especially for designing fonts. Sophisticated new numerical techniques compute the splines at interactive speeds, as well as convert to optimized cubic B´ezier representation.},

abstract = {The development of digital fabrication has reintroduced material processes with digital processes. There has been much discussion about the tool and the objects of the tool, but little discussion of the implication of the material process on the digital process. A brief historical review on the development of computer numerical control and the origins of the B{\'{e}}zier curve reveals an instrumental fact: computer numerical controlled tools necessitated advancements in computational surfaces which eventually led to NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces. In other words, the origins of NURBS surfaces resides in its relation to material processes, rather than many current approaches that develop free form surfaces and then force the tool onto the material without regard to the material properties. From this historical and mathematical review, this project develops toward more intelligent construction methods based on the integration of NURBS differential geometry paired with material qualities and processes. Specifically, a digital technique of developing conceptual NURBS geometry into piecewise surface patches are then flattened based on the material thickness and density. From these flattened patches, a material technique is developed to intelligently remove material to allow the rigid flat material to re-develop into physical surface patches. The goal of this research is to develop digital and material techniques toward intelligent construction based on the correspondence between digitally driven surface and digitally driven material processes. The application of this technique as a rational and flexible system is to support the dynamic response of form and material toward such performative aspects as structure, daylight, ventilation, and thermal properties.},

abstract = {Cubic spline interpolation on Euclidean space is a standard topic in numerical analysis, with countless applications in science and technology. In several emerging fields, for example, computer vision and quantum control, there is a growing need for spline interpolation on curved, non-Euclidean space. The generalization of cubic splines to manifolds is not self-evident, with several distinct approaches. One possibility is to mimic the acceleration minimizing property, which leads to Riemannian cubics. This, however, requires the solution of a coupled set of nonlinear boundary value problems that cannot be integrated explicitly, even if formulae for geodesics are available. Another possibility is to mimic De Casteljau's algorithm, which leads to generalized B{\'{e}}zier curves. To construct C2-splines from such curves is a complicated nonlinear problem, until now lacking numerical methods. Here we provide an iterative algorithm for C2-splines on Riemannian symmetric spaces, and we prove convergence of linear order. In terms of numerical tractability and computational efficiency, the new method surpasses those based on Riemannian cubics. Each iteration is parallel and thus suitable for multicore implementation. We demonstrate the algorithm for three geometries of interest: the n-sphere, complex projective space, and the real Grassmannian.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique to incorporate psychoacoustic models into an adaptive wavelet packet scheme to achieve perceptually transparent compression of high-quality (44.1 kHz) audio signals at about 45 kb/s. The filter bank structure adapts according to psychoacoustic criteria and according to the computational complexity that is available at the decoder. This permits software implementations that can perform according to the computational power available in order to achieve real time coding/decoding. The bit allocation scheme is an adapted zero-tree algorithm that also takes input from the psychoacoustic model. The measure of performance is a quantity called subband perceptual rate, which the filter bank structure adapts to approach the perceptual entropy (PE) as closely as possible. In addition, this method is also amenable to progressive transmission, that is, it can achieve the best quality of reconstruction possible considering the size of the bit stream available at the encoder. The result is a variablerate compression scheme for high-quality audio that takes into account the allowed computational complexity, the available bitbudget, and the psychoacoustic criteria for transparent coding. This paper thus provides a novel scheme to marry the results in wavelet packets and perceptual coding to construct an algorithm that is well suited to high-quality audio transfer for internet and storage applications. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

The ACER procedure applies a pseudo exhaustive search process and spectral difference grading. Since ACER exploits musical structure, the amount of data reduction achieved varies from piece-to-piece. The system is described before results on a corpus of material are presented. The analysis shows moderate amounts of data reduction take place whilst the system is operating within parameters designed to maintain high-levels of perceptual audio quality, whilst lower rates of perceptual quality yield greater data reduction. Objective quality evaluations are conducted that reveal degradation in fidelity that is relative to the compression parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are successfully used in a number of applications. However, their storage and computational requirements have largely prevented their widespread use on mobile devices. Here we present an effective CNN compression approach in the frequency domain, which focuses not only on smaller weights but on all the weights and their underlying connections. By treating convolutional filters as images, we decompose their representations in the frequency domain as common parts (i.e., cluster centers) shared by other similar filters and their individual private parts (i.e., individual residuals). A large number of low-energy frequency coefficients in both parts can be discarded to produce high compression without significantly compromising accuracy. We relax the computational burden of convolution operations in CNNs by linearly combining the convolution responses of discrete cosine transform (DCT) bases. The compression and speed-up ratios of the proposed algorithm are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated on benchmark image datasets to demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {A large fraction of Internet traffic is now driven by requests from mobile devices with relatively small screens and often stringent bandwidth requirements. Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will significantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional LSTM recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efficient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32×32 thumbnails, our LSTM-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) JPEG, JPEG2000 and WebP, with a storage size that is reduced by 10% or more.},

Each method has the ability to perform a different compression. This paper explains how a method works in doing a compression and explains which method is well used in doing a data compression in the form of text.

abstract = {We describe an image compression method, consisting of a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.},

First, we modify the recurrent architecture to improve spatial diffusion, which allows the network to more effectively capture and propagate image information through the network's hidden state. Second, in addition to lossless entropy coding, we use a spatially adaptive bit allocation algorithm to more efficiently use the limited number of bits to encode visually complex image regions. Finally, we show that training with a pixel-wise loss weighted by SSIM increases reconstruction quality according to multiple metrics. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and Tecnick image sets and compare against standard codecs as well as recently published methods based on deep neural networks.},

New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.},

An organism needs to track fitness-relevant information about its world, but the more information it tracks, the more resources it must devote to perception. As a first step towards a general understanding of this trade-off, we use a tool from information theory, rate-distortion theory, to study large, unstructured environments with fixed, randomly drawn penalties for stimuli confusion ('distortions'). We identify two distinct regimes for organisms in these environments: a high-fidelity regime where perceptual costs grow linearly with environmental complexity, and a low-fidelity regime where perceptual costs are, remarkably, independent of the number of environmental states. This suggests that in environments of rapidly increasing complexity, well-adapted organisms will find themselves able to make, just barely, the most subtle distinctions in their environment.},

abstract = {Audio data compression has revolutionised the way in which the music industry and musicians sell and distribute their products. Our previous research presented a novel codec named ACER (Audio Compression Exploiting Repetition), which achieves data reduction by exploiting irrelevancy and redundancy in musical structure whilst generally maintaining acceptable levels of noise and distortion in objective evaluations. However, previous work did not evaluate ACER using subjective listening tests, leaving a gap to demonstrate its applicability under human audio perception tests. In this paper, we present a double-blind listening test that was conducted with a range of listeners (N=100). The aim was to determine the efficacy of the ACER codec, in terms of perceptible noise and spatial distortion artefacts, against de facto standards for audio data compression and an uncompressed reference. Results show that participants reported no perceived differences between the uncompressed, MP3, AAC, ACER high quality, and ACER medium quality compressed audio in terms of noise and distortions but that the ACER low quality format was perceived as being of lower quality. However, in terms of participants' perceptions of the stereo field, all formats under test performed as well as each other, with no statistically significant differences. A qualitative, thematic analysis of listeners' feedback revealed that the noise artefacts that produced the ACER technique are different from those of comparator codecs, reflecting its novel approach. Results show that the quality of contemporary audio compression systems has reached a stage where their performance is perceived to be as good as uncompressed audio. The ACER format is able to compete as an alternative, with results showing a preference for the ACER medium quality versions over WAV, MP3, and AAC. The ACER process itself is viable on its own or in conjunction with techniques such as MP3 and AAC.},

abstract = {Although digital music streaming and downloading practices highlight a preference for portability over fidelity among pop music consumers, for some ‘high fidelity' continues to be a crucial component of their pop music engagement. This article examines the political dimensions of audio preferences. It considers comments by Neil Young and those within The Distortion of Sound who claim that the lossy compression encoding process – used in digital downloading and streaming – significantly degrades the quality of recorded sound and compromises valuable pop music characteristics. In 2015, these claims were followed by the development of the ‘hi-res' music player device and digital download store ‘Pono'. This article argues that some criticism of lossy compression can be understood as ‘audio capital'. Rather than merely exchanging aesthetic preferences, or a reliable metric of the audibility of high fidelity, audio capital describes the reconversion of celebrity status and economic capital into a class divide structured by an appreciation for large-scale music production.},

abstract = {The 2D digital waveguide mesh has proven to be effective and efficient in the modeling of musical membranes and plates, particularly in combination with recent simplifications in modeling stiffness, nonlinearities, and felt mallet excitations. The rectilinear 3D extension to the mesh had been suggested, and has been applied to the case of room acoustics. However, it requires the use of 6-port scattering junctions, which make a multiply-free implementation impossible in the isotropic case. The 4-port scattering junctions of the 2D mesh required only an internal divide by 2, which could be implemented as a right shift in binary arithmetic. However, the 6-port junction requires a divide by 3. The multiply-free cases occur for N-port junctions in which N is a power of two. We propose here a tetrahedral distribution of multiply-free 4-port scattering junctions filling space much like the molecular structure of the diamond crystal, where the placement of the scattering junctions corresponds to the placement of the carbon nuclei, and the bi-directional delay units correspond to the four tetrahedrally spaced single bonds between each pair of nuclei. We show that the tetrahedral mesh is mathematically equivalent to a finite difference scheme (FDS) which approximates the 3D lossless wave equation. We further compute the frequency- and direction-dependent plane wave propagation speed dispersion error},

abstract = {In this thesis the physical modelling of percussive drums was approached using\ndigital waveguides. The constituent components of a drum were considered individually before connecting them together to complete the model.\nTo model the drumskin techniques were created to incorporate smooth curved\nboundaries, calculate the impedance of a 2D waveguide mesh and include the\neffect of the bearing edge. The accuracy of the curved boundary model, which\nutilised ‘rimguides', was demonstrated with a good reproduction of the first\nseven resonant modes of a circular membrane. The impedance was used in a\nkettledrum model where it correctly controlled the exchange of energy between\nthe drumskin and interior air. Simulations of different bearing edge sizes revealed that a blunt edge takes energy from low frequencies and redistributes\nit into higher frequencies. These decay faster and so the result is a decrease in\nsustain.\nFor the interior air it was necessary to correctly model 3D wave propagation\nand incorporate diffuse reflections, which occur at rough surfaces. Unlike 3D\nmeshes used in previous studies, the new dodecahedral mesh proposed here\nwas found to exhibit near direction independent dispersion error. The effect\nof diffusion was adequately simulated with a technique that was shown to be\ncontrollable, enabling different types of surface to be modelled.\nTo complete the drum model a way of connecting different waveguide meshes\ntogether was found and a new procedure for modelling a mallet exciter was\nproposed. The interfacing method enabled a lossless interconnection between\ntwo 2D meshes and also 2D and 3D meshes. The procedure used for the mallet exciter incorporated non-linear stiffness and the mallet's contact area. Its\nbehaviour was shown to be almost identical to that of a real mallet.\nFinally, a digital waveguide model of a kettledrum was constructed to demonstrate the techniques and the results were promising; the resonant modes were\nreproduced with good accuracy and their decay was sufficient to give the impression of realism, whilst not exactly matching that found through measurement.},

In this thesis we provide an investigation in to the practical use and extension of the technique in musical instrument models, with an emphasis towards models of drums. The standard waveguide technique is described and analysed mathematically for basic models in one, two and three dimensions. Results of simulations are provided and compared against expected theoretical output. Methods to improve the quality of the simulations by considering the boundary termination and correcting the numerical dispersion error are discussed. A model for a drum is presented which utilises a technique to interface 2D and 3D mesh structures. An analysis of the model is provided which compares the output to phenomena found from measurements of real instruments. Extensions to the simple waveguide are proposed which include the modelling of stiff media in both 1D and 2D. These models include bars, stiff strings, plates and stiff membranes and in each case model output is analysed in depth by comparing to expected theoretical output. We also discuss approaches to include material specific frequency dependent damping. The main contributions of this thesis have been in the analysis of the waveguide technique in 3D, the method of correcting dispersion error, the analysis and extension of the 1D and 2D stiff models and the development and extension of the interfacing technique used in the drum model. The original focus of the work was for drum modelling, but the analogies and implications to other musical instruments, and indeed in the area of room acoustics, are quite clear.},

abstract = {Acoustical physical modelling synthesis uses mathematical algorithms to describe a real-world sound production process or propagational environ-ment. Digital waveguides can be used to form a 1D model of the vocal tract, simplistically represented as a series of cylindrical tubes of varying radius along a straight axis. This 1D signal propagating element can also be extended to create a digital waveguide mesh (DWM), giving acoustical synthesis of a higher dimensional structure, such as a 2D surface or 3D space. The work contained in this thesis is an investigation into the effects of increased dimensionality in the 1D waveguide vocal tract paradigm. A 2D DWM is configured as a model of the tract, such that shape characteristics are set within the width of the mesh. Wave propagation and reflection is simulated along the tract from the glottis to the lips, as well as across it, between the two inner walls, thereby removing plane-wave limitations inherent in the 1D model. The 2D tract is found to give accurate formant synthesis, producing vowels that give a good match to real-world targets. However, problems associated with high sampling frequency limitations and discontinuous dynamic operation are identified. Movements readily occurring in speech, such as diphthongs, are not easily accommodated by the static mesh structure. A novel alternative approach is also presented which maintains a rect-angular mesh, but maps the changing tract shapes onto the waveguide impedances. This allows for stable dynamic manipulation of the modelled space. Furthermore, sampling frequency limitations are removed, such that real-time operation and interaction with the 2D tract model is achieved. i Contents Abstract i Acknowledgments xi Declaration xii},

This acoustic model describes the propagation of longitudinal waves in axisymmetric acoustic pipes with a varying cross-section, visco-thermal losses at the walls, and without assuming planar or spherical waves. Moreover, three types of discontinuities of the shape can be taken into account (radius, slope, and curvature). The purpose of this work is to build low-cost digital simulations in the time domain based on the WebsterLokshin model. First, decomposing a resonator into independent elementary parts and isolating delay operators lead to a KellyLochbaum network of input/output systems and delays. Second, for a systematic assembling of elements, their statespace representations are derived in discrete time. Then, standard tools of automatic control are used to reduce the complexity of digital simulations in the time domain. The method is applied to a real trombone, and results of simulations are presented and compared with measurements. This method seems to be a promising approach in term of modularity, complexity of calculation, and accuracy, for any acoustic resonators based on tubes. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The one-dimensional digital waveguides, combined with the commuted synthesis method, allow modeling and high-quality synthesis of plucked string instrument tones in a very efficient manner. However, the increasing computational power of the modern processors makes it feasible to experiment with more complex algorithms also for real-time sound synthesis purposes. By certain simplifications, time-domain methods based on finite differences (FDTD) are efficient enough to run in real time on modern processors and yet they are more flexible than the computationally less expensive commuted synthesis. The resulting structures, which are called 1-D FDTD waveguides, have previously been shown to be equal to or to approximate many properties of digital waveguides, including lossless and lossy propagation, input and output ports, terminations, and scattering junctions. The numerical stability of the 1-D FDTD waveguides, as well as their initialization and formation of the traveling waves are well understood. However, a careful comparison between 1-D FDTD waveguides and conventional digital waveguides in terms of their limitations, computational efficiency, accuracy, and interaction has not been carried out. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by highlighting important properties of both methods side by side in string instrument modeling and synthesis. We then try to combine the best properties of both methods and discuss the interaction of the two model structures. Synthetic tones and short musical phrases obtained by both synthesis models will be demonstrated during the presentation. These sound examples will also be available at http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/demos/.},

The basic idea is to imitate the sound production mechanism of an acoustic musical instrument using a computer program. The sound produced by such a model will automatically resemble that of the real instrument, if the model has been devised in a proper way. In this article we review the history and present techniques of physical modelling. It appears that the many seemingly very different modelling methods try to achieve the same result: to simulate the solutions of the wave equation in a simplified manner. We concentrate on the digital waveguide modelling technique which has gained much popularity among both researchers and engineers in the music technology industry. The benefits and drawbacks of the new technology are considered, and concurrent research topics are discussed. The physical modelling approach offers many new applications, especially in the fields of multimedia and virtual reality. {\textcopyright} 1996, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the effects of latency (0-20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms ± 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

In particular, it examines two case studies-virtual orchestral instruments and virtual singing instruments-to consider how their design and implementation seek to express human music performance by adopting the micro and macro sonic variations of timing, pitch, dynamics, articulation, ambience, and other limitations imposed by the physical relationship between the player and the instrument. Baudrillard considers that "simulation threatens the difference between the 'true' and the 'false', the 'real' and the 'imaginary'" (1994: 3). By feigning the acoustic markers of expressive human musical performance, virtual instrument designers and composer-users encourage the listener to produce, in themselves, the experience of hearing an orchestra or singer. Users also contribute to the recontextualization of human performance by feeding back into the cultures and development cycles of virtual instrument software, where sonic gestures are recurrently refreshed. The construction of virtual instruments as devices of musical expressivity is, therefore, an evolving, mutually constructed, and performative endeavour.},

In the first case, eight people with normal vision and no motor disability participated in a music-playing session in which both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. In the second case 31 people qualitatively evaluated the EyeHarp in a concert setting consisting of two parts: a solo performance part, and an ensemble (EyeHarp, two guitars, and flute) performance part. The obtained results indicate that, similarly to traditional music instruments, the proposed digital musical instrument has a steep learning curve, and allows to produce expressive performances both from the performer and audience perspective.},

abstract = {Over the past four decades, the number, diversity and complexity of digital musical instruments (DMIs) has increased rapidly. There are very few constraints on DMI design as such systems can be easily reconfigured, offering near limitless flexibility for music-making. Given that new acoustic musical instruments have in many cases been created in response to the limitations of available technologies, what motivates the development of new DMIs? We conducted an interview study with ten designers of new DMIs, in order to explore (a) the motivations electronic musicians may have for wanting to build their own instruments; and (b) the extent to which these motivations relate to the context in which the artist works and performs (academic vs club settings). We found that four categories of motivation were mentioned most often: M1 – wanting to bring greater embodiment to the activity of performing and producing electronic music; M2 – wanting to improve audience experiences of DMI performances; M3 – wanting to develop new sounds, and M4 – wanting to build responsive systems for improvisation. There were also some detectable trends in motivation according to the context in which the artists work and perform. Our results offer the first systematically gathered insights into the motivations for new DMI design. It appears that the challenges of controlling digital sound synthesis drive the development of new DMIs, rather than the shortcomings of any one particular design or existing technology.},

Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.},

For each of these scenarios, we quantitatively and qualitatively test whether the learned variable (price strategy) converges to the Nash equilibrium. We also study the impact of the temperature parameter (defining the exploitation/exploration trade off) on these results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Nowe2012,
abstract = {Reinforcement Learning was originally developed for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It allows a single agent to learn a policy that maximizes a possibly delayed reward signal in a stochastic stationary environment. It guarantees convergence to the optimal policy, provided that the agent can sufficiently experiment and the environment in which it is operating is Markovian. However, when multiple agents apply reinforcement learning in a shared environment, this might be beyond the MDP model. In such systems, the optimal policy of an agent depends not only on the environment, but on the policies of the other agents as well. These situations arise naturally in a variety of domains, such as: robotics, telecommunications, economics, distributed control, auctions, traffic light control, etc. In these domains multi-agent learning is used, either because of the complexity of the domain or because control is inherently decentralized. In such systems it is important that agents are capable of discovering good solutions to the problem at hand either by coordinating with other learners or by competing with them. This chapter focuses on the application reinforcement learning techniques in multi-agent systems. We describe a basic learning framework based on the economic research into game theory, and illustrate the additional complexity that arises in such systems. We also described a representative selection of algorithms for the different areas of multi-agent reinforcement learning research.},

The neuronal substrate and the computational algorithms underlying such adaptive decision making, however, is largely unknown. We propose a population coding model of spiking neurons with a policy gradient procedure that successfully acquires optimal strategies for classical game-theoretical tasks. The suggested population reinforcement learning reproduces data from human behavioral experiments for the blackjack and the inspector game. It performs optimally according to a pure (deterministic) and mixed (stochastic) Nash equilibrium, respectively. In contrast, temporal-difference(TD)-learning, covariance-learning, and basic reinforcement learning fail to perform optimally for the stochastic strategy.

As the number of players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase their final rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to find a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov Games. In this paper, we introduce a new definition of ϵ-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy's quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellman-like residuals implies to learn such an ϵ-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the Lp norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally, we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium in generic multiplayer general-sum turn-based MGs.},

As GANs are difficult to train much research has focused on this. However, very little of this research has directly exploited gametheoretic techniques. We introduce Generative Adversarial Network Games (GANGs), which explicitly model a finite zero-sum game between a generator (G) and classifier (C) that use mixed strategies. The size of these games precludes exact solution methods, therefore we define resource-bounded best responses (RBBRs), and a resourcebounded Nash Equilibrium (RB-NE) as a pair of mixed strategies such that neitherG orC can find a better RBBR. The RB-NE solution concept is richer than the notion of 'local Nash equilibria' in that it captures not only failures of escaping local optima of gradient descent, but applies to any approximate best response computations, including methods with random restarts. To validate our approach, we solve GANGs with the Parallel Nash Memory algorithm, which provably monotonically converges to an RB-NE. We compare our results to standard GAN setups, and demonstrate that our method deals well with typical GAN problems such as mode collapse, partial mode coverage and forgetting.},

abstract = {Security is a critical concern around the world, whether it is the challenge of protecting ports, airports and other critical infrastructure, interdicting the illegal flow of drugs, weapons and money, protecting endangered species, forests and fisheries, suppressing urban crime or security in cyberspace. Unfortunately, limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times; instead, we must optimize the use of limited security resources. To that end, we founded the “security games” framework to build decision-aids for security agencies. Security games is a novel area of research that is based on computational and behavioral game theory, while also incorporating elements of AI planning under uncertainty and machine learning. We have deployed securitygames based decision aids for infrastructure security such as at the ports and ferry traffic with the US coast guard (in the ports of New York, Boston, Los Angeles/Long Beach, Houston and others), for security of airports and air traffic with the US Federal Air Marshals and the Los Angeles World Airport (LAX) police, and tested this framework for security of metro trains with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. Moreover, recent work on “green security games” has led to testing our decision aids for protection of fisheries with the US Coast Guard and protection of wildlife at sites in multiple countries, and opportunistic crime security games have focused on suppressing urban crime. This chapter will discuss applications of security games, and outline research challenges in security games including algorithms for scaling up security games as well as for handling significant adversarial uncertainty and learning models of human adversary behaviors. امنیت یک نگرانی مهم در سراسر جهان است، که آیا آن را به چالش حفاظت از بنادر، فرودگاه ها و دیگر زیرساخت های حیاتی، ممنوعیت جریان غیر قانونی مواد مخدر، سلاح و پول، حفاظت از گونه های در معرض خطر، جنگل و شیلات، سرکوب جرم یا امنیت شهری در فضای مجازی است . متاسفانه، منابع امنیتی محدود جلوگیری از پوشش امنیتی کامل در هر زمان. در عوض، ما باید با استفاده از منابع امنیتی محدود بهینه سازی. برای این منظور، ما "بازی های امنیتی" چارچوب برای ساخت تصمیم کمک برای سازمان های امنیتی تاسیس شد. بازی های امنیت یک منطقه جدیدی از تحقیقاتی است که در تئوری بازی ها محاسباتی و رفتاری بر اساس، در حالی که همچنین ترکیب عناصر برنامه ریزی AI تحت عدم قطعیت و یادگیری ماشین است. ما کمک تصمیم گیری بر اساس securitygames برای امنیت زیرساخت هایی مانند در بنادر و کشتی های ترافیک با گارد ساحلی ایالات متحده (در بنادر نیویورک، بوستون، لس آنجلس / لانگ بیچ، هوستون و دیگران) مستقر کرده اند، برای امنیت فرودگاه ها و هوا ترافیک با مارشال ایالات متحده فدرال هوایی و پلیس فرودگاه جهان لس آنجلس (LAX)، و این چارچوب برای امنیت قطارهای مترو با وزارت لس آنجلس کلانتر تست شده است. علاوه بر این، آثار اخیر در "بازی های امنیت سبز" است به آزمایش ایدز تصمیم ما برای حفاظت از ماهیگیری با گارد ساحلی ایالات متحده و حفاظت از حیات وحش در سایت ها در کشورهای متعدد، و بازی های امنیتی جرم و جنایت فرصت طلب به رهبری در سرکوب جرم و جنایت شهری متمرکز شده است. این فصل برنامه های کاربردی از بازی های امنیتی مورد بحث، و رئوس مطالب چالش های پژوهش در بازی های امنیتی از جمله الگوریتم برای پوسته پوسته شدن تا بازی امنیتی و همچنین برای دست زدن به عدم قطعیت خصمانه قابل توجه و مدل های رفتارهای دشمن انسان یادگیری},

abstract = {We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of general-sum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (defined by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the first grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of offline learning performance in both games, we find agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.},

abstract = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Degree, betweenness, and closeness centralities are defined only for classically simple graphs-those with strictly binary relations between vertices. Looking only at these classical graphs, where eigenvectors and graph-theoretic measures are competitors, eigenvector centrality is designed to be distinctively different from mere degree centrality when there are some high degree positions connected to many low degree others or some low degree positions are connected to a few high degree others. Therefore, it will not be distinctively different from degree when positions are all equal in degree (regular graphs) or in core-periphery structures in which high degree positions tend to be connected to each other. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Using this approach, we develop the fastest known algorithm for computing approximately maximum s-t flows. For a graph having n vertices and m edges, our algorithm computes a (1-∈)-approximately maximum s-t flow in time ∼O(mn1/3∈-11/3). A dual version of our approach gives the fastest known algorithm for computing a (1+∈)-approximately minimum s-t cut. It takes ∼O(m+n 4/3∈-16/3) time. Previously, the best dependence on m and n was achieved by the algorithm of Goldberg and Rao (J.

In this regime the measure is no longer useful for distinguishing among the remaining nodes and its efficacy as a network metric is impaired. As a remedy, we propose an alternative centrality measure based on the nonbacktracking matrix, which gives results closely similar to the standard eigenvector centrality in dense networks where the latter is well behaved but avoids localization and gives useful results in regimes where the standard centrality fails.},

Unlike standard methods for computing a full eigenbasis of sparse symmetric matrices, the algorithm presented here is non-iterative, and produces exact results under an infinite-precision computation model. In addition, our method is highly parallelizable; given access to unlimited parallel processors, the eigenbasis can be constructed in only O(n) time given n and k.

abstract = {How duplicate genes provide genetic robustness remains an unresolved question. We have examined the duplicated histone deacetylases Sir2p and Hst1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find that these paralogs with non-overlapping functions can provide genetic robustness against null mutations through a substitution mechanism. Hst1p is an NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase that acts with Sum1p to repress a subset of midsporulation genes. However, hst1Delta mutants show much weaker derepression of target loci than sum1Delta mutants. We show that this modest derepression of target loci in hst1Delta strains occurs in part because Sir2p substitutes for Hst1p. Sir2p contributes to repression of the midsporulation genes only in the absence of Hst1p and is recruited to target promoters by a physical interaction with the Sum1 complex. Furthermore, when Sir2p associates with the Sum1 complex, the complex continues to repress in a promoter-specific manner and does not spread. Our results imply that after the duplication, SIR2 and HST1 subfunctionalized. The single SIR2/HST1 gene from Kluyveromyces lactis, a closely related species that diverged prior to the duplication, can suppress an hst1Delta mutation in S. cerevisiae as well as interact with Sir4p in S. cerevisiae. In addition, the existence of two distinct protein interaction domains for the Sir and Sum1 complexes was revealed through the analysis of a chimeric Sir2-Hst1 molecule. Therefore, the ability of Sir2p to substitute for Hst1p probably results from a retained but reduced affinity for the Sum1 complex that is a consequence of subfunctionalization via the duplication, degeneration, and complementation mechanism. These results suggest that the evolutionary path of duplicate gene preservation may be an important indicator for the ability of duplicated genes to contribute to genetic robustness.},

We also compare the performance of inherently real-valued transform algorithms such as the fast Hartley transform (FHT) and the fast cosine transform (FCT) to real-valued FFT algorithms for the computation of power spectra and cyclic convolutions.

abstract = {Fourier transform methods are used to analyze functions and data sets to provide frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of underlying oscillatory components. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods offer speed advantages over evaluation of explicit integrals (EI) that define Fourier transforms. This paper compares frequency, amplitude, and phase accuracy of the two methods for well resolved peaks over a wide array of data sets including cosine series with and without random noise and a variety of physical data sets, including atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentrations, tides, temperatures, sound waveforms, and atomic spectra. The FFT uses MIT's FFTW3 library. The EI method uses the rectangle method to compute the areas under the curve via complex math. Results support the hypothesis that EI methods are more accurate than FFT methods. Errors range from 5 to 10 times higher when determining peak frequency by FFT, 1.4 to 60 times higher for peak amplitude, and 6 to 10 times higher for phase under a peak. The ability to compute more accurate Fourier transforms has promise for improved data analysis in many fields, including more sensitive assessment of hypotheses in the environmental sciences related to $\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentrations and temperature. Other methods are available to address different weaknesses in FFTs; however, the EI method always produces the most accurate output possible for a given data set. On the 2011 Lenovo ThinkPad used in this study, an EI transform on a 10,000 point data set took 31 seconds to complete. Source code (C) and Windows executable for the EI method are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/.},

abstract = {Frequency estimation from discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients of a rectangular windowed signal under the influence of additive white noise is a well studied problem in signal processing. In its simplest form, the process involves finding the spectral peaks. When higher frequency resolution is required, a frequency offset can be found from the interpolation of DFT coefficients. However, most of the past researches focus on monotonic cisoid signals. In practical situations where multiple harmonics are present, the sidelobes from other harmonics interfere with the estimation of the harmonic being considered. In this case, windows with smaller sidelobes such as Hanning window are preferred over rectangular window. Given the increased mathematical complexity of Hanning window, analytical solution has not yet been available for DFT interpolation. In this paper, we derive an exact analytical solution of the estimated frequency from DFT interpolation of Hanning windowed signal. In experiments, we show that the new analytical solution is accurate for monotonic cisoid signal and can considerably reduce the effect of interharmonic interference as compared to previous rectangular windowed methods.},

abstract = {A method based on the Fourier convolution theorem is developed for the analysis of data composed of random noise, plus an unknown constant "base line," plus a sum of (or an integral over a continuous spectrum of) exponential decay functions. The Fourier method's usual serious practical limitation of needing high accuracy data over a very wide range is eliminated by the introduction of convergence parameters and a Gaussian taper window. A computer program is described for the analysis of discrete spectra, where the data involves only a sum of exponentials. The program is completely automatic in that the only necessary inputs are the raw data (not necessarily in equal intervals of time); no potentially biased initial guesses concerning either the number or the values of the components are needed. The outputs include the number of components, the amplitudes and time constants together with their estimated errors, and a spectral plot of the solution. The limiting resolving power of the method is studied by analyzing a wide range of simulated two-, three-, and four-component data. The results seem to indicate that the method is applicable over a considerably wider range of conditions than nonlinear least squares or the method of moments. {\textcopyright} 1976, The Biophysical Society.

However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The rain-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.},

As weight functions, we show that Fourier kernels have excellent properties. Terms related to integral boundaries are readily eliminated, observations are provided by Fourier coefficients, and the relation becomes independently accurate for multiple sinusoids if they are sufficiently spaced. We solve the obtained equations in two ways: one is for approaching to the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB), and the other is for enhancing the interference rejection capability. Also, methods are proposed to calculate the weighted integrals from sampled signals with an improved accuracy. Proposed algorithms are examined under noise and sinusoidal interference.

abstract = {Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets presents a thorough introduction to the mathematical foundations of signal and image processing. Key concepts and applications are addressed in a thought-provoking manner and are implemented using vector, matrix, and linear algebra methods. With a balanced focus on mathematical theory and computational techniques, this self-contained book equips readers with the essential knowledge needed to transition smoothly from mathematical models to practical digital data applications. The book first establishes a complete vector space and matrix framework for analyzing signals and images. Classical methods such as the discrete Fourier transform, the discrete cosine transform, and their application to JPEG compression are outlined followed by coverage of the Fourier series and the general theory of inner product spaces and orthogonal bases. The book then addresses convolution, filtering, and windowing techniques for signals and images. Finally, modern approaches are introduced, including wavelets and the theory of filter banks as a means of understanding the multiscale localized analysis underlying the JPEG 2000 compression standard. Throughout the book, examples using image compression demonstrate how mathematical theory translates into application. Additional applications such as progressive transmission of images, image denoising, spectrographic analysis, and edge detection are discussed. Each chapter provides a series of exercises as well as a MATLAB project that allows readers to apply mathematical concepts to solving real problems. Additional MATLAB routines are available via the book's related Web site. With its insightful treatment of the underlying mathematics in image compression and signal processing, Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets is an ideal book for mathematics, engineering, and computer science courses at the upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for mathematicians, engineers, and other practitioners who would like to learn more about the relevance of mathematics in digital data processing.},

It is also shown that the covariance matrix of the DFT components is approximately a diagonal matrix, imposing very weak assumptions on the noise in the time domain. Formulas are given for estimating the maximal values of the nondiagonal elements. The mean of the distribution is zero except for the dc component where there is a known bias.},

abstract = {Spectral modeling synthesis is an analysis-based technique capable of capturing the perceptual characteristics of a wide variety of sounds. The representation that results from the analysis is intuitive and is easily mapped to useful musical parameters. The analysis part is central to the system. It is a complex algorithm that requires the manual setting of a few control parameters. Further work may automate the analysis process, particularly if there is a specialization for a group of sounds. Some aspects of the analysis are also open to further research, in particular the peak-continuation algorithm. The synthesis from the deterministic plus stochastic representation is simple and can be performed in real time with current technology. A real-time implementation of this system would allow the use of this technnique in performance.},

Polarographic measurements obtained with a rotating platinum microelectrode established current-voltage curves. The compounds could be quantitatively oxidized to a free radical or to a sulfoxide by selection of suitable acid concentrations and applied potentials. Electroreduction of the free radicals occurs at approximately +0.25 volt vs. S.C.E. on a platinum electrode. In the case of the sulfoxides, a single 2-electron reduction step occurred at ca. -0.95 volt vs. S.C.E. on a mercury pool cathode. The determinations showed good reproducibility and an accuracy of ca. 1% was obtained with sample concentrations of 10-3 M or greater. {\textcopyright} 1964, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {Constrained least squares problems occur often in practice, mostly as sub-problems in many optimization contexts. For solving large and sparse instances of these problems on parallel architectures with distributed memory, the use of static data structures to represent the sparse matrix is preferred during the factorization. But the accurate detection of the rank of the constraint matrix is also very critical to the accuracy of the computed solution. In this work, we examine the solution of the constrained problem using weighting approach. We demonstrate that all computations can be carried out using a static data structure that is generated using the symbolic structure of the input matrices, making use of a recently proposed rank detection procedure. We show good speed-ups in solving large and sparse equality conditioned least squares problems on hypercubes up to 128 processors.},

abstract = {In this work, a new class of stochastic gradient algorithm is developed based on q-calculus. Unlike the existing q-LMS algorithm, the proposed approach fully utilizes the concept of q-calculus by incorporating a time-varying q parameter. The proposed enhanced q-LMS (Eq-LMS) algorithm utilizes a novel, parameterless concept of error-correlation energy and normalization of signal to ensure high convergence, stability and low steady-state error. The proposed algorithm automatically adapts the learning rate with respect to the error. For evaluation purposes the system identification problem is considered. The necessary condition of convergence for the proposed algorithm is analyzed, and the validation of analytical findings and simulation results is discussed. Extensive experiments show better performance of the proposed Eq-LMS algorithm compared to the standard q-LMS approach.},

@article{Fang2014,
abstract = {Observation systems known as errors-in-variables (EIV) models with model parameters estimated by total least squares (TLS) have been discussed for more than a century, though the terms EIV and TLS were coined much more recently. So far, it has only been shown that the inequality-constrained TLS (ICTLS) solution can be obtained by the combinatorial methods, assuming that the weight matrices of observations involved in the data vector and the data matrix are identity matrices. Although the previous works test all combinations of active sets or solution schemes in a clear way, some aspects have received little or no attention such as admissible weights, solution characteristics and numerical efficiency. Therefore, the aim of this study was to adjust the EIV model, subject to linear inequality constraints. In particular, (1) This work deals with a symmetrical positive-definite cofactor matrix that could otherwise be quite arbitrary. It also considers cross-correlations between cofactor matrices for the random coefficient matrix and the random observation vector. (2) From a theoretical perspective, we present first-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions and the second-order sufficient conditions of the inequality-constrained weighted TLS (ICWTLS) solution by analytical formulation. (3) From a numerical perspective, an active set method without combinatorial tests as well as a method based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is established. By way of applications, computational costs of the proposed algorithms are shown to be significantly lower than the currently existing ICTLS methods. It is also shown that the proposed methods can treat the ICWTLS problem in the case of more general weight matrices. Finally, we study the ICWTLS solution in terms of non-convex weighted TLS contours from a geometrical perspective. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The most accurate and robust fit is obtained by minimizing geometric (orthogonal) distances, but this problem has no closed form solution and most known algorithms are prohibitively slow. We revisit this issue based on recent advances by S. J. Ahn, D. Eberly, and our own. Ahn has sorted out various approaches and identified the most efficient one. Eberly has developed a fast method of projecting points onto ellipses/ellipsoids (and gave a proof of its convergence). We extend Eberly's projection algorithm to other conics, as well as quadrics in space. We also demonstrate that Eberly's projection method combined with Ahn's most efficient approach (and using Taubin's algebraic fit for initialization) makes a highly efficient fitting scheme working well for all quadratic curves and surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Therefore, this paper presents an inequality-constrained total least squares (ICTLS) solution for the EIV model with inequality constraints (denoted as ICEIV).

abstract = {Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images - two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets - consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

An automorphism T of (X, $\mu$) has the weak Pinsker property if for every $\epsilon$> 0 it has a splitting into a direct product of a Bernoulli shift and an automorphism of entropy less than $\epsilon$. This property was introduced by Thouvenot, who asked whether it holds for all ergodic automorphisms. This paper proves that it does. The proof actually gives a more general result. Firstly, it gives a relative version: any factor map from one ergodic automorphism to another can be enlarged by arbitrarily little entropy to become relatively Bernoulli. Secondly, using some facts about relative orbit equivalence, the analogous result holds for all free and ergodic measure-preserving actions of a countable amenable group. The key to this work is a new result about measure concentration. Suppose now that $\mu$ is a probability measure on a finite product space An, and endow this space with its Hamming metric. We prove that $\mu$ may be represented as a mixture of other measures in which (i) most of the weight in the mixture is on measures that exhibit a strong kind of concentration, and (ii) the number of summands is bounded in terms of the difference between the Shannon entropy of $\mu$ and the combined Shannon entropies of its marginals.},

abstract = {Adhesives are ubiquitous in daily life and industrial applications. They usually fall into one of two classes: strong but irreversible (e.g., superglues) or reversible/reusable but weak (e.g., pressure-sensitive adhesives and biological and biomimetic surfaces). Achieving both superstrong adhesion and reversibility has been challenging. This task is particularly difficult for hydrogels that, because their major constituent is liquid water, typically do not adhere strongly to any material. Here, we report a snail epiphragm-inspired adhesion mechanism where a polymer gel system demonstrates superglue-like adhesion strength (up to 892 N{\textperiodcentered}cm−2) that is also reversible. It is applicable to both flat and rough target surfaces. In its hydrated state, the softened gel conformally adapts to the target surface by low-energy deformation, which is locked upon drying as the elastic modulus is raised from hundreds of kilopascals to ∼2.3 GPa, analogous to the action of the epiphragm of snails. We show that in this system adhesion strength is based on the material's intrinsic, especially near-surface, properties and not on any near-surface structure, providing reversibility and ease of scaling up for practical applications.},

abstract = {How much can we infer about a person's looks from the way they speak? In this paper, we study the task of reconstructing a facial image of a person from a short audio recording of that person speaking. We design and train a deep neural network to perform this task using millions of natural Internet/Youtube videos of people speaking. During training, our model learns voice-face correlations that allow it to produce images that capture various physical attributes of the speakers such as age, gender and ethnicity. This is done in a self-supervised manner, by utilizing the natural co-occurrence of faces and speech in Internet videos, without the need to model attributes explicitly. We evaluate and numerically quantify how-and in what manner-our Speech2Face reconstructions, obtained directly from audio, resemble the true face images of the speakers.},

@article{Minev2019,
abstract = {In quantum physics, measurements can fundamentally yield discrete and random results. Emblematic of this feature is Bohr's 1913 proposal of quantum jumps between two discrete energy levels of an atom1. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement2–4. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Despite the non-deterministic character of quantum physics, is it possible to know if a quantum jump is about to occur? Here we answer this question affirmatively: we experimentally demonstrate that the jump from the ground state to an excited state of a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a predictable ‘flight', by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level coupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the evolution of each completed jump is continuous, coherent and deterministic. We exploit these features, using real-time monitoring and feedback, to catch and reverse quantum jumps mid-flight—thus deterministically preventing their completion. Our findings, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory5–9 and should provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as the early detection of error syndromes in quantum error correction.},

Training on much smaller training sets while maintaining nearly the same accuracy would be very beneficial. In the few-shot learning setting, a model must learn a new class given only a small number of samples from that class. One-shot learning is an extreme form of few-shot learning where the model must learn a new class from a single example. We propose the ‘less than one'-shot learning task where models must learn N new classes given only M < N examples and we show that this is achievable with the help of soft labels. We use a soft-label generalization of the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to explore the intricate decision landscapes that can be created in the ‘less than one'-shot learning setting. We analyze these decision landscapes to derive theoretical lower bounds for separating N classes using M < N soft-label samples and investigate the robustness of the resulting systems.},

In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation called dataset distillation: we keep the model fixed and instead attempt to distill the knowledge from a large training dataset into a small one. The idea is to synthesize a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data. For example, we show that it is possible to compress 60, 000 MNIST training images into just 10 synthetic distilled images (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few gradient descent steps, given a fixed network initialization. We evaluate our method in various initialization settings and with different learning objectives.

In this study, we used an activity-dependent tagging system in mice to determine the epigenetic state, 3D genome architecture and transcriptional landscape of engram cells over the lifespan of memory formation and recall. Our findings reveal that memory encoding leads to an epigenetic priming event, marked by increased accessibility of enhancers without the corresponding transcriptional changes. Memory consolidation subsequently results in spatial reorganization of large chromatin segments and promoter–enhancer interactions. Finally, with reactivation, engram neurons use a subset of de novo long-range interactions, where primed enhancers are brought in contact with their respective promoters to upregulate genes involved in local protein translation in synaptic compartments. Collectively, our work elucidates the comprehensive transcriptional and epigenomic landscape across the lifespan of memory formation and recall in the hippocampal engram ensemble.},

@article{Nguyen2020,
abstract = {Achieving super-human performance in recognizing human speech has been a goal for several decades, as researchers have worked on increasingly challenging tasks. In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two humans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as hesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate acoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and language context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only reach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%). Neural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have considerably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an integral fashion. However, processing such contexts requires an entire utterance presentation and thus introduces unwanted delays before a recognition result can be output. In this paper, we address performance as well as latency. We present results for a system that can achieve super-human performance (at a WER of 5.0%, over the Switchboard conversational benchmark) at a word based latency of only 1 second behind a speaker's speech. The system uses multiple attention-based encoder-decoder networks integrated within a novel low latency incremental inference approach.},

abstract = {In analysis-synthesis of musical sounds based on a sinusoidal model, the difference between the original signal and the synthesized signal, termed the residual, is typically a broadband noise process. It contains such musical phenomena as flute breath noise or violin bow noise. Synthesis without such 'noise' tends to sound artificial; it is desirable to improve the synthesis realism by modeling the residual in such a way that it can be reinjected in the synthesized signal. This paper deals with a model of noise perception based on the equivalent rectangular bands (ERBs) of the auditory system. Since a broadband noise is perceptually well-represented by the time-varying energy in each of these frequency bands, the residual is parametrized in terms of these energies in the proposed model. An application of the model to music synthesis based on the inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) is described in detail.},

abstract = {Innovation and creativity are key aspects of design and technological activity. The development of the polymer acoustic guitar at Loughborough University has been recognised as a highly innovative project having received three innovation awards from major bodies. This paper describes three key aspects of the development, in particular the capability to imagine future possibilities, the role of knowledge and appropriate prototyping. These aspects lie at the heart of the innovation, although, of course, the whole activity was supported by key design skills, such as drawing and CAD. Some aspects of design epistemology (ways of knowing that facilitate designing) are discussed using evidence from this project, for example, the roles of ‘knowing that' and ‘knowing how' and the supposed tension between ‘craft skills' and ‘modern technology'. The importance of fitness for purpose when prototyping is emphasised and the link to the problems associated with product outcomes and innovation noted. A model of design and technological activity is discussed which emphasises the role of knowledge in realising design possibilities. This model was first presented at DATA's Millennium Conference (Norman 2000) and is a modification of one discussed by Roberts (1992). It incorporates the idea of technology for design as the summation of knowledge, skills and values (Norman, 1998) and provides an alternative way of thinking about design and technological activity. It is argued that existing ideas surrounding ‘the design process', as represented by a series of stages derived from systems analysis, are a significant stumbling block to promoting innovation.},

Methodology/Principal Findings: Children who received at least three years (M=4.6 years) of instrumental music training outperformed their control counterparts on two outcomes closely related to music (auditory discrimination abilities and fine motor skills) and on two outcomes distantly related to music (vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning skills). Duration of training also predicted these outcomes. Contrary to previous research, instrumental music training was not associated with heightened spatial skills, phonemic awareness, or mathematical abilities. Conclusions/Significance: While these results are correlational only, the strong predictive effect of training duration suggests that instrumental music training may enhance auditory discrimination, fine motor skills, vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning. Alternative explanations for these results are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Forgeard et al.},

Music in FSMC is represented as a functional relationship between an existing human composition, or scaffold, and a generated accompaniment. This relationship is encoded by a type of artificial neural network called a compositional pattern producing network (CPPN). A human user without any musical expertise can then explore how accompaniment should relate to the scaffold through an interactive evolutionary process akin to animal breeding. While the power of such a functional representation has previously been shown to constrain the search to plausible accompaniments, this study goes further by showing that the user can tailor complete multipart arrangements from only a single original monophonic track provided by the user, thus enabling creativity without the need for musical expertise.},

However, it has thus far seen limited application to sequential data, and, as we demonstrate, existing recurrent VAE models have difficulty modeling sequences with long-term structure. To address this issue, we propose the use of a hierarchical decoder, which first outputs embeddings for subsequences of the input and then uses these embeddings to generate each subsequence independently. This structure encourages the model to utilize its latent code, thereby avoiding the "posterior collapse" problem which remains an issue for recurrent VAEs. We apply this architecture to modeling sequences of musical notes and find that it exhibits dramatically better sampling, interpolation, and reconstruction performance than a "flat" baseline model. An implementation of our "MusicVAE" is available online.2.},

abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {In this paper, a template adaptive drum transcription algorithm using partially fixed Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is presented. The proposed method detects percussive events in complex mixtures of music with a minimal training set. The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two dictionaries: a percussive dictionary initialized with pre-defined drum templates and a harmonic dictionary initialized with undefined entries. The harmonic dictionary is adapted to the non-percussive music content in a standard NMF procedure. The percussive dictionary is adapted to each individual signal in an iterative scheme: it is fixed during the decomposition process, and is updated based on the result of the previous convergence. Two template adaptation methods are proposed to provide more flexibility and robustness in the case of unknown data. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated and compared to state of the art systems. The results show that template adaptation improves the transcription performance, and the detection accuracy is in the same range as more complex systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a lightweight music-generating model based on variational autoencoder (VAE) with structured attention. Generating music is different from generating text because the melodies with chords give listeners distinguished polyphonic feelings. In a piece of music, a chord consisting of multiple notes comes from either the mixture of multiple instruments or the combination of multiple keys of a single instrument. We focus our study on the latter. Our model captures not only the temporal relations along time but the structure relations between keys. Experimental results show that our model has a better performance than baseline MusicVAE in capturing notes in a chord. Besides, our method accords with music theory since it maintains the configuration of the circle of fifths, distinguishes major and minor keys from interval vectors, and manifests meaningful structures between music phrases.},

abstract = {With respect to enormous inter-individual differences in sound perception, this article aims to review the research background of the neural basis of individual sound perception. Principally, two basic listening types can be distinguished: 'holistic' or 'synthetic' listeners recognize the sound as a whole, and appreciate its pitch and timbre as characteristic qualities of the entire sound; and 'spectral' or 'analytical' listeners break up the sound into its harmonic constituents, at the expense of timbral qualities of the sound as a whole. In-between these two extreme listening modes, intermediate listeners perceive holistic and spectral cues simultaneously to varying degrees (auditory ambiguity). Several recent neurological investigations have pinpointed these perceptual differences to neuroanatomical and neurophysiological measures of the auditory cortex. Furthermore, it has been shown that individual auditory perception bias corresponds to musical instrument preference and musical performance style. Multimodal research findings point towards an individual 'fingerprint' of auditory cortex and perception profiles; however, whether these properties are shaped by intense training or rather reflect innate, genetically determined predisposition remains a matter of unresolved debate. {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Recently, Agile development processes have become popular in the software development community, and have been shown to be effective in large organizations. However, given that the communication and cooperation dynamics in startup companies are very different from that of larger, more established companies, and the fact that the initial focus of a startup might be significantly different from its ultimate goal, it is questionable whether a rigid process model that works for larger companies is appropriate in tackling the problems faced by a startup. When we scale down even further and observe the small scale startup with only a few members, many of the same problems that Agile methodology sets out to solve do not even exist. Then, for a small scale startup, is it still worth putting the resources into establishing a process model? Do the benefits of adopting an Agile methodology outweigh the opportunity cost of spending the resources elsewhere? This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an Agile methodology in a small scale tech startup and compares it to other process models, such as the Waterfall model and Lean Startup. In determining whether a rigorous agile methodology is the best development strategy for small scale tech startups, we consider the metrics of cost, time, quality, and scope in light of the particular needs of small startup organizations, and present a case study of a company that has needed to answer this very question.},

abstract = {Abstract Pre-salt carbonate reservoirs from Santos Basin represent a great opportunity and probably the most important recent oil discovery. Tupi area (estimated to have recoverable volume of 5 to 8 bboe), which is the most known amongst several other leads in the cluster, is going to be a great insight for the production project. From the production point of view, this new frontier has technological challenges that are being addressed by PETROBRAS and partners. Special attention is being dedicated to anticipate solutions to potential problems. This will require a balance between innovative and field proven solutions. This paper addresses the most critical points, where Petrobras is making a great R&D effort, which are: Well technology, where casing stability, well cost and productivity are addressed, in a scenario of water depths beyond 2,200m, target depths greater than 5,000m, crossing salt layers that can reach 2,000m in thickness. Poorly known microbial carbonate reservoir, heterogeneous in vertical profile, spread over very large areas, with wettability concerns, requiring careful evaluation of the performance of the waterflooding method and EOR. Wax deposition, due to low temperature in the ocean bottom, imposing limitations to the subsea layout. Gas processing and exporting technologies concerning environmental issues: CO2 compact removal units aiming the minimization of emissions to the atmosphere. Production units placed in more than 2,000m water depth, with oceanic conditions quite severe and dealing with high CO2 content stream. These challenges deserve all Petrobras attention, but also count with the confidence in achieving good technological solutions, supported by the history of successful developments of the company. Introduction The history of success built by Petrobras in deep water Brazilian coast - mainly Campos Basin - was largely supported by successive discoveries of heavy oil in turbidite sandstones, step by step towards gradually deeper and deeper water depths (Carminatti et al., 2009). The Pre-salt discoveries of Santos Basin represent discovery of huge volumes of light oil (28 to 30 degrees API), with high gas content, in a very short time span, close the most important consuming centers in Southeastern Brazil, and formation tests in the first wells have presented very high flow rates with no indication of barriers. All are excellent news, although PETROBRAS and partners recognize that the Pre-salt of Santos Basin represents a challenging scenario: ultra-deep water (greater then 2,000 meters), deep carbonate reservoirs (deeper than 5,000 meters), spread over very large areas, with high gas-oil ratio (GOR in Tupi area greater than 200 m3/m3), CO2 content (8-12% in Tupi), high-pressure and low temperature, laying immediately bellow a thick salt layer (more than 2,000 meters of salt), located around 300 km from the coast, with oceanic conditions more severe than Campos Basin. This scenario demands using sometimes present day technology in the limit, and other times, adaption and development of technologies specific for such conditions. This paper addresses the most critical points to the development of production in the Pre-salt of Santos Basin, where Petrobras is making an R&D effort to develop and qualify new technologies, including well technology, reservoir technology, flow assurance, gas processing and exporting technologies, and production units. Additionally, the paper discusses briefly how PETROBRAS has organized its structure to face these technological challenges, including the creation of a technological program - PROSAL - focused on Pre-salt objectives.},

abstract = {Drilling and completing either exploratory or development wells in Pre-Salt prospects present several challenges. The wells are located in very deep waters, beyond 2,000 m WD and they are also deep wells, with more than 5,000 m TVD. Pressure and temperature is normal, but contaminants such as H2S and CO2 represent an additional difficulty. Most of all, drilling through salt layers as thick as 2,000 m presents the most challenging aspect of these wells. Directional, extended reach (ERW), horizontal and multilateral wells will be evaluated for production development, but the reservoir is a carbonate horizon just below the salt, meaning that high angle navigation and multilateral joints will be located inside the salt layers. These wells measured depths will reach 8,000 m or more. The salt geo-mechanical loads on the casing and cementing will require high strength materials and high capacity rig equipment. The competency of the salt formations and, most of all, of the carbonate reservoir, totaling more than 3,000 m to be drilled, will require special BHA and bit design to increase penetration rates, thus reducing rig time. Carbonate reservoir will require production liner, perforations/slots and stimulation treatments designed to maximize production. Although these challenges could be overcome today, with existing technology, due to the current high costs scenario, well construction time and risks must be minimized. Some technology development is already underway to address these issues, but most of the gains can be materialized without new technology, by proper engineering design, risk management and learning curve acceleration. After 8 wells drilled in Pre-Salt prospects, Petrobras has already gained important know-how in these projects, but there is still a long way ahead. In the following years, well construction campaign for an Extended Well Testing (EWT) and a Pilot Production System in the Tupi Pre-Salt area, plus additional exploration wells, will provide field test opportunities for development and optimization of well engineering techniques and equipment. This paper will present the highlights of Petrobras E&P program to make the best use of these opportunities to leverage the well construction learning curve.},

abstract = {Carbonate reservoirs contain expressive part of the world oil reserves. The exploitation of these resources, however, presents several challenges mainly associated with their complex pore geometry, large scale variation in permeability and sometimes unfavorable wettability. These challenges can become more significant when we move to a deep offshore environment. As offshore projects need to be planned well in advance, due to the lack of room in the platforms for future expansion, the pioneer application of EOR methods needs to be considered from the conceptual stage of the development. This paper addresses the approach used to design the development basis for Lula field, formerly known as Tupi area, in the Pre-Salt Cluster (SBPSC) in Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. It focuses on the strategy of phased development, dynamic data acquisition and actions to add flexibility to the production system and how to manage uncertainties. A comprehensive analysis of the existing uncertainties, such as the reservoir characterization, early water and gas breakthrough, bypassed oil saturation, flow assurance in deep water flowlines and CaCO 3 scale possibility in production wells, favored a phased development concept aiming to mitigate risks.. The approach used to cope with these uncertainties in a Pilot Project as well as in the future development scenarios is presented. Most of the discussion is focused on how to consider feasible Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques through Pilot testing and future implementation in large scale in the field. It comprises the investigation of different recovery processes and first field results, including miscible processes using hydrocarbon gas and CO2. To optimize the oil displacement, a water alternating gas (WAG) injection process is also being designed. After one and a half year of extended well test production and the implementation of the first Pilot project in January, 2011, results confirm the decision of providing additional flexibility to the project. Dynamic appraisal proved essential to assess reservoir connectivity, evaluate stimulation methods, support reservoir characterization studies and define aspects related to flow in subsea lines. The first results of the injection of the CO2 stream, separated from the associated gas in the Pilot project, indicate that the chosen strategy has potential to be a successful one. The continuing production and pressure data monitoring of the WAG implementation in the Pilot, from 2012 on, will provide a more definitive conclusion about the feasibility. Good responses will translate in the EOR expansion to field scale. Copyright 2012, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

Considering the importance of these reserves for the Brazilian economy and the opportunity to accelerate cash flow, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a fast track development, including extended well tests (EWTs) and production pilots. The current Petrobras Business Plan (2011-15) foresees mat the SBPSC areas alone will produce over 500,000 boe/d in 2015 and over 1,100,000 boe/d in 2020. These numbers refer only to Petrobras share and do not include me transfer of rights with economic compensation from the Brazilian government to Petrobras. Therefore, the initial development phase will have to cope with several uncertainties, mainly the subsurface ones. Some of the most relevant are the quality and the heterogeneity degree of each reservoir zone; the compositional grading of the fluids; the performance of different EOR methods; and the presence of fractures affecting the flow. How to specify and anticipate the acquisition of expensive equipment, such as FPSOs and subsea devices, with uncertainties to be clarified? When is it worth to invest in more data acquisition, such as EWTs, core and fluid sampling, extensive lab analysis or even more appraisal wells? The timing and the uncertainty reduction foreseen for each initiative must be taken into account. On the other hand, when is it better to pay for extra flexibilities, accepting the inevitable CAPEX increase? Some examples would be: smart completions and possibility to inject different chemical products in the wells; gas and water separated lines for each satellite injector; flexible subsea layout, allowing multiples strategies and the addition of more wells; FPSO plants designed to inject desulphated water, or to export, import or reinject me gas, and also to separate variable CO2 contents in the produced fluids. This paper aims to discuss the influence of the main subsurface uncertainties in the selection of alternatives to develop the giant fields in the SBPSC, in a fast track way.

abstract = {In the early 2000s the context of the pre-salt formations was conceptual geological models of possible oil bearing reservoirs underneath a thick salt layer, many technical challenges, uncertainties and risks. Past only eight years from first discovery (2006), there are nine production systems, FPSOs, in operation, reaching an average oil rate of more than 700 thousand barrels per day and a cumulative production greater than 400 million barrels of oil, through 34 production wells. To optimize recovery, the first desulfated sea water and gas injectors were started. But these impressive numbers cannot be taken from granted: although nature has revealed prolific reservoirs, much experience, talent, planning and perseverance were necessary. The first articles addressing the pre-salt fields had a focus on the technical challenges faced on first years: the heterogeneous nature of the microbial carbonate reservoir, the 2,000 m salt layer and drilling concerns associated, the variable CO2 content and compositional grading in the reservoir fluids, flow assurance issues and special demands concerning subsea engineering, well construction and processing plant. The main drivers and development strategies were also established: staged development, based on extended well tests (EWTs), multi well production pilots and definitive systems prioritizing the standardization of well projects and production systems. Now, challenges and plans are rewarding the efforts, as depicted by the concrete production numbers achieved to date. In this text, a historical perspective of the pre-salt exploration and development is presented, emphasizing the previous unknowns and uncertainties and how they were treated in order to attain the results. As we still have a lot to learn, since we are just on the beginning of the development of this extraordinary petroleum province, a look to the future and the present efforts on optimization are also commented.},

abstract = {This paper presents the successful history of Lula NE Pilot Project, a challenging megaproject with an aggressive time-driven schedule, faster than industry average, that demanded new technology development in a scenario of uncertainty. The area is part of the supergiant Lula field, located in the pre-salt region of Santos Basin, Southeast Brazil, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, in 2000 m water depth. It is a joint venture with Petrobras as the Operator, and BG E&P Brasil and Petrogal Brasil as partners. The project was designed as a Pilot aiming to test some new concepts for the production development in the pre-salt area. In terms of subsea gathering system, an innovative concept was deployed, combining flexible flowlines lying on sea floor, with rigid steel catenary risers (SCR) supported by a buoy positioned 250 m below sea level. The drainage plan considered eight oil producers, some of them with intelligent completion, one gas/CO2 injection well and five water alternating gas (WAG) injectors (two subsea WAG manifolds were also installed). A balanced approach between data acquisition and facilities flexibility made possible to face the many reservoir and production uncertainties. Details of the development concept will be discussed, as well as the main results obtained so far, highlighting the strategies adopted in order to mitigate risks and the influence of the acquired information to the following projects in the area. The chartered FPSO Cidade de Paraty started production in June 2013, with an oil capacity of 120,0 bpd, and a gas plant able to process up to 5 million m3/d of gas with 35% content of CO2. Despite all challenges faced, the project was delivered on time, with plateau attained in September 2014.},

abstract = {Critiques of urban renewal and large-scale developments were prominent in the period 1960-80. In particular, they emphasized the negative environmental and social consequences of these schemes and especially attacked them for displacing low-income and ethnically different populations. In the 1980s and 1990s, we saw a decline in such projects in many places, responding to popular protest and intellectual dissent, along with a new emphasis on preservation. More recently, however, we see the revival of mega-projects, often connected with tourism and sports development and incorporating the designs of world-famous architects. Frequently these are on landfill or abandoned industrial sites. The symposium for which this is an introduction shows the growing convergence of North American and European projects. This convergence is visible in their physical form, their financing, and in the role played by the state in a world marked by neoliberalism. At the same time, the new projects do display a greater environmental sensitivity and commitment to urbanity than the modernist schemes of an earlier epoch. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

Second, total global megaproject spending is assessed, at US$6 to US$9 trillion annually, or 8% of the total global gross domestic product (GDP), which denotes the biggest investment boom in human history. Third, four "sublimes" - political, technological, economic, and aesthetic - are identified and used to explain the increased size and frequency of megaprojects. Fourth, the "iron law of megaprojects" is laid out and documented: Over budget, over time, over and over again. Moreover, the "break-fix model" of megaproject management is introduced as an explanation of the iron law. Fifth, Albert O. Hirschman's theory of the "Hiding Hand" is revisited and critiqued as unfounded and corrupting for megaproject thinking in both the academy and policy. Sixth, it is shown how megaprojects are systematically subject to "survival of the unfittest," which explains why the worst projects get built rather than the best. Finally, it is argued that the conventional way of managing megaprojects has reached a "tension point," in which tradition is being challenged and reform is emerging. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Project Management Institute.},

Since complex physical phenomena of contact among objects and fingers makes it difficult to perform the bin-picking with high success rate, we consider introducing a learning based approach. For the purpose of collecting enough number of training data within a reasonable period of time, we introduce a physics simulator where approximation is used for collision checking. In this paper, we first formulate the learning based robotic bin-picking by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). We also obtain the optimum grasping posture of parallel jaw gripper by using CNN. Finally, we show that the effect of approximation introduced in collision checking is relaxed if we use exact 3D model to generate the depth image of the pile as an input to CNN.},

abstract = {In recent years, much attention has been focused on research to replace petroleum-based commodity plastics, in a cost-effective manner, with biodegradable materials offering competitive mechanical properties. Biopolymers have been considered as the most promising materials for this purpose. However, they generally present poor mechanical properties regarding processability and end-use application, since the fragility and brittleness exhibited during thermoformation can limit their potential for application. In order to overcome this problem, plasticizers are added to provide the necessary workability to biopolymers. This class of products became more visible when biodegradable additives and plasticizers also became the focus of material scientists. The use of natural and/or biodegradable plasticizers, with low toxicity and good compatibility with several plastics, resins, rubber and elastomers in substitution of conventional plasticizers, such as phthalates and other synthetic conventional plasticizers attracted the market along with the increasing worldwide trend towards use of biopolymers. Here we discuss the main results and developments in natural plasticizer/synthetic and biopolymer-based films during the last decades. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Granular potato starch was plasticized with different amounts of glycerol and water by extrusion. The materials were amorphous directly after processing. During aging above the glass transition temperature at various humidities single helical (V and E-type) and double helical (B-type) crystallinity was formed. The rate of crystallization is a function of water and glycerol content. The amorphous rubbery materials were soft and weak with high elongations. During aging the materials became less flexible with higher elastic modulus and tensile stress. The changes are related to changes in water content and glass transition temperature and to changes in B-type crystallinity. The changes in stress-strain properties are explained by the formation of helical structures and crystals, which results in a reinforcement of the starch network by physical crosslinking. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

This paper discusses the various technologies being used to produce polylactic acids. In addition, attention is drawn to how monomer stereochemistry can be controlled to impart targeted utility in the final polymers. Specific applications are described to illustrate further the range of properties that can be developed by utilising both the basic monomer/polymer chemistries in combination with post-modification techniques.

The biodegradability tests were performed in liquid medium (modified Sturm test) and in farmland soil. All gluten materials were fully degraded after 36 days in aerobic fermentation and within 50 days in farmland soil. No significant differences were observed between the samples. The mineralization half-life time of 3.8 days in the modified Sturm test situated gluten materials among fast degrading polymers. The tests of microbial inhibition experiments revealed no toxic effects of the modified gluten or of its metabolites. Thus, the protein bulk of wheat gluten materials is non-toxic and fully biodegradable, whatever the technological process applied. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Pulp and paper industry expresses an interest in adapting and integrating advanced biomass energy conversion technologies into its mill operations. Industrial adoption of these new technologies has the potential for higher efficiency, lower capital cost, and safer operation than conventional operations that bum fossil fuels for energy.

The energy and materials needed to sustain the present society are derived primarily from non-renewable fossil resources, which will be depleted at some point. Plastics are one example of an important commodity in the modern lifestyle. While plastics are undoubtedly superior materials in terms of their costs, processability and functional properties, they are currently derived from fossil resources and they are not readily assimilated by the various ecosystems upon disposal. The search for biodegradable plastics that are derived from renewable resources has been ongoing since the 1970s. Two of the most promising biobased plastics, i.e., polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates, have received much attention as potential alternatives to existing processes. This article will discuss the current status and sustainability of these two next generation biobased plastics by taking into consideration the raw materials required, as well as the post-consumption effects of these materials on the environment. In addition, important issues surrounding the development and sustainability of biobased and biodegradable plastics will be highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recent technologies are directed towards the development of bio-green materials that exert negligible side- effects on the environment. A biologically-synthesized plastic, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), has been attracting major interests due to its similar physical properties to synthetic plastics. Unlike synthetic plastics, PHA is produced from renewable resources and is degraded aerobically by microorganisms to CO2 and H2O upon disposal. The selections of suitable bacterial strains, inexpensive carbon sources, efficient fermentation and recovery processes are important aspects that should be taken into consideration for the commercialization of PHA. This chapter discusses economical strategies to reduce production costs of PHA as well as its applications in various fields.},

Such information has allowed the creation and formal recognition of the closely related genera Gordonia , Tsukamurella and Dietzia to include isolates once placed unconvincingly in the genus Rhodococcus , and the re-assignment of former members of Nocardia and Tsukamurella to it. However, several taxonomic difficulties remain. Where to place Rhodococcus equi is still problematic, and many Rhodococcus isolates, some probably representing new species, have never been formally described.

abstract = {Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have recently been the focus of attention as a biodegradable and biocompatible substitute for conventional non degradable plastics. The cost of large-scale production of these polymers has inhibited its widespread use. Thus, economical, large-scale production of PHAs is currently being studied intensively. Various bacterial strains, either wild-type or recombinant have been utilized with a wide spectrum of utilizable carbon sources. New fermentation strategies have been developed for the efficient production of PHAs at high concentration and productivity. With the current advances, PHAs can now be produced to a concentration of 80 g L-1 with productivities greater than 4 g PHA L-1 h-1. These advanceswill further lower the production cost of PHAs and allow this family of polymers to become a leading biodegradable polymer in the near future. This review describes the properties of PHAs, their uses, the various attempts towards the production of PHAs, focusing on the utilization of cheap substrates and the development of different fermentation strategies for the production of these polymers, an essential step forward towards their widespread use. {\textcopyright}2010 Society of Chemical Industry.},

The aim of the study was to identify key elements to comprehend the systemic structure of interaction among the ties of this chain. The study was held by a team of specialists over five months, including 15 meetings. Discussions were based on quantitative and qualitative data and a systemic map was constructed and refined. Based on this modeling, four different prospective scenarios were comparatively analyzed in order to propose strategic actions to promote the sustainability and competitiveness of the chain. The results were then presented to two different groups of external specialists in order to validate the conclusions drawn and the proposals. Both groups agreed with the ideas presented. The paper is constructed as follows: a brief introduction focusing on contextual elements of the biodiesel production in Brazil and in Rio Grande do Sul; some background material regarding agroindustrial production chains and an overview of the biodiesel production chain of interest; a description of the method used to perform the research; main results and discussion; and conclusions.

Six isolates yielding high levels of reuterin with respect to type strain Lactobacillus reuteri CECT 925T were identified as Lact. reuteri. They were able to survive at pH 3 and subsequent exposure to cholic acid or oxgall, and presented bile salt hydrolase and bacteriocin-like activities. Conclusions: Reuterin production is a frequently found trait among lactobacilli isolated from pig faeces. Selected Lact. reuteri isolates were able to survive at conditions likely to be encountered throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

@article{Philp2013,
abstract = {Society is fundamentally ambivalent to the use of plastics. On the one hand, plastics are uniquely flexible materials that have seen them occupy a huge range of functions, from simple packing materials to complex engineering components. On the other hand, their durability has raised concerns about their end-of-life disposal. When that disposal route is landfill, their invulnerability to microbial decomposition, combined with relatively low density and high bulk, means that plastics will occupy increasing amounts of landfill space in a world where available suitable landfill sites is shrinking.The search for biodegradable plastics and their introduction to the marketplace would appear to be a suitable amelioration strategy for such a problem. And yet the uptake of biodegradable plastics has been slow. The term biodegradable itself has entered public controversy, with accidental and intended misuse of the term; the intended misuse has led to accusations and instances of 'greenwashing'. For this and other reasons standards for biodegradability and compostability testing of plastics have been sought.An environmental dilemma with more far-reaching implications is climate change. The need for rapid and deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts is one of the drivers for the resurgence of industrial biotechnology generally, and the search for bio-based plastics more specifically. Bio-based has come to mean plastics based on renewable resources, but this need not necessarily imply biodegradability. If the primary purpose is GHG emissions savings, then once again plastics durability can be a virtue, if the end-of-life solution can be energy recovery during incineration or recycling. The pattern of production is shifting from the true biodegradable plastics to the bio-based plastics, and that trend is likely to persist into the future.This paper looks at aspects of the science of biodegradable and bio-based plastics from the perspective of policy advisers and makers. It is often said that the bioplastics suffer from a lack of a favourable policy regime when compared to the wide-ranging set of policy instruments that are available on both the supply and demand side of biofuels production. Some possible policy measures are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The process afforded short, rod-like CNCs with particle diameter ranging from 10 to 12nm and crystallinity index of 76.1%. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the CNCs also confirmed absorption patterns typical of cellulose and the removal of silica. Bioplastic with different starch-to-CNC ratios were prepared by solution casting and evaporation method. Scanning electron micrographs of the films showed uniform dispersion of CNC in the starch matrix. Mechanical tests revealed that both tensile strength and modulus significantly increased with increasing CNC load while percent elongation decreased. The moisture uptake of the films reinforced with CNC also decreased an indication of improvement in water resistance. However, the thermal stability of the films decreased by the addition of CNC.},

abstract = {There has been a considerable increase on research of the ecological consequences of microplastics released into the environment, but only a handful of works have focused on the nano-sized particles of polymer-based materials. Though their presence has been difficult to adequately ascertain, due to the inherent technical difficulties for isolating and quantifying them, there is an overall consensus that these are not only present in the environment - either directly released or as the result of weathering of larger fragments - but that they also pose a significant threat to the environment and human health, as well. The reduced size of these particulates (<1 $\mu$m) makes them susceptible of ingestion by organisms that are at the base of the food-chain. Moreover, the characteristic high surface area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles may add to their potential hazardous effects, as other contaminants, such as persistent organic pollutants, could be adsorbed and undergo bioaccumulation and bioamplification phenomena. In this review, we describe the most relevant sources of nanoplastics and offer some insights into their fate once released into the environment. Furthermore, we overviewthemost prominent effects of these small particulates, while identifying the key challenges scientists currently face in the research of nanoplastics in the environment. Lastly, we give a brief summary of the economic impacts of the pollution caused by plastic litter - a potential key source of nanoplastics - in the oceans, the most common destination of these contaminants.},

abstract = {Ocean plastic can persist in sea surface waters, eventually accumulating in remote areas of the world's oceans. Here we characterise and quantify a major ocean plastic accumulation zone formed in subtropical waters between California and Hawaii: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). Our model, calibrated with data from multi-vessel and aircraft surveys, predicted at least 79 (45-129) thousand tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million km2; a figure four to sixteen times higher than previously reported. We explain this difference through the use of more robust methods to quantify larger debris. Over three-quarters of the GPGP mass was carried by debris larger than 5 cm and at least 46% was comprised of fishing nets. Microplastics accounted for 8% of the total mass but 94% of the estimated 1.8 (1.1-3.6) trillion pieces floating in the area. Plastic collected during our study has specific characteristics such as small surface-to-volume ratio, indicating that only certain types of debris have the capacity to persist and accumulate at the surface of the GPGP. Finally, our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.},

Bioplastic can help reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and petroleum, that bioplastic can solve the problem of synthetic plastic use. This research aims to define the properties of the cassava starch-based bioplastic reinforced by nanoclay. Methods were experimental with bioplastic component of cassava starch, glycerol as plasticizer and nanoclay as reinforcement. The bioplastic was analyzed using XRD, tensile test, moisture absorption, biodegradability, and compared with another bioplastic. The results show that the addition of nanoclay into bioplastic results increasing the tensile strength of bioplastic also increases from 5.2 MPa to 6.3 MPa.

PHAs are green plastics and they have positive social and environmental impact when compared with conventional plastics in terms of production and recycling. Moreover, PHAs do not possess acute and chronic health effects when used in vivo. These bioplastics represent a renewable and sustainable resource to reduce landfill requirements without being persistence or causing pollution. A wide range of carbon sources, bacterial strains, fermentation conditions and recovery methods have been purposed by various researchers for better yield and economical perspectives. Recent advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering has led to the production of PHAs from non-PHAs producing strains with no toxins. Progression in recovery techniques has improved the extraction efficacy from biomass with high purity.

This study presents a new biopolymer (sugar palm starch) for the preparation of biodegradable packaging films using a solution casting technique. The effect of different plasticizer types (glycerol (G), sorbitol (S) and glycerol-sorbitol (GS) combination) with varying concentrations (0, 15, 30 and 45, w/w%) on the tensile, thermal and barrier properties of sugar palm starch (SPS) films was evaluated. Regardless of plasticizer types, the tensile strength of plasticized SPS films decreased, whereas their elongation at break (E%) increased as the plasticizer concentrations were raised. However, the E% for G and GS-plasticized films significantly decreased at a higher plasticizer concentration (45% w/w) due to the anti-plasticization effect of plasticizers. Change in plasticizer concentration showed an insignificant effect on the thermal properties of S-plasticized films. The glass transition temperature of SPS films slightly decreased as the plasticizer concentration increased from 15% to 45%. The plasticized films exhibited increased water vapor permeability values from 4.855 × 10<sup>-10</sup> to 8.70 × 10<sup>-10</sup> g{\textperiodcentered}m<sup>-1</sup>{\textperiodcentered}s<sup>-1</sup>{\textperiodcentered}Pa<sup>-1</sup>, irrespective of plasticizer types.

Therefore, in the past decade, a number of major industries, such as the automotive, construction and packaging industries, have shown a considerable interest in the progress of new natural fiber reinforced composite materials. The availability of natural fibers and the ease of manufacturing have tempted researchers to study their feasibility of their application as reinforcement and the extent to which they satisfy the required specifications in tribological applications. However, less information concerning the tribological performance of natural fiber reinforced composite material is available in the literature. Hence, the aim of this bibliographic review is to demonstrate the tribological behavior of natural fiber reinforced composites and find a knowledge about their usability for various applications that tribology plays a dominant role. This review presents the reported work on natural fiber reinforced composites with special reference to the type of fibers, matrix polymers, treatment of fibers and test parameters. The results show that composites reinforced with natural fibers have an improvement in tribological properties and their properties are comparable with conventional fibers. In addition, fiber treatment and fiber orientation are two important factors can affect tribological properties where treated fibers and normal oriented fibers exhibit better friction and wear behavior. This review is trying to evaluate the effect of test parameter including normal load and sliding speed on tribological properties, and the results vary based on type of reinforcement. Generally, due to their positive economic and environmental aspects, as well as their good tribological properties, natural composites are showing a good potential for employing in several applications.},

In Growing Design, designers operate in interdisciplinary contexts, engaging in early stage material developments. Despite the widespread interest towards Growing Design, no systematic study has been conducted so far to understand how this practice unfolds and its contribution to the progression towards cleaner production. To this end, eight recognized professionals in the field were interviewed. The results illustrate how the conception of materials in design evolves when designers co-perform with biological organisms. This alters how the design process unfolds and the mindset adopted in design practice, shaping a novel, systemic vision on production and consumption practices.

Biodegradable plastics and bio-based polymer products based on annually renewable agricultural and biomass feedstock can form the basis for a portfolio of sustainable, eco-efficient products that can compete and capture markets currently dominated by products based exclusively on petroleum feedstock. Natural/Biofiber composites (Bio-Composites) are emerging as a viable alternative to glass fiber reinforced composites especially in automotive and building product applications. The combination of biofibers such as kenaf, hemp, flax, jute, henequen, pineapple leaf fiber, and sisal with polymer matrices from both nonrenewable and renewable resources to produce composite materials that are competitive with synthetic composites requires special attention, i.e., biofiber-matrix interface and novel processing. Natural fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites have attained commercial attraction in automotive industries. Natural fiber - polypropylene or natural fiber - polyester composites are not sufficiently eco-friendly because of the petroleum-based source and the nonbiodegradable nature of the polymer matrix. Using natural fibers with polymers based on renewable resources will allow many environmental issues to be solved. By embedding biofibers with renewable resource-based biopolymers such as cellulosic plastics; polylactides; starch plastics; polyhydroxyalkanoates (bacterial polyesters); and soy-based plastics, the so-called green bio-composites are continuously being developed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Plastics have transformed everyday life; usage is increasing and annual production is likely to exceed 300 million tonnes by 2010. In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in plastic, the leaching of chemicals from plastic products and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, the deployment of sustainable product design has led to a dramatic increase in the use of bio-plastics as an environmentally sensitive substitute to regular petroleum-based ones. Published literature has explored the environmental performance and their suitability as an alternative for regular plastics. However, the reception of these materials by users, who come into contact with these materials embodied in consumer products, has not been researched and published. Even though the principle of using such materials with improved environmental credentials is sound, it is down to the users' appreciation of those materials that ultimately determine their commercial success. A significant challenge faced by material developers and product designers is to facilitate the appraisal of bio-plastics as a natural alternative to regular plastics, whilst at the same time meeting users' perceptions of quality. Drawing on the results of an empirical study this paper discusses when a material is perceived as 'natural' and/or 'high- quality'. The study concludes that there are more contradictory aspects than congruent aspects when evoking these two meanings. Imposition of new aesthetic values and uniqueness are discussed as critical strategies to elicit the desired meanings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bioplastics play an increasingly important role for consumer products. These new materials might increase product sustainability but they are currently confined to niche markets. While research has gained important insight into the technical challenges, few studies to date explore the behavioral aspects for product developers as they move to employ bioplastics in their development efforts. This manuscript reports the findings of a grounded inductive study based on interview data with 32 product developers in the consumer goods industry. The Theory of Planned Behavior is employed to guide the research and provide a theoretical background to derive implications. The study finds that behavioral challenges impede the increased use of bioplastics. Product developers experience a lack of perceived behavioral control and struggle with doubts about the environmental benefits and incurring trade-offs of bioplastics with respect to the Triple Bottom Line. While product developers are intrinsically motivated to make more use of bioplastics, they often refrain from bringing products to the mass market due to uncertainties of customer receptiveness and fears of greenwashing allegations. Implications for industry and research are detailed.},

abstract = {This study explores people's perceptions (i.e., positive and negative associations, mixed feelings) regarding the concept of 'bio-based' in general and specific bio-based products. This exploratory study is one of the first consumer studies in the field of bio-based research. Three focus group discussions were organized in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands (with 89 participants in total) in which projective techniques were applied. Results of these group discussions indicate that participants are unfamiliar with 'bio-based' as a concept. 'Bio-based' is most often associated with positive environmental issues as "naturalness" and "environmental friendly" but also with negative environmental associations and to a lesser extent with technological and health issues. Associations with 'bio-based' as a general concept and with particular bio-based products can be simultaneously positive and negative, which caused uncertainty and mixed feelings by the respondents. This idea highlights both the complexity of and a lack of familiarity with the concept of 'bio-based'. Consumers have a holistic perception of bio-based products, i.e., they combine their perception of different aspects of the product in an evaluation of the whole product concept (e.g., their perception of the original product, usability, production method, proportion of bio-based materials used, price, packaging material, and appearance). Discussions on 'bio-based' as a concept are more general and abstract, while discussions and associations related to bio-based products are more specific. This study's qualitative approach illustrates in detail the great variety in consumers' perceptions, which can be both cognitive and affective (including positive, negative and mixed feelings towards 'bio-based' as a concept as well as bio-based products).},

However, the real challenge is to create new materials from food waste and not from specially grown crops, whose production in any case comes at an environmental cost. In recent years, the testing of substances made from food waste has increased significantly; the sheer abundance of raw materials that can be used to make them has encouraged institutional research, as well as an approach to project development that has been widely embraced by the many young designers who craft these materials. This paper considers all aspects of these materials, starting from a historical overview. It presents interesting experiments underway and envisages possible future scenarios.},

They can be totally new materials, modified, or further developed versions of existing materials. In order to provide an operational vocabulary to discuss DIY materials, we have collected 27 DIY material cases developed in the last five years. We group the collected cases under two main categories: (1) DIY new materials: which focus on creative material ingredients (e.g. a material made of dried, blended waste citrus peel combined with natural binders); and (2) DIY new identities for conventional materials: which focus on new production techniques, giving new expressions to existing materials (i.e. they do not necessarily contain new ingredients, such as 3D printed metal). Grounded on the commonalities of collected cases, we discuss the design opportunities, including new aesthetic impressions offered through DIY material design practices.},

abstract = {Materials research constantly offers novel materials as better alternatives to convention. Functional aptness is taken for granted at the first commercial launch of a new material. Nevertheless, this alone may not be enough for its commercial success and widespread use. The ‘material' should also elicit meaningful user experiences in and beyond its utilitarian assessment. This requires qualifying the material not only for what it is, but also for what it does, what it expresses to us, what it elicits from us, and what it makes us do. In search of a proper application through such an understanding, material scientists and industries have reached out to designers to guide the development of materials by experiential goals. However, how to design for experiences with and for a material at hand has been poorly addressed to date. In this article, we propose a method, Material Driven Design (MDD), to facilitate designing for material experiences. After explaining the theoretical foundation of the method, an illustrative case is presented—where ‘coffee waste' is the subject of a design effort to conceive a new product concept. Finally, possible research directions are addressed to bring new insights to the effective application of the MDD method to diverse projects.},

The aim of this paper is to shed light on what it means to design with growing organisms as collaborators, identifying the defining traits of this novel, designerly way of 'doing materials'. To do so, we first compare this specific approach to the approaches of others working in the intersections of biology and design. In this way, we outline the boundaries of Growing Design, defining its unique characteristics. We then provide detailed descriptions of three classes of Growing Materials: fungal, bacterial and algal materials. For each class, we bring two examples of designers utilizing these materials for industrial design purposes. This helps to further explain what truly distinguishes Growing Materials from other conventional materials and to understand the challenges in working with them. Finally, this discussion enables us to set out a research agenda for Growing Design, supporting the development of these materials for industrial production.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the demand for fossil fuels is quite high. But, the extensive use of fossil fuels is causing the gradual decrease of fossil fuels. Therefore, a way to get rid of widespread of using fossil fuels is by developing a new renewable source that can benefit our environment. Resin is one of the important polymeric in the chemical industry. Resins such as alkyd resins are widely used in coatings and paint industry. There are many researches about producing a resin from renewable sources such as vegetable oils. The naturally used vegetable oils in producing resin are soyabean, rapeseed, coconut, castor or linseed oils. Other than that, there are many potential vegetable oils such as karawila, nahar, rubber or safflower oil. Scientist and engineers are dedicated to find another alternative to replace using fossil fuels as the main components in resin making. This study was inspired to do a research by using palm oil as the main components in making renewable resin or bio resin. In this study, waste cooking oil was used as the main component in making bio resin. The synthesis of resin begins with alcoholysis of waste cooking oil with glycerol followed by esterification process. Then, the monoglyceride was reacted with anhydride to obtain bio resin. The resulting product which is bio resin was characterized for physiochemical properties, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the infrared spectrum using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), melting point using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The result was compared with previous literature about producing resin from renewable material such as karawila seed oil. The expected resin is feasible in replacing synthetic resin. Thus, improvements and more research need to be made as to market the resin.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Publishing research results is an integral part of a researcher's professional life. However, writing is not every researcher's favourite activity, and getting a paper published can be a very tedious and time-consuming process. Fortunately, many of the obstacles along the writing and publishing path can be avoided by following some simple guidelines and practices. This paper presents a synthesis of guidelines found in literature about structuring and writing scientific papers. The paper outlines the process of publishing research papers in journals and conference proceedings, aiming to provide early-stage researchers with a handy introduction to essential issues. The paper takes an interdisciplinary stance by giving examples from technology-enhanced learning research and borrowing from literature in social, natural and computing sciences.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study to determine the effectiveness of mock up trainer model in order to improve student's performance in test and repair wiring/lighting system, car alarm system and servicing central locking system. This study adopted one group before and after experimental research design in conducting and gathering information. The training and instruments were administered to 40 third year students in Bukidnon State University, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. Furthermore, this study used descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean, percentages and standard deviation to describe the respondents. The study utilized the F-test and t-test to establish the difference and regression analysis to measure the extent of effect of input and process variables to output variable. The study found out that the instructional trainer has yielded is positive significance in the program status and highly significant in pre-test result. These are in terms of its effects in output variable and written post-test evaluation. The effect is negative and significant in parent's monthly income, significant in pre-test practical and input process variable's effect in post-test practical evaluation. The following conclusions and implications were drawn. The mock up trainer has been instrumental in improving student's score in test and repair wiring/lighting system, servicing car alarm system and a servicing central locking system. This is because the trainer serves as the medium of instruction to help develop the learning of the students for the automotive electrical system, car alarm with central locking system and other automotive vehicle accessories such as ignition system. Understanding such basic principles will enable the students to be self-reliant, more confident of themselves and they will be able to perform auto electrical and car alarm with central locking system installation and trouble-shooting circuits.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Sem deixar de apresentar os rasgos estil{\'{i}}sticos insepar{\'{a}}veis de sua obra, o autor monta uma estrutura que torna toda a pesquisa, com a qual renovou a linguagem liter{\'{a}}ria brasileira — com inova{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es formais, aproveitamento da linguagem coloquial e da fala popular —, mais assimil{\'{a}}vel pelo leitor. O t{\'{i}}tulo deste livro, no entanto, requer uma explica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, como j{\'{a}} observou Paulo R{\'{o}}nai. “Est{\'{o}}ria” {\'{e}} o neologismo que distingue a hist{\'{o}}ria como conto — isto {\'{e}}, relato de acontecimentos fict{\'{i}}cios — da hist{\'{o}}ria como registro de acontecimentos reais da vida de povos e pa{\'{i}}ses.

Os temas destas est{\'{o}}rias s{\~{a}}o m{\'{u}}ltiplos, e diversas tamb{\'{e}}m as situa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es, os problemas e suas solu{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es.

abstract = {Why does a harpsichord sound different from a piano? For that matter, why does middle C on a piano differ from middle C on a tuning fork, a trombone, or a flute? Good Vibrations explains in clear, friendly language the out-of-sight physics responsible not only for these differences but also for the whole range of noises we call music. The physical properties and history of sound are fascinating to study. Barry Parker's tour of the physics of music details the science of how instruments, the acoustics of rooms, electronics, and humans create and alter the varied sounds we hear. Using physics as a base, Parker discusses the history of music, how sounds are made and perceived, and the various effects of acting on sounds. In the process, he demonstrates what acoustics can teach us about quantum theory and explains the relationship between harmonics and the theory of waves. Peppered throughout with anecdotes and examples illustrating key concepts, this invitingly written book provides a firm grounding in the actual and theoretical physics of music. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Johns Hopkins University Press.

Musical examples and specific musical instruments demonstrate the principles. The book begins with a study of vibrations and waves, in that order. These topics constitute the basic physical properties of sound, one of two pillars supporting the science of musical acoustics. The second pillar is the human element, the physiological and psychological aspects of acoustical science. The perceptual topics include loudness, pitch, tone color, and localization of sound. With these two pillars in place, it is possible to go in a variety of directions. The book treats in turn, the topics of room acoustics, audio both analog and digital, broadcasting, and speech. It ends with chapters on the traditional musical instruments, organized by family. The mathematical level of this book assumes that the reader is familiar with elementary algebra. Trigonometric functions, logarithms and powers also appear in the book, but computational techniques are included as these concepts are introduced, and there is further technical help in appendices.},

With the help of numerous examples, these questions are addressed in detail. The authors focus in particular on the significant results obtained in the field during the last fifteen years. Their goal is to show that elementary physical models can be used with benefit for various applications in sound synthesis, instrument making, and sound recording. The book is primarily addressed to graduate students and researchers; however it could also be of interest for engineers, musicians, craftsmen, and music lovers who wish to learn about the basics of musical acoustics.},

abstract = {The great importance of music in Etruscan civilization is attested by several ancient Greek and Latin authors, who place a strong emphasis on the aerophones such as auloi, conches, horns, and trumpets of various kinds-namely the Latin cornu, lituus, and tuba. This assertion has been confirmed in recent times by various scholars, who also take into account the large number of musical instruments and the wide range of iconographic evidence that have been found at Etruscan sites, which span from the beginning of the seventh century to the first century BCE. While the only specimens that survive are, of course, those made of nonperishable materials like metal or clay, the iconographic evidence-such as the tomb paintings and other kinds of representations-clearly show that almost all of the musical instruments that were widespread in the Mediterranean at the time were also used in Etruria on many different occasions, including public and private ceremonies, rituals, and daily life. Tantalizing glimpses of the earlier presence of perishable instruments-such as wooden pipes and string instruments-are provided by the surviving parts made of ivory or bone, including a few pipes, joints between pipe and reed, and plectra. One notable feature in the Etruscan context seems to be the complete lack of membranophones-in particular the frame drum-which had still not appeared by the turn of the fifth century, and by which time all of the other musical instruments were already firmly established in the area.},

abstract = {I am not going to go into too much detail on 3D Modelling and animation. If you need more help than I offer here, you may need to learn a few modelling basics. This is a topic in itself and way too comprehensive to cover here. I will eventually write up a walkthrough of creating an MDL from beginning to end. Feel free to email me if you have some specific questions. I use Lightwave 3D v5 for modelling and animating models for quake. All of the models in X-MEN Quake are created specifically and individually for each character. I use bones to animate the meshes. I will be describing some methods for doing things here that I have found to be the best. These methods are for Lightwave 3d, Util3D, and QuakeMe, and not necessarily useful for other modellers or editors. When first creating your model, keep an eye on the polygon count. As you will be creating the model with quads, double the count for the total number. Apparently if your models are over 500 poly's they slow the game considerably, so keep them simple. The player model is 408 poly's (including weapons) and my models for X-MEN Quake are all between 400 and 500 poly's. This seems to be a good number, allowing for enough detail while not slowing the game. Remember to triangulate your model once it is finished. I originally created my models to the scale of the player mesh that I had extracted but didn't take into account the scale factor in the modelgen script, resulting in them being way too big. But then when I scaled them down, the texture that was created was too small. I finally created the base frame to the scale of the player mesh, which gave me a good texture size, and scaled the animation frames to 0.4 of the base, which made the MDL the right scale for the game. So make sure that if you extract a frame from an existing MDL for size reference, that you set the scale in the modelgen script to "1". When animating, preview at 10 frames per second. This is the speed you will see most of the},

It explores probabilistic models of supervised learning problems, and addresses the key statistical and computational questions. Research on pattern classification with binary-output networks is surveyed, including a discussion of the relevance of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Estimates of this dimension are calculated for several neural network models. A model of classification by real-output networks is developed, and the usefulness of classification with a large margin is demonstrated. The authors explain the role of scale-sensitive versions of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension in large margin classification, and in real estimation. They also discuss the computational complexity of neural network learning, describing a variety of hardness results, and outlining two efficient constructive learning algorithms. The book is self-contained and is intended to be accessible to researchers and graduate students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics.},

@book{Andersen1986,
abstract = {Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a compre- hensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma- chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es- sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {This book is based on the author's experience with calculations involving polynomial splines. It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

This paper\nproposes a new labeling scheme, based on the work of\nP.{$\sim$}de{$\sim$}Casteljau. The key idea is a classical\nmathematical principle, which we christen the\nBlossoming Principle: a univariate polynomial of degree\nn is equivalent to a symmetric polynomial in n\nvariables that is linear in each variable separately.\nBlossoming a B{{\'{e}}}zier curve or surface provides lucid\nlabels both for its B{{\'{e}}}zier points and for all of\nthe intermediate points that arise in the de Casteljau\nAlgorithm. Blossoming a spline curve with parametric\ncontinuity provides lucid labels for its de Boor points\nand for the points that arise in the de Boor Algorithm.\nSpline curves with geometric continuity and spline\nsurfaces with triangular patches present unsolved\nlabeling challenges, however. consists of a sequence of\nB{{\'{e}}}zier (i.e., parametric polynomial) curve segments\nmeeting at joints with some degree of continuity.\nSpline curves and the analogous spline surfaces are\ncommonly used in computer aided design to model curved\nshapes ranging from typographic fonts to automobile\nbodies. This paper presents a new perspective on\nB{{\'{e}}}zier curves and splines based on a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between univariate polynomials of degree\nk and symmetric k-variate polynomials of degree one in\neach variable. The author uses this perspective to\nderive the standard constructions for B{{\'{e}}}zier curves\nand splines in a manner that gives perspicuous labels\nto the points arising at all the steps of these\nconstructions; to elucidate the conditions that govern\nthe degree of continuity achieved at the joints of\nsplines; and to explore a variety of related topics,\nincluding spline surfaces, geometric continuity, and\npiecewise parametric rational curves. The text is\nintended to be self-contained, requiring no previous\nstudy of the theory of splines, and it succeeds in this\ngoal. The key ideas are carefully introduced, examined\nfrom multiple points of view, and illustrated with\nnumerous figures and examples. The text does, however,\ndemand of the reader a certain ability to deal\ncomfortably with mathematical abstractions -- the\nquality that my college math professors referred to as\n``mathematical maturity.'' In return, it offers not\nonly considerable insight into the theory of\nB{{\'{e}}}ziers and splines, but also a variety of\ninteresting mathematical sidelights, such as an unusual\nproof of the theorem that the medians of a triangle\ntrisect each other (Exercise 7.7a: Generalize this\nproof to higher dimensions) and a discussion of\nZeeman's ``umbilic bracelet'' (characterizing the set\nof cubics with three real roots).

abstract = {In this first chapter we consider the following fundamental problem: Given a set of points in the plane, determine a smooth curve that approximates the points. The algorithm for determining the curve from the points should be well suited for implementation on a computer. That is, it should be efficient and it should not be overly sensitive to roundoff errors in the computations. We only consider methods that involve a relatively small number of elementary arithmetic operations; this ensures that the methods are efficient. The sensitivity of the methods to round-off errors is controlled by insisting that all the operations involved should amount to forming weighted averages of the given points. This has the added advantage that the constructions are geometrical in nature and easy to visualise. In Section 1.1 we discuss affine and convex combinations and the convex hull of a set of points, and relate these concepts to numerical stability (sensitivity to rounding errors), while in Section 1.2 we give a brief and very informal introduction to parametric curves. The first method for curve construction, namely polynomial interpolation, is introduced in Section 1.3. In Section 1.4 we show how to construct Bezier curves, and in Section 1.5 we generalise this construction to spline curves. At the outset, our construction of spline curves is geometrical in nature, but in Section 1.6 we show that spline curves can be written conveniently in terms of certain basis functions, namely B-splines. In the final section, we relate the material in this chapter to the rest of the book.},

Since the early 60's Bezier and B spline representations evolved as the major tool to handle curves and surfaces. These representations are geometrically intuitive and meaningful and they lead to constructive numerically robust algorithms. It is the purpose of this book to provide a solid and unified derivation of the various properties of Bezier and B-spline representations and to show the beauty of the underlying rich mathematical structure. The book focuses on the core concepts of Computer-aided Geometric Design (CAGD) with the intent to provide a clear and illustrative presentation of the basic principles as well as a treatment of advanced material, including multivariate splines, some subdivision techniques and constructions of arbitrarily smooth free-form surfaces. In order to keep the book focused, many further CAGD methods are ex cluded. In particular, rational Bezier and B-spline techniques are not ad dressed since a rigorous treatment within the appropriate context of projec tive geometry would have been beyond the scope of this book.},

It provides a gentle introduction to some key principles that will be used throughout the book, with a touch of mathematics and plenty of illustrative examples. This is followed by an introduction to the programming tools that will be used in the fol- lowing two parts of the book, Python, Csound, and Faust. These three languages were judiciously chosen to cover a wide variety of applications, which range from demonstrating signal-processing algorithms to implementing full applications. An- other important feature of these three environments is that they can be nicely inter- leaved, from a higher to a lower level, and from an application-development to a signal-processing function. This is demonstrated by a full example at the end of the chapter.},

abstract = {How Designers Think is based on Bryan Lawson's many observations of designers at work, interviews with designers and their clients and collaborators. This extended work is the culmination of forty years' research and shows the belief that we all can, and do, design, and that we can learn to design better. The creative mind continues to have the power to surprise and this book aims to nurture and extend this creativity. Neither the earlier editions, nor this book, are intended as authoritative prescriptions of how designers should think but provide helpful advice on how to develop an understanding of design. In this fourth edition, Bryan Lawson continues to try and understand how designers think, to explore how they might be better educated and to develop techniques to assist them in their task. Some chapters have been revised and three completely new chapters added. The book is now intended to be read in conjunction with What Designers Know which is a companion volume. Some of the ideas previously discussed in the third edition of How Designers Think are now explored more thoroughly in What Designers Know. For the first time this fourth edition works towards a model of designing and the skills that collectively constitute the design process.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {So far we have looked at the geometry of a plane curve and demonstrated that it is possible to define its discrete analogue. The formulas for length and curvature of a discrete curve (a polygon) are immediately amenable to computation. Convergence guarantees that in the presence of abundant computational resources we may refine our discrete curve until the measurements we take match to arbitrary precision their counterparts on a smooth curve. We discussed an example of structure preservation, namely that the Turning Number Theorem holds exactly for discrete curves, even for coarse mesh sizes. If we wrote an algorithm whose correctness relied on the Turning Number Theorem, then the algorithm could be applied to our discrete curve. The following chapters will extend our exploration of discrete analogues of the objects of differential geometry to the settings of surfaces and volumes and to application areas spanning physical simulation (thin shells and fluids) and geometric modeling (remeshing and parameterization). In each application area algorithms make use of mathematical structures that are carried over from the continuous to the discrete realm. We are not interested in preserving structure just for mathematical elegance-each application demonstrates that by carrying over the right structures from the continuous to the discrete setting, the resulting algorithms exhibit impressive computational and numerical performance.},

@book{Aspromourgos1998,
abstract = {The unifying purpose of this study is to provide an account of the origin and formation of the classical theory of distribution, to 1767. More specifically, the aim of what follows is to trace the formative history of a central idea in economic theory: the concept of economic or social ‘surplus' as a fundamental determinant of a range of economic phenomena, especially income distribution and commodity exchange values. This conception of surplus as a basic organizing principle for economic analysis belongs to the history of ideas—not only in the obvious sense, as a creature of human invention or discovery, but also in the sense that during the latter half of the nineteenth century it was replaced as the dominant framework for theorizing economic phenomena in general and income distribution in particular, by the marginalist theories of Jevons (1871), Marshall (1890), Menger (1871) and Walras (1874; 1877), notwithstanding precursors. The tradition of surplus analysis persisted as a living theory only in the thought of Marx and the more or less incoherent forms a residual classicism took in post-Marxian Marxism. A rigorous and coherent reconstruction of the surplus approach, at least with regard to income distribution and values, only fully emerges in Piero Sraffa's Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities: prelude to a critique of economic theory (1960)—notwithstanding, as almost always, the existence of some notable precursors. This study is designed to restore an understanding of the early history of this tradition—a history which was largely ‘submerged and forgotten' (Sraffa 1960:v) as a result of the success of the marginalist theories which remained dominant until Keynes, and indeed beyond. 1.1},

abstract = {Many social animals use long-distance signals to attract mates and defend territories. They face the twin challenges of discriminating between species to identify conspecific mates, and between individuals to recognize collaborators and competitors. It is therefore often assumed that long-distance signals are under strong selection for species-specificity and individual distinctiveness, and that this will drive character displacement when closely related species meet, particularly in noisy environments. However, the occurrence of signal stereotypy and convergence in rainforest species seems to contradict these ideas, and raises the question of whether receivers in these systems can recognize species or individuals by long-distance signals alone. Here, we test for acoustically mediated recognition in two sympatric antbird species that are known to have convergent songs.We show that male songs are stereotyped yet individually distinctive, and we use playback experiments to demonstrate that females can discriminate not only between conspecific and heterospecific males, but between mates and strangers. These findings provide clear evidence that stereotypy and convergence in male signals can be accommodated by fine tuning of perceptual abilities in female receivers, suggesting that the evolutionary forces driving divergent character displacement in animal signals are weaker than is typically assumed.},

@article{Oertel2010,
abstract = {In contrast to the topics discussed in previous chapters, biofluid mechanics is concerned with flows that are influenced by flexible biological surfaces. We distinguish between flows past living bodies in air or in water, such as bird flight or the swimming of fish, and internal flows, such as the closed blood circulation of living beings. In the previous millions of years, evolution has developed crawling, running, swimming, gliding, and flying as methods of motion of living beings, depending on their size and weight. The necessary propulsion for altering position requires flow control adapted to the Reynolds number of the motion. The motion of bacteria and amoebae takes place at very small Reynolds numbers, where friction dominates, with cilia and flagella. Tadpoles and octopuses use the inertia of jet propulsion for motion. Eels move in a wavelike manner; whales use vortex separation at the tail fin for motion at Reynolds numbers of up to 108. Fast-swimming fish such as the shark have longitudinal grooves on their scales that affect the viscous sublayer of the flow boundary layer so that the flow drag is reduced. Heat and mass transport in living beings takes place in circulatory systems. These include respiration, the circulatory system of the blood, and the lymph, as well as that of water. All biological flows have in common that the motion is affected by external or internal highly flexible and structured surfaces. This leads to an actively controlled flow whose losses are kept small. Of the many different biological flows, in this chapter we will treat the flying of birds, the swimming of fishes as well as looking at the blood circulation of the human body in depth.},

Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:90-5. Objective: To compare the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions in male veterans aging with spinal cord injury (SCI) with that of older men comparison groups. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: National community dwelling. Participants: Men 65 years and older (veterans with SCI {[}n=794] injured at least 20y, veterans {[}n=13,528], and general population {[}n=6105]). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Results: In older adult men with SCI, prevalences of diabetes, MI, stroke, and CHD were 20.30%, 18.70%, 9.84%, and 15.47%, respectively. The odds for stroke were 1.4 times higher in veterans with SCI than general veterans (P <.05), and there was a trend to higher odds for stroke in men with SCI than in the general population (P=.06). The odds for CHD were significantly lower for veterans with SCI than both comparison groups. Being a past smoker was associated with greater odds for diabetes, MI, and CHD, and being a current smoker was associated with higher odds for stroke. High blood pressure and high cholesterol levels were associated with higher odds for all conditions examined. Conclusions: Diabetes and MI were most prevalent in older adults, but the presence was similar in men with SCI (vs other men). In older adult men, SCI appeared to be protective of CHD. Stroke was most prevalent in veterans with SCI, and controlling for demographic and risk factors, SCI was associated independently with stroke. These findings may be useful for prioritizing preventive health strategies and planning long-term care for men aging with SCI.},

The audience for game theory has grown dramatically in recent years, and now spans disciplines as diverse as political science, biology, psychology, economics, linguistics, sociology, and computer science, among others. What has been missing is a relatively short introduction to the field covering the common basis that anyone with a professional interest in game theory is likely to require. Such a text would minimize notation, ruthlessly focus on essentials, and yet not sacrifice rigor. This Synthesis Lecture aims to fill this gap by providing a concise and accessible introduction to the field. It covers the main classes of games, their representations, and the main concepts used to analyze them."This introduction is just what a growing multidisciplinary audience needs: it is concise, authoritative, up to date, and clear on the important conceptual issues." -Robert Stalnaker, MIT, Linguistics and Phil...},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We refer to theories in which one ormore groups of agents (“coalitions”) deliberately get together to jointly determinewithin- group actions, while interacting noncooperatively across groups. The chapter describes a variety of solution concepts, using an umbrella model that adopts an explicit real-time approach. Players band together, perhaps disband later and re-form in shifting alliances, all the while receiving payoffs at each date according to the coalition structure prevailing at the time. We use this model to nest two broad approaches to coalition formation, one based on cooperative game theory, the other based on noncooperative bargaining. Three themes that receive explicit emphasis are agent farsightedness, the description of equilibrium coalition structures, and the efficiency implications of the various theories},

A graph is said to be Hamiltonian if it has a spanning cycle. (This corresponds to the “traveling salesman” problem; Hamiltonian graphs have not been completely characterized). The chapter also presents certain subgraphs that are known by their special names through a series of definitions. The chapter discusses various infinite families of graphs, bipartite graphs, and nontrivial graph.

@book{Stein2011,
abstract = {This first volume, a three-part introduction to the subject, is intended for students with a beginning knowledge of mathematical analysis who are motivated to discover the ideas that shape Fourier analysis. It begins with the simple conviction that Fourier arrived at in the early nineteenth century when studying problems in the physical sciences--that an arbitrary function can be written as an infinite sum of the most basic trigonometric functions. The first part implements this idea in terms of notions of convergence and summability of Fourier series, while highlighting applications such as the isoperimetric inequality and equidistribution. The second part deals with the Fourier transform and its applications to classical partial differential equations and the Radon transform; a clear introduction to the subject serves to avoid technical difficulties. The book closes with Fourier theory for finite abelian groups, which is applied to prime numbers in arithmetic progression. In organizing their exposition, the authors have carefully balanced an emphasis on key conceptual insights against the need to provide the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis. Students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences will find the theory and applications covered in this volume to be of real interest. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which Fourier Analysis is the first, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.},

abstract = {Course Notes – SIGGRAPH 99 Course Abstract Most real world applications can be reduced to the problem of function representation and reconstruction. These two problems are closely re-lated to synthesis and analysis of functions. The Fourier transform is the classical tool used to solve them. More recently, wavelets have entered the arena providing more robust and flexible solutions to discretize and reconstruct functions. Starting from Fourier analysis, the course guides the audience to ac-quire an understanding of the basic ideas and techniques behind the wavelets. We start by introducing the basic concepts of function spaces and operators, both from the continuous and discrete viewpoints. We introduce the Fourier and Window Fourier Transform, the classical tools for function analysis in the frequency domain, and we use them as a guide to arrive at the Wavelet transform. The fundamental aspects multires-olution representation and its importance to function discretization and to the construction of wavelets is also discussed. Emphasis will be given on ideas and intuition, avoiding the heavy computations which are usually involved in the study of wavelets. The attendees should have a basic knowledge of Linear Algebra, Calculus, and some familiarity with Complex Analysis. Basic knowledge of signal and image processing would be desirable.},

abstract = {The subject of Fourier Analysis is at the center of many modern sciences. Physics and engineering depend so heavily on the subject, it is hard to imag- ine even mentioning them without thinking immediately about frequency- dependent phenomena: light, sound, orbits, and vibrations to name a few. Many other scientific fields also are highly dependent upon Fourier Analy- sis for understanding even the most basic of phenomena, such as population dynamics in biology. Fourier Analysis is also essential in understanding what are some of the most common occurrences in everyday life. The various peri- odic phenomena of the sun, the moon, the tides, and the seasons are yet to be completely understood. We know the sun and moon will rise with certainty, and their secondary seasonal effect on wind and tide-related phenomena such as el Nino are still somewhat of a mystery. These periodic effects are drastic and life altering, and are naturally studied with Fourier Analysis.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

With a strong emphasis on contemporary usage, all grammar points and functions are richly illustrated with examples. Implementing feedback from users of the first edition of the Grammar, this second edition includes clearer explanations and greater emphasis on areas of particular difficulty for learners of French. This is the ideal reference grammar for learners of French at all levels, from beginner to advanced. No prior knowledge of grammatical terminology is assumed and a glossary of grammatical terms is provided.

abstract = {As one of the classical statistical regression techniques, and often the first to be taught to new students, least squares fitting can be a very effective tool in data analysis. Given measured data, we establish a relationship between independent and dependent variables so that we can use the data predictively. The main concern of Least Squares Data Fitting with Applications is how to do this on a computer with efficient and robust computational methods for linear and nonlinear relationships. The presentation also establishes a link between the statistical setting and the computational issues. In a number of applications, the accuracy and efficiency of the least squares fit is central, and Per Christian Hansen, V{\'{i}}ctor Pereyra, and Godela Scherer survey modern computational methods and illustrate them in fields ranging from engineering and environmental sciences to geophysics. Anyone working with problems of linear and nonlinear least squares fitting will find this book invaluable as a hands-on guide, with accessible text and carefully explained problems. Included are • an overview of computational methods together with their properties and advantages • topics from statistical regression analysis that help readers to understand and evaluate the computed solutions • many examples that illustrate the techniques and algorithms Least Squares Data Fitting with Applications can be used as a textbook for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses and professionals in the sciences and in engineering.},

abstract = {The extension of Kalman filtering to the case of unknown variances is known as adaptive filtering. Duncan and Horn's (1972) representation of the Kalman time-series model is exploited to derive variance-component estimates from the standpoint of regression analysis. Specifically, the MINQUE of Rao (1970) and the AUE of Horn, Horn, and Duncan (1975) are applied. These estimates are then used to formulate adaptive filters. The adaptive filters are applied to simulated data, and their performance is compared to the method of Carew and Belanger (1973). {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

We present a lower bound derived from the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the new formulation which is improved by adding valid inequalities in a cutting-plane fashion. Moreover, we present a comparison between the new lower bound and lower bounds derived from the LP relaxations of different CVRP formulations proposed in the literature. A new branch-and-cut algorithm for the optimal solution of the CVRP is described.

The text of the new edition is either completely new or significantly revised and provides extensive and complete state-of-the-art coverage of vehicle routing by those who have done most of the innovative research in the area; it emphasizes methodology related to specific classes of vehicle routing problems and, since vehicle routing is used as a benchmark for all new solution techniques, contains a complete overview of current solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. It also includes several chapters on important and emerging applications, such as disaster relief and green vehicle routing. Audience: This book is intended for both researchers and graduate level students in operations research and applied mathematics. Practitioners will find this book particularly useful.

abstract = {Major advances were recently obtained in the exact solution of vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Sophisticated branch-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithms for some of the most classical VRP variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a BCP solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of VRPs. It incorporates the key elements found in the best existing VRP algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, path enumeration, and rounded capacity cuts; all generalized through the new concepts of “packing set” and “elementarity set”. The concepts are also used to derive a branching rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branching rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best specific algorithms. Even some non-VRPs, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined the influence of two psychosocial variables mediating between disease severity and quality of life (QoL) in epilepsy; social support and mastery (measured by locus of control and self-efficacy). A model placing these two variables as mediators between disease severity and QoL was tested with structural equation modeling. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with epilepsy (58% men, age 36+/-12 years) were given the following instruments: Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Epileptic Self-Efficacy Scale, Locus of Control scale, and the World Health Organization's Quality of Life Questionnaire, the WHOQOL. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling showed good fit between the research model and the data (Bentler-Bonett Normalized Index of fit, 0.96; LISREL GFI, 0.95). Ninety percent of the variance of the WHOQOL was explained by a combination of disease severity, self-efficacy in epilepsy, social support, and locus of control. Mastery was found to mediate the correlation between disease severity and QoL, and social support was found to act as a mediator between disease severity and mastery. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings emphasize the possibility of improving QoL among patients with epilepsy by counseling and treatment aimed at reinforcing their self-efficacy and locus of control, as well as by improving their SoS.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The departure from Kirkwood's superposition approximation is qualitatively the same as that found in hard-sphere and LJ model systems. The simpler one-component model with an effective pair potential underestimates the probability of finding triplets at small separations. In this region, the polarization of the small ions exerted by the triplets becomes nonadditive, that is, the polarization cannot be described as a sum of the polarization of three separate colloidal pairs. Thus, at these separations an effective pair potential can not fully describe the effective colloidal interaction. {\textcopyright} 1991 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract Purpose – Directors play a hard-to-quantify but critical role in the success of corporations. Outside directors supplement the firm-specific knowledge of inside directors by providing expertise and monitoring. Prior research finds that outside directors who are commercial bankers can be both beneficial and costly to large, non-financial corporations. Smaller, bank-dependent corporations should benefit more than large firms from the services banker directors provide, but may also be more prone to the costs they can impose. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of bank dependency on appointments of banker directors. Design/methodology/approach – The author estimates models relating the probability of a first-time banker-director appointment to proxies of bank dependency on data for a matched sample of firms with and without banker directors drawn from a size-representative sample of Compustat firms. Findings – Bank-dependent firms are less likely to appoint bankers as directors than bank-independent firms. Bank-dependent firms are also less likely to appoint bankers whose employers are firms' creditors (i.e. affiliated bankers). Bank-dependent and bank-independent firms are indistinguishable in their probabilities of appointing unaffiliated bankers as directors. Practical implications – Bank-dependent firms with unexploited growth opportunities appear unable to ameliorate their financial constraints by having banker directors. Appointing retired bankers to boards may give firms the benefits of banker directors without the costs. Originality/value – This paper is the first to: document the prevalence of banker directors at smaller corporations; present econometric evidence on banker-director appointments at firms ranging from small to large; and identify bank dependency as a factor limiting appointments of affiliated banker directors.},

abstract = {The FRM Handbook provides the core body of knowledge for financial risk managers. Risk management has rapidly evolved over the last decade and has become an indis- pensable function in many institutions. This Handbook was originally written to provide support for candidates taking the FRM examination administered by GARP. As such, it reviews a wide variety of prac- tical topics in a consistent and systematic fashion. It covers quantitative methods, capital markets, as well as market, credit, operational, and integrated risk manage- ment. It also discusses the latest regulatory, legal, and accounting issues essential to risk professionals. Modern risk management systems cut across the entire organization. This breadth is reflected in the subjects covered in this Handbook. This Handbook was designed to be self-contained, but only for readers who already have some exposure to financial markets. To reap maximum benefit from this book, readers should have taken the equivalent of an MBA-level class on investments. Finally, I wanted to acknowledge the help received in the writing of this second ed- ition. In particular, I would like to thank the numerous readers who shared comments on the previous edition. Any comment and suggestion for improvement will be wel- come. This feedback will help us to maintain the high quality of the FRM designation.},

abstract = {In stylistics, characterisation commonly refers to the cognitive process by which readers comprehend fictional characters. In effect, characterisation is the process of forming an impression of a character in your head as you read. This includes determining the personal qualities of the character in question as well as other aspects such as their social and physical characteristics. In this chapter I explain how stylistics has tackled the issue of characterisation. I begin by discussing four different views of the ontological status of characters. I argue in favour of the standpoint that sees characters as mental representations in readers' heads. Consequently, I outline a particularly influential cognitive stylistic model of characterisation proposed by Culpeper (2001). I show how this can be used to uncover aspects of characterisation by analysing a number of extracts from prose and dramatic texts, as well as a longer extract from Dennis Potter's 1978 TV drama Pennies from Heaven (D. Potter 1996). I focus particularly on the opening scene of the first episode. Finally, I demonstrate the practical value of understanding the characterisation process by analysing the hearing-impaired subtitles for the scene from the Pennies from Heaven DVD (Pennies from Heaven 1978). I show how the differences between these and the original dialogue are likely to impact on viewers' impressions of the two characters in the scene.},

One difficulty that has prevented a more extended utilization of natural fibers is the lack of good adhesion to most polymeric matrices. The hydrophilic nature of natural fibers adversely affects adhesion to a hydrophobic matrix, resulting in poor strength properties. In order to give an overview of the problems that have to be overcome when using a natural fiber, a review of their nature and configuration is made.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, due to the increased environmental awareness, numerous studies for production of biocomposites based on natural fibers have been published and many comprehensive reviews have been published. Compared with conventional reinforcements, such as glass and carbon fibers, natural fibers which are renewable resources, offer several other advantages including a wide availability (based on different vegetable species), recyclability, low density and low costs, low abrasion and preserving mechanical properties. Application of cellulose fibers in composites is not only beneficial from an ecological point of view, lowering the environmental impact of the final product within the production, usage and disposal period, but it offers further technical and economical benefits. Especially, natural fiber-reinforced biocomposites have the potential to replace current materials used for automotive industrial applications. In order to obtain composites with the best mechanical properties, most of the research activities in the last decades have been concentrated on the surface physical and chemical modifications of the fibers mainly to optimize their interfacial behavior. In the first part of this work, besides the overview of the state-of-the-art description regarding biocomposites, we will also present characterization results of the lab-scaled flax fiber reinforced biopolymer matrices (PLA) as well as compared with the same-industrially produced composites. In the second part of the paper, biocomposites based on “self-reinforced cellulose” or “all-cellulose” composites prepared from cotton textile fabrics by partial fiber surface dissolution in lithium chloride dissolved in N, N-dimethylacetamide will be presented. Two different parameters have been studied: (i) surface treatment medium (alkaline/enzyme/bleaching) and (ii) cotton textile preforms (knits, woven).},

abstract = {Introduction This book addresses core questions about the role of materials in general and of wood in particular in the construction of string instruments used in the modern symphony orchestra - violins, violas, cellos and basses. Further attention is given to materials for classical guitars, harps, harpsichords and pianos. While some of the approaches discussed are traditional, most of them depend upon new scientific approaches to the study of the structure of materials, such as for example wood cell structure, which is visible only using modern high resolution microscopic techniques. Many examples of modern and classical instruments are examined, together with the relevance of classical techniques for the treatment of wood. Composite materials, especially designed for soundboards could be a good substitute for some traditional wood species. The body and soundboard of the instrument are of major importance for their acoustical properties, but the study also examines traditional and new wood species used for items such as bows, the instrument neck, string pegs, etc. Wood species' properties for musical instruments and growth origins of woods used by great makers such as Antonio Stradivari are examined and compared with more recently grown woods available to current makers. The role of varnish in the appearance and acoustics of the final instrument is also discussed, since it has often been proposed as a ‘secret ingredient' used by great makers. Aspects related to strings are commented. As well as discussing these subjects, with many illustrations from classical and contemporary instruments, the book gives attention to conservation and restoration of old instruments and the physical results of these techniques. There is also discussion of the current value of old instruments both for modern performances and as works of art having great monetary value. The book will be of interest and value to researchers, advanced students, music historians, and contemporary string instrument makers. Musicians in general, particularly those playing string instruments, will also find its revelations fascinating. It will also attract the attention of those using wood for a variety of other purposes, for its use in musical instruments uncovers many of its fundamental features.},

Green composites offer a significant environmental key for both food and non-food market including the aerospace, automotive, decking and for others variety of structural applications over the past decades because of their relatively higher specific modulus and strength compared to metals. Developed bio-material undoubtedly delivers greater impact on the world economy by developing energy saving products for the improvement of life quality. Present study is designed to deliver an outline of the comprehensive recent research studies and works reported on sustainable “green” friendly biocomposites, focusing the concern on biopolymers, natural fibers, composite processing and their diverse structural applications.

Strictly speaking, materials science involves investigating the relationships that exist between the structures and properties of materials (i.e., why materials have their properties). In contrast, materials engineering involves, on the basis of these structure–property correlations, designing or engineering the structure of a material to produce a predetermined set of properties. From a functional perspective, the role of a materials scientist is to develop or synthesize new materials, whereas a materials engineer is called upon to create new products or systems using existing materials and/or to develop techniques for processing materials.

Without it, a number of consumer and commercial products, such as DVD, videophone, digital camera, MP3, video-streaming and wireless PCS, would have been virtually impossible. Transforming the data to a frequency or other domain enables even more efficient compression. By illustrating this intimate link, The Transform and Data Compression Handbook serves as a much-needed handbook for a wide range of researchers and engineers. The authors describe various discrete transforms and their applications in different disciplines. They cover techniques, such as adaptive quantization and entropy coding, that result in significant reduction in bit rates when applied to the transform coefficients. With clear and concise presentations of the ideas and concepts, as well as detailed descriptions of the algorithms, the authors provide important insight into the applications and their limitations. Data compression is an essential step towards the efficient storage and transmission of information.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Second, they are light on theory and examples: theyre mostly descriptions of algorithms and handwavy, intuitive explanations about why and where youd want to use them. Third, theyre chock full of algorithms great and small. I think these notes would best serve as a complement to a textbook, but can also stand alone as rapid introduction to the field. I make no guarantees whatsoever about the correctness of the algorithms or text in these notes. Indeed, theyre likely to have a lot of errors. Please tell me of any errors you find (and correct!). Some complex algorithms have been presented in simplified versions. In those cases Ive noted it.},

@book{Bjorck2015,
abstract = {Work on this book started more than 15 years ago, when I began a revision of a textbook from 1974 on numerical methods. That book devoted only about 90 pages to matrix computations compared to the more than 700 pages of the present book. This difference reflects not only a change in ambition, but also an increase in size and importance of the subject. A stunning growth in hardware performance has allowed more sophisticated mathematical models to be employed in sciences and engineering. In most of these applications, solution of systems of linear equations and/or eigenvalue problems lies at the core. Increased problem sizes and changes in computer architecture have also made the development of new methods and new implementations of old ones necessary. Although there is a link between matrix computations and linear algebra as taught in departments of mathematics, there are also several important differences. Matrices are used to represent many different objects such as networks and images, besides linear transformations. Concepts such as ill-conditioning, norms, and orthogonality, which do not extend to arbitrary fields, are central to matrix com- putations. This is the reason for not using ‘‘linear algebra'' in the title of the book.},

abstract = {Aim: The Patient Education Programme for Parkinson's disease (PEPP) was assessed in a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT). In this study, a trend was identified towards significant improvement of patients' quality of life (Qol) as well as a significant reduction of caregivers' psychosocial burden and need for help. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the PEPP in clinical practice as compared with the RCT in an academic setting. The second aim is to assess its effectiveness in clinical practice at 6-month follow-up. Methods: Fifty-five patients and 50 caregivers from nine clinical settings participated in the PEPP consisting of eight weekly sessions of 90 min. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess patients' Qol (PDQ-39) and caregivers' psychosocial burden and need for help (BELA-A-k) at baseline, directly after the programme and at 6-month follow-up. To compare the baseline data and short-term effects, data were used from an RCT study which included 64 Parkinson's disease patients and 46 caregivers. Results: Compared with the RCT control group, significant effects, after Bonferoni adjustment, were found for patients' Qol as well as for caregivers' psychosocial burden and need for help. No significant changes were found between baseline scores compared with 6-month follow-up. Scores returned to baseline levels at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: Effects from the RCT study were replicated and the effect on patients' Qol was now significant. However, at 6-month follow-up, scores returned to baseline levels, indicating the need for some form of a booster session.},

abstract = {Learning how to recognize and anticipate the legal risks associated with student affairs practice is a crucial skill all successful administrators must develop. This can be done by developing a sense for scanning the broad legal environment and being aware of legal issues in other parts of the education enterprise. Good professionals make a considerable effort to remain current in their career fields. Professional associations assist their members in this task by developing training and professional development programs that address the critical skills that professionals need to do their jobs. In higher education and student affairs, many practitioners acknowledge the importance of knowing how the law affects what they do. Constitutional law affects what kinds of rules and regulations public institutions promulgate. Contract law affects the type of business relationship administrators have with students and other constituents. Tort law affects how managers maintain facilities and supervise student events. As a result, professional associations have been created to focus attention solely on legal issues in higher education (e.g., Education Law Association and the Association for Interdisciplinary Initiatives in Higher Education Law and Policy), programs on a wide variety of legal topics appear on almost every national conference schedule, many professional associations devote part of their Web sites to law and legislation (e.g., American College Personnel Association, National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and the Association for Student Judicial Affairs), and private companies publish newsletters designed to inform their readers about the latest court rulings (e.g., The College Student and the Courts by Gehring and Letzring, Synfax weekly report by Pavela). Some of these resources examine events that may be several years old since litigation takes time and initial decisions may be appealed. Many of the authors of these publications restate the facts of the particular case and give some guidance on appropriate administrative practice. These resources, however, may not always be able to identify what administrators might face on their own campuses in the near future or define decision-making processes that might help administrators avoid legal pitfalls. The purpose of this paper is to identify two important mechanisms that college administrators can use to more actively anticipate the legal issues that may occur on their own campuses. First, practitioners should scan the broad legal environment. Secondly, they should be aware of legal issues in other parts of the education enterprise. Anticipating},

It is argued that this approach may provide a much needed basis from which attempts can be made at theoretically unifying the constituents of the clinical continuum (viz., early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention). Illustrative examples germane to this approach are given with regard to how posture serves as a constraint on the emergence of reaching movements and how cortical development influences the coordination of leg movements as revealed by a study involving infants with white matter lesions. Particular attention is paid to early detection and it is recommended that further improvements to this aspect of the clinical continuum can be derived from combining serial qualitative and quantitative (kinematic) assessments with brain-imaging techniques. It is emphasized that quantitati:.'e assessments should incorporate experimental manipulations of perception, movement or posture during transitional periods in development. Concluding comments include consideration of the timing of early intervention.},

The central problem is how to evaluate a set of alternatives in terms of a number of criteria. Although this problem is very relevant in practice, there are few methods available and their quality is hard to determine. Thus, the question `Which is the best method for a given problem?' has become one of the most important and challenging ones. This is exactly what this book has as its focus and why it is important. The author extensively compares, both theoretically and empirically, real-life MCDM issues and makes the reader aware of quite a number of surprising `abnormalities' with some of these methods. What makes this book so valuable and different is that even though the analyses are rigorous, the results can be understood even by the non-specialist. Audience: Researchers, practitioners, and students; it can be used as a textbook for senior undergraduate or graduate courses in business and engineering.},

He attempts to lay out a general, interdisciplinary approach through a case study in tone-center perception , the way in which listeners perceive musical compositions to be organized into local tonal centers. Leman also addresses the somewhat more general problem of tone semantics: the "problem of how tones, in the context of other tones, relate to each other and 'behave' in a quite orderly and meaningful way" (p. 3). The systematic musicology approach emphasizes the utility of complex computer simulations, and this study focuses on the self-organization of memory structures and the role of contextual information in guiding perception. The book is aimed at a general cognitive science audience, and a considerable amount of space is devoted to relating systematic musicology to general issues in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. In this review, I concentrate on the heart of the book: Leman's artificial intelligence models and their implications for the study of music perception and cognition.

Taking a computational approach, Temperley develops models for generating these aspects of musical structure. The models he proposes are based on preference rules, which are criteria for evaluating a possible structural analysis of a piece of music. A preference rule system evaluates many possible interpretations and chooses the one that best satisfies the rules. After an introductory chapter, Temperley presents preference rule systems for generating six basic kinds of musical structure: meter, phrase structure, contrapuntal structure, harmony, and key, as well as pitch spelling (the labeling of pitch events with spellings such as A flat or G sharp). He suggests that preference rule systems not only show how musical structures are inferred, but also shed light on other aspects of music. He substantiates this claim with discussions of musical ambiguity, retrospective revision, expectation, and music outside the Western canon (rock and traditional African music). He proposes a framework for the description of musical styles based on preference rule systems and explores the relevance of preference rule systems to higher-level aspects of music, such as musical schemata, narrative and drama, and musical tension.},

abstract = {A wide range of music -- from Bach to Mozart and Brahms -- is marked by its use of some form of what is generally called "tonality": the tendency of music to focus melodically on some stable pitch or tonic and for its harmony to use functional triads. Yet few terms in music theory are more enigmatic than that seemingly simple word "tonality." Matthew Brown's Explaining Tonality: Schenkerian Theory and Beyond considers a number of disparate ways in which functional tonality has been understood. In particular, it focuses on the comprehensive theory developed by Heinrich Schenker in his monumental three-part treatise Neue musikalische Theorien und Phantasien (1906-1935). Schenker systematically investigated the ways in which lines and chords behave both locally within individual tonal phrases and globally across entire compositions. Explaining Tonality shows why Schenker was able to elucidate tonal relationships so successfully and the many advantages that his explanations have over those of his rivals. In addition, it proposes some ways in which Schenker's approach can be extended to tonal features in works from before Bach (such as Monteverdi) and after Brahms (such as Debussy, Stravinsky, and much popular music of today). Along the way, the book explores six methodological criteria that help in building, testing, and evaluating a plausible theory of tonality or, indeed, any other musical phenomenon: accuracy, scope, fruitfulness, consistency, simplicity, and coherence. It reveals how understanding the tonality of a piece can shed light on other aspects of musical composition. And, in conclusion, it describes some ways in which Schenkerian theory might fruitfully develop in the future. Matthew Brown is Professor of Music Theory at the Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, and author of Debussy's "Ib{\'{e}}ria" (Oxford University Press).},

abstract = {Creative Music Composition is designed to be an introductory textbook for music students. "Creative composition"-composing in your own style, rather than in the style of a composer of the past-is embraced by music educators not only for composition students, but for beginning performers and music educators, and is often offered to all music students and non-music majors who wish to enhance their musical creativity. With 25 years of experience teaching fledgling composers, the author tackles the key ingredients that make for successful composition, including: stimulus to the musical imagination; discussion of a variety of current musical languages; analysis of many examples from contemporary scores; technical exercises; suggestions as to how to start a composition; structures; and examinations of works from particular genres. Wilkins covers several musical languages, from folk and popular to serialism; analyses various rhythmic forms; suggests approaches for composing for a variety of instruments, from traditional to electronic ones, as well as for the human voice; addresses the nuts and bolts of score preparation; and offers career advice. For all composition students-and for music students in general-Creative Music Composition offers a clear and concise introduction that will enable them to reach their personal goals.},

abstract = {In this paper, sample preparation protocols based on common cation-exchange and Sr-specific extraction chromatographic resin were evaluated and investigated for natural geological samples prior to 87Sr/86Sr ratio measurement using MC-ICP-MS or TIMS. Several CRMs and real geological samples were digested using HF, HNO3 and HClO4 in closed vessels prior to sequential chemical purifications and then Sr isotopic ratios were determined by MC-ICP-MS or TIMS. Because HREEs reside in the Sr fraction when common cation-exhange resin is used, this purification technique is unsuitable prior to MC-ICP-MS analysis, as doubly loaded HREE interfere on Sr masses. We observe an obviously positive relationship between the radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratio and the content of HREEs in the Sr fractions, as well as a negative relationship between un-radiogenic 84Sr/86Sr or 84Sr/88Sr ratios and the content of HREEs in the Sr fractions during MC-ICP-MS Sr isotopic measurement. Such effects are insignificant for TIMS measurement, because ionization temperatures are generally lower and can be well controlled during the analyses. In contrast to the traditional Sr purification method (cation exchange resin), Sr-specific extraction chromatographic resin produces high purity Sr fractions, making it feasible for both MC-ICP-MS and TIMS.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The question of whether music has meaning has been the subject of sustained debate ever since music became a subject of academic inquiry. Is music a language? Does it communicate specific ideas and emotions? What does music mean, and how does this meaning occur? Kofi Agawu's Music as Discourse has become a standard and definitive work in musical semiotics. Working at the nexus of musicology, ethnomusicology, and music philosophy and aesthetics, Agawu presents a synthetic and innovative approach to musical meaning which argues deftly for the thinking of music as a discourse in itself—composed not only of sequences of gestures, phrases, or progressions, but rather also of the very philosophical and linguistic props that enable the analytical formulations made about music as an object of study. The book provides extensive demonstration of the pertinence of a semiological approach to understanding the fully-freighted language of romantic music, stresses the importance of a generative approach to tonal understanding, and provides further insight into the analogy between music and language. Music as Discourse is an essential read for all who are interested in the theory, analysis and semiotics of music of the romantic period.},

In Williams's view, the rhythmic forms used by the Greeks are universally intelligible, and appear in all ages and cultures, unlike melodies or scales, which vary hugely.

It is argued that longstanding methods of conceptualizing music are vulnerable to Deleuze's critique.

abstract = {How is the Beatles' "Help!" similar to Stravinsky's "Dance of the Adolescents?" How does Radiohead's "Just" relate to the improvisations of Bill Evans? And how do Chopin's works exploit the non-Euclidean geometry of musical chords? In this groundbreaking work, author Dmitri Tymoczko describes a new framework for thinking about music that emphasizes the commonalities among styles from medieval polyphony to contemporary rock. Tymoczko identifies five basic musical features that jointly contribute to the sense of tonality, and shows how these features recur throughout the history of Western music. In the process he sheds new light on an age-old question: what makes music sound good? A Geometry of Music provides an accessible introduction to Tymoczko's revolutionary geometrical approach to music theory. The book shows how to construct simple diagrams representing relationships among familiar chords and scales, giving readers the tools to translate between the musical and visual realms and revealing surprising degrees of structure in otherwise hard-to-understand pieces. Tymoczko uses this theoretical foundation to retell the history of Western music from the eleventh century to the present day. Arguing that traditional histories focus too narrowly on the "common practice" period from 1680-1850, he proposes instead that Western music comprises an extended common practice stretching from the late middle ages to the present. He discusses a host of familiar pieces by a wide range of composers, from Bach to the Beatles, Mozart to Miles Davis, and many in between. A Geometry of Music is accessible to a range of readers, from undergraduate music majors to scientists and mathematicians with an interest in music. Defining its terms along the way, it presupposes no special mathematical background and only a basic familiarity with Western music theory. The book also contains exercises designed to reinforce and extend readers' understanding, along with a series of appendices that explore the technical details of this exciting new theory.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The book follows the same general progression of diatonic to non-diatonic harmony in conventional approaches, but integrates improvisation, composition, keyboard harmony, analysis, and rhythm. Geared toward the diverse interests and abilities of today's student, Music Theory Through Improvisation places the study of harmony within improvisation and composition in stylistically diverse formats, including jazz and popular music. Keyboard realization, for students with little or no keyboard training, is the primary mode of assimilation of harmonic materials. FEATURES • Based on a user friendly system of improvisation study • Combines Jazz, Popular, Classical, and other musical sources • Enhances understanding of the creative process and the inner workings of music • Includes an Audio CD of play-along tracks for improvisation and a companion website with resources for students and instructors, www.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415997256 Edward Sarath is Professor of Music in the Department of Jazz and Improvisation Studies at the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance at University of Michigan.

abstract = {Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is a systemic disease associated in most cases with monoclonal paraproteinaemia. Although the causative role of the paraproteinaemia is supposed, the pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown. We report a 65-year-old woman with a 28-year history of disseminated indurated plaques involving her face, trunk and extremities. Since 1994 an IgG kappa paraproteinaemia was present. Current biopsies showed typical histological features of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. We treated this extraordinary widespread condition with melphalan and prednisolone. Although the serum levels of IgG kappa light chains and gamma globulins decreased, the cutaneous plaques extended rapidly in size and number, which casts doubt on the causative significance of the paraproteinaemia in the pathogenesis of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. The paraproteinaemia in patients with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma may rather reflect a secondary phenomenon than the originating cause. Pathogenetic and therapeutical concepts based thereon that have been proposed so far should be critically reconsidered.},

abstract = {In this chapter the current physiological aspects of memory and its storage are described. The characteristic features of sensory memory, short-term memory and long-term memory are discussed, with a detailed account of the formation of long-term memory. The importance of the hippocampus in the formation of memory and its storage is shown. The molecular mechanism of memory at the level of neuron is presented, with special emphasis on the role of synapses. The importance of neurotransmitters in the phenomenon of synaptic plasticity is described; but, more importantly, the involvement of dendritic spines in synaptic plasticity is emphasized. Finally, some phenomena related to brain and memory, such as language, sleep and dreams, are described briefly.},

abstract = {In many engineered systems, optimization is used for decision making at time-scales rang-ing from real-time operation to long-term plan-ning. This process often involves solving sim-ilar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under stringent time requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this solution process to directly learn the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need of solving computationally expensive large-scale paramet-ric programs in real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active con-straints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables more interpretable learning poli-cies, and inherently accounts for relevant safety constraints. Further, the number of relevant ac-tive sets is finite, which make them simpler ob-jects to learn. To learn the relevant active sets, we propose a streaming algorithm backed up by the-oretical results. Through extensive experiments on benchmarks of the Optimal Power Flow prob-lem, we observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that this is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning al-gorithm to target.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study examines the role of community-based health insurance (CBHI) in influencing health-seeking behaviour in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Community-based health insurance was introduced in Nouna district, Burkina Faso, in 2004 with the goal to improve access to contracted providers based at primary- and secondary-level facilities. The paper specifically examines the effect of CBHI enrolment on reducing the prevalence of seeking modern and traditional methods of self-treatment as the first choice in care among the insured population. METHODS Three stages of analysis were adopted to measure this effect. First, propensity score matching was used to minimize the observed baseline differences between the insured and uninsured populations. Second, through matching the average treatment effect on the treated, the effect of insurance enrolment on health-seeking behaviour was estimated. Finally, multinomial logistic regression was applied to model demand for available health care options, including no treatment, traditional self-treatment, modern self-treatment, traditional healers and facility-based care. RESULTS For the first choice in care sought, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of self-treatment among the insured and uninsured populations, reaching over 55% for each group. When comparing the alternative option of no treatment, CBHI played no significant role in reducing the demand for self-care (either traditional or modern) or utilization of traditional healers, while it did significantly increase consumption of facility-based care. The average treatment effect on the treated was insignificant for traditional self-care, modern self-care and traditional healer, but was significant with a positive effect for use of facility care. Discussion While CBHI does have a positive impact on facility care utilization, its effect on reducing the prevalence of self-care is limited. The policy recommendations for improving the CBHI scheme's responsiveness to population health care demand should incorporate community-based initiatives that offer attractive and appropriate alternatives to self-care.},

abstract = {An Advanced Introduction with OpenFOAM{\textregistered} and Matlab {\textregistered} This textbook explores both the theoretical foundation of the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and its applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Readers will discover a thorough explanation of the FVM numerics and algorithms used in the simulation of incompressible and compressible fluid flows, along with a detailed examination of the components needed for the development of a collocated unstructured pressure-based CFD solver. Two particular CFD codes are explored. The first is uFVM, a three-dimensional unstructured pressure-based finite volume academic CFD code, implemented within Matlab{\textregistered}. The second is OpenFOAM{\textregistered}, an open source framework used in the development of a range of CFD programs for the simulation of industrial scale flow problems. With over 220 figures, numerous examples and more than one hundred exercises on FVM numerics, programming, and applications, this textbook is suitable for use in an introductory course on the FVM, in an advanced course on CFD algorithms, and as a reference for CFD programmers and researchers.},

abstract = {Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell. With Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, Seven Languages hits what's essential and unique about each language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages. For each language, you'll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the language's most important features. As the book proceeds, you'll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quickly--for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them. Among this group of seven, you'll explore the most critical programming models of our time. Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system that's at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure. Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use Erlang's let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala. Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems. It's all here, all in one place. Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model system for using forward\ngenetics to elucidate mechanisms of early development. We have used\nchemical mutagenesis to screen for mutants that show defects in the CNS.\nHere we describe the isolation of the bap28 mutation that leads to\nabnormalities in the brain starting at mid-somitogenesis stages. Mutant\nembryos display excess apoptosis primarily in the central nervous system\n( CNS) and die by days 6 - 7 after fertilization. The mutation was\npositionally cloned and shown to affect a gene that encodes a large\nprotein with high similarity to the uncharacterized human protein BAP28\nand lower similarity to yeast Utp10. Utp10 is a component of a nucleolar\nU3 small nucleolar RNA-containing RNP complex that is required for\ntranscription of ribosomal DNA and for processing of 18 S rRNA. We show\nthat zebrafish Bap28 likewise is required for rRNA transcription and\nprocessing, with a major effect on 18 S rRNA maturation. We suggest that\nbap28 is required for cell survival in the CNS through its role in rRNA\nsynthesis and processing. Inhibition of p53 protein expression in bap28\nmutants led to embryos with morphologically normal appearance,\nsuggesting that p53 is involved in triggering apoptosis in the bap28\nmutant CNS. The bap28 mutation provides a genetic approach to study the\nrole of ribosome biogenesis in the development of a vertebrate embryo.},

abstract = {Scala is a modern programming language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that combines the best features of object-oriented and functional programming languages. Using Scala, you can write programs more concisely than in Java, as well as leverage the full power of concurrency. Since Scala runs on the JVM, it can access any Java library and is interoperable with Java frameworks.       Scala for the Impatient   concisely shows developers what Scala can do and how to do it. In this book, Cay Horstmann, the principal author of the international best-selling Core Java™, offers a rapid, code-based introduction that's completely practical. Horstmann introduces Scala concepts and techniques in “blog-sized” chunks that you can quickly master and apply. Hands-on activities guide you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to expert. Coverage includes   Getting started quickly with Scala's interpreter, syntax, tools, and unique idioms   Mastering core language features: functions, arrays, maps, tuples, packages, imports, exception handling, and more   Becoming familiar with object-oriented programming in Scala: classes, inheritance, and traits   Using Scala for real-world programming tasks: working with files, regular expressions, and XML   Working with higher-order functions and the powerful Scala collections library   Leveraging Scala's powerful pattern matching and case classes   Creating concurrent programs with Scala actors   Implementing domain-specific languages   Understanding the Scala type system   Applying advanced “power tools” such as annotations, implicits, and delimited continuations  Scala is rapidly reaching a tipping point that will reshape the experience of programming.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Probability and Statistics are studied by most science students. Many current texts in the area are just cookbooks and, as a result, students do not know why they perform the methods they are taught, or why the methods work. The strength of this book is that it readdresses these shortcomings; by using examples, often from real-life and using real data, the authors show how the fundamentals of probabilistic and statistical theories arise intuitively. A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics has numerous quick exercises to give direct feedback to students. In addition there are over 350 exercises, half of which have answers, of which half have full solutions. A website gives access to the data files used in the text, and, for instructors, the remaining solutions. The only pre-requisite is a first course in calculus; the text covers standard statistics and probability material, and develops beyond traditional parametric models to the Poisson process, and on to modern methods such as the bootstrap.},

abstract = {Text is designed for an introductory probability course at the university level for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in mathematics, physical and social sciences, engineering, and computer science. It presents a thorough treatment of ideas and techniques necessary for a firm understanding of the subject. The text is also recommended for use in discrete probability courses. The material is organized so that the discrete and continuous probability discussions are presented in a separate, but parallel, manner. This organization does not emphasize an overly rigorous or formal view of probabililty and therefore offers some strong pedagogical value. Hence, the discrete discussions can sometimes serve to motivate the more abstract continuous probability discussions. Features: Key ideas are developed in a somewhat leisurely style, providing a variety of interesting applications to probability and showing some nonintuitive ideas. Over 600 exercises provide the opportunity for practicing skills and developing a sound understanding of ideas. Numerous historical comments deal with the development of discrete probability. The text includes many computer programs that illustrate the algorithms or the methods of computation for important problems.},

METHODS: Observational and cross-sectional study, developed at the UFPB Medical School, involving interns enrolled under the new medical course curriculum. A pretested questionnaire prepared by the authors was applied. RESULTS: The sample population was of 124 students (91.2% of the total number of interns). The average percentage of satisfied students was 49.6%, inversely correlated to the number of rotations already attended. The highest degree of satisfaction was observed in the Family Medicine rotation (76%), and the lowest in the Internal Medicine rotation (23.1%), when all aspects were evaluated. Other findings included: a lack of preceptors in associated hospitals, excessive administrative activities, conflicting relationship with residents, insufficient practice and focus on very specific problems. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that UFPB medical students' satisfaction with the internship program was low. The Internal Medicine rotation reported the lowest percentage in all aspects evaluated, while the Family Medicine rotation reported the highest. Furthermore, it was found that the Internship regulations were not being upheld adequately.},

The amplitude envelopes of 24 1/4|-oct bands (covering 100-6400 Hz) were processed in several ways (e.g., fast compression) in order to assess the importance of the modulation peaks and troughs. Results for 60 normal-hearing subjects show that reduction of modulations by the addition of noise is more detrimental to sentence intelligibility than the same degree of reduction achieved by direct manipulation of the envelope; in some cases the benefit in speech-reception threshold (SRT) is almost 7 dB. Two crossover levels can be defined in dividing the temporal envelope into two equally important parts. The first crossover level divides the envelope into two perceptually equal parts: Removing modulations either x dB below or above that level yields the same intelligibility score. The second crossover level divides the envelope into two acoustically equal peak and trough parts. The perceptual level is 9-12 dB higher than the acoustic level, indicating that envelope peaks are perceptually more important than troughs. Further results showed that 24 intact temporal speech envelopes with noise fine structure retain perfect intelligibility. In general, for the present type of signal manipulations, no one-to-one relation between the modulation-transfer function and the intelligibility scores could be established. {\textcopyright} 1995, Acoustical Society of America.

The conformal monogenic signal contains the monogenic signal as a special case for i1D signals and combines monogenic scale space, phase, direction/orientation, energy and curvature in one unified algebraic framework. The conformal monogenic signal will be theoretically illustrated and motivated in detail by the relation of the 3D Radon transform and the generalized Hilbert transform on the sphere. The main idea is to lift up 2D signals to the higher dimensional conformal space where the signal features can be analyzed with more degrees of freedom. Results of this work are the low computational time complexity, the easy implementation into existing Computer Vision applications and the numerical robustness of determining curvature without the need of any derivatives. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Tracking of an unknown frequency embedded in noise is widely applied in a variety of applications. Unknown frequencies can be obtained by approximating generalized spectral density of a periodic process by an autoregressive (AR) model. The advantage is that an AR model has a simple structure and its parameters can be easily estimated iteratively, which is crucial for online (real-time) applications. Typically, the order of the AR approximation is chosen by information criteria. However, with an increase of a sample size, model order may change, which leads to re-estimation of all model parameters. We propose a new iterative procedure for frequency detection based on a regularization of an empirical information matrix. The suggested method enables to avoid the repeated model selection as well as parameter estimation steps and therefore optimize computational costs. The asymptotic properties of the proposed regularized AR (RAR) frequency estimates are derived and performance of RAR is evaluated by numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

This article proposes a novel approach for automated extraction of ground surface along urban roads from MLS point clouds. The approach, which was designed to handle both ordered and unordered MLS point clouds, consists of three key steps: constructing vertical profile from MLS point clouds along the vehicle trajectory; extracting candidate ground points using an adaptive alpha shapes algorithm; refining the candidate ground points with an elevation variance filter. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using two types of urban street-scene point clouds. The results reveal that the ground points can be detected with an error rate of as low as 1.9%, proving that our proposed method offers a promising solution for automated extraction of ground surface from MLS point clouds.},

A widely used method to decompose a speech signal into the TFS and ENV is the Hilbert transform. Although this method has been available for about one century and is widely applied in various kinds of speech processing tasks (e.g. speech chimeras), there are only very few speech processing packages that contain readily available functions for the Hilbert transform, and there is very little textbook type literature tailored for speech scientists to explain the processes behind the transform. With this paper we provide the code for carrying out the Hilbert operation to obtain the TFS and ENV in the widely used speech processing software Praat, and explain the basics of the procedure. To verify our code, we compare the Hilbert transform in Praat with a widely applied function for the same purpose in MATLAB ("hilbert(.)"). We can confirm that both methods arrive at identical outputs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Acoustical Society of America. Previous studies have shown that lexical tone perception in quiet relies on the acoustic temporal fine structure (TFS) but not on the envelope (E) cues. The contributions of TFS to speech recognition in noise are under debate. In the present study, Mandarin tone tokens were mixed with speech-shaped noise (SSN) or two-talker babble (TTB) at five signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs; −18 to +6 dB). The TFS and E were then extracted from each of the 30 bands using Hilbert transform. Twenty-five combinations of TFS and E from the sound mixtures of the same tone tokens at various SNRs were created. Twenty normal-hearing, native-Mandarin-speaking listeners participated in the tone-recognition test. Results showed that tone-recognition performance improved as the SNRs in either TFS or E increased. The masking effects on tone perception for the TTB were weaker than those for the SSN. For both types of masker, the perceptual weights of TFS and E in tone perception in noise was nearly equivalent, with E playing a slightly greater role than TFS. Thus, the relative contributions of TFS and E cues to lexical tone perception in noise or in competing-talker maskers differ from those in quiet and those to speech perception of non-tonal languages.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the importance of temporal cues in the perception of speaker individuality and vocal emotion. Experiments of speaker and vocal-emotion recognition were carried out using an analysis/synthesis method of noise-vocoded speech (NVS). The temporal resolution of NVS was controlled by varying the upper limit of modulation frequency (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 Hz). In addition, the role of temporal cue in the different spectral resolution condition was also investigated by varying the number of channels (4, 8, and 16). The results demonstrated that temporal resolution contributes to the recognition of both speaker and vocal emotion. Therefore, temporal cues are found to be important for the perception of not only linguistic information but also speaker individuality and vocal emotion. On the other hand, the performance of speaker recognition was less sensitive to the spectral resolution, at least in the limited set of stimuli in the present study. For vocal-emotion recognition, the spectral resolution was shown to be important for recognizing only neutral, joy, and cold anger, but not sadness or hot anger. The important modulation frequency band for the perception of nonlinguistic information was suggested to be higher than that of linguistic information.},

Proposed 20 and 10 MHz low-pass filters (LPFs) are used to reduce the effective envelope BW in response to a 20 MHz long-term evolution signal applied to a 10 W power amplifier (PA). Experimental results verify that in comparison with PET, the proposed LPF method has the benefit of allowing arbitrary BW reduction and is compatible with the use of customised shaping functions. It is also shown that significant memory effects can be introduced when the effective envelope BW is reduced to less than the RF BW. To investigate the linearisability of the ET PA, the linearity before and after digital pre-distortion is also measured.},

Polynomial fitting requires a reasonably high order model to follow the steep slope of the blaze function. However, in the presence of deep spectral lines, a high order polynomial fit can result in ripples in the normalized continuum that increase errors in spectral analysis. Here, we present two algorithms for flattening the spectrum continuum. The Alpha-shape Fitting to Spectrum algorithm (AFS) is completely data-driven, using an alpha shape to obtain an initial estimate of the blaze function. The Alpha-shape and Lab Source Fitting to Spectrum algorithm (ALSFS) incorporates a continuum constraint from a lab source reference spectrum for the blaze function estimation. These algorithms are tested on a simulated spectrum, where we demonstrate improved normalization compared to polynomial regression for continuum},

abstract = {AbNtruct-Digital synthesis of music has led to the consideration of models other than the usual additive (Fourier) synthesis of waveforms. One of these methods, based on the FM equation, has been found to be of particular value due to its easy implementation and the richness and evolutionary character of its harmonic structure in time. Any useful synthesis procedure should be accompanied by a corresponding analytic procedure. In this paper we lay the foundations for such a procedure based on the discrete Hilbert transform. I. INTRODUCTION STIMULATING, challenging, and relatively new appli-cation of digital signal processing is to be found in the area of music generation via digital computer. By music gen-eration, we mean the production of purposefully structured sounds in the broad sense. That is, we wish to control not only the means of sound synthesis itself, including the shaping of timbre and other tone characteristics, but we wish to pro-vide the means to orchestrate sounds into larger structures or compositions with a minimum of restrictions in achieving whatever sort of goal we may have in mind. In short, our goal is nothing less than complete control of the sound en-vironment including the warp and woof of sound textures, rhythms, .and pitches; the entire spectrum of sound charac-teristics from which the patterned cloth of music is woven. Indeed, tomorrow's composer/performer, the weaver, may find himself as much at home with CRT terminals, graphic tablets, and joy sticks as he now does with his instruments, paper, pen, and baton. Since the creation of the first music generation program in 1958 by M. Mathews of Bell Labs [ 6 ] , an ever growing num-ber of engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and artists, all with a common goal, have been intent on converting the digital computer into a responsive and sensitive instrument capable of enhancing and extending our musical powers. The setting was eminently suited for, and indeed demanded the use of digital signal processing principles and techniques of all kinds, and few stones are being left unturned. And, just as any new area of inquiry draws heavily on the tools of the past, its own unique challenges will hopefully always con-tribute something new which may find use in other areas as well, or perhaps pave a road to new and as yet unseen areas of application. We do not need to look very deeply into the complexities of digital music generation to appreciate the need to find},

This structure allows us to obtain the curvature by just convolving the projected signal with the appropriate kernels. We show that the method performs an implicit plane fitting by convolving the projected signals with the derivative kernels. Since the algorithm is based on convolutions its implementation is straightforward for digital curves as well as images. We compare the proposed method with differential geometric curvature estimators. It turns out that the novel estimator is as accurate as the standard differential geometric methods in synthetic as well as real and noise perturbed environments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

A number of different approaches has been proposed in the past that tackle this problem using various techniques. Most papers tend to focus on a particular method, while an comprehensive comparison of the different approaches is usually missing. We present results of a large experiment, involving both common and recently proposed curvature estimation techniques, applied to triangle meshes of varying properties. It turns out that none of the approaches provides reliable results under all circumstances. Motivated by this observation, we investigate mesh statistics, which can be computed from vertex positions and mesh connectivity information only, and which can help in deciding which estimator will work best for a particular case. Finally, we propose a meta-estimator, which makes a choice between existing algorithms based on the value of the mesh statistics, and we demonstrate that such meta-estimator, despite its simplicity, provides considerably more robust results than any existing approach.},

Nevertheless, estimating the curvature of a surface mesh is a crucial step in common mesh processing algorithms, such as mesh segmentation, mesh smoothing, remeshing and others. While a wealth of approaches for estimating the curvature has been proposed in the literature, aiming at the best possible precision of the estimation, an objective study identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods was usually lacking. We present results of a comprehensive study focused on different aspects of curvature estimation. We extend some of the estimators in order to match properties of others and thus provide comparable results. The results of the study indicate that currently there is no one universally optimal method of curvature estimation.

abstract = {In general, the problem of determining the amplitude and frequency modulations (AM and FM) of a signal is ill posed because there is an unlimited number of combinations of AM and FM that will generate a given signal. Although Gabor proposed a method for uniquely defining the AM and FM of a signal, namely via the analytic signal, the results obtained are sometimes physically paradoxical. In this paper, four reasonable physical conditions that the calculated AM and FM of a signal should satisfy are proposed. The analytic signal method generally fails to satisfy two of the four conditions. A method utilizing the positive (Cohen–Posch) time-frequency distribution and time-varying coherent demodulation of the signal is given for obtaining an AM and FM that satisfy the four proposed conditions. Contrary to the accepted definition, the instantaneous frequency (i.e., the FM) that satisfies these conditions is generally not the derivative of the phase of the signal. Rather, the phase is separated into two parts, one which gives the instantaneous frequency via differentiation, and the other which can be interpreted either as phase modulation or quadrature amplitude modulation of the signal. Examples are given for synthetic signals and speech, with comparisons to the analytic signal method.},

abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the 'empirical mode decomposition' method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of 'intrinsic mode functions' that admit well-behaved Hubert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hubert transform, the 'instrinic mode functions' yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hubert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of 'intrinsic mode functions' based on local properties of the signal, which makes the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data, are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution {\textcopyright} 1998 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Autoregressive (AR) models are commonly obtained from the linear autocorrelation of a discrete-time signal to obtain an all-pole estimate of the signal's power spectrum. We are concerned with the dual, frequency-domain problem. We derive the relationship between the discrete-frequency linear autocorrelation of a spectrum and the temporal envelope of a signal. In particular, we focus on the real spectrum obtained by a type-I odd-length discrete cosine transform (DCT-Io) which leads to the all-pole envelope of the corresponding symmetric squared Hilbert temporal envelope. A compact linear algebra notation for the familiar concepts of AR modeling clearly reveals the dual symmetries between modeling in time and frequency domains. By using AR models in both domains in cascade, we can jointly estimate the temporal and spectral envelopes of a signal. We model the temporal envelope of the residual of regular AR modeling to efficiently capture signal structure in the most appropriate domain. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The theory of autoregressive (AR) modeling, also known as linear prediction, has been established by the Fourier analysis of infinite discrete-time sequences or continuous-time signals. Nevertheless, for various finite-length discrete trigonometric transforms (DTTs), including the discrete cosine and sine transforms of different types, the theory is not well established. Several DTTs have been used in current audio coding, and the AR modeling method can be applied to reduce coding artifacts or exploit data redundancies. This paper systematically develops the AR modeling fundamentals of temporal and spectral envelopes for the sixteen members of the DTTs. This paper first considers the AR modeling in the generalized discrete Fourier transforms (GDFTs). Then, we derive the modeling to all the DTTs by introducing the analytic transforms which convert the real-valued vectors into complex-valued ones. Through the process, we build the compact matrix representations for the AR modeling of the DTTs in both time domain and DTT domain. These compact forms also illustrate that the AR modeling for the envelopes can be performed through the Hilbert envelope and the power envelope. These compact forms can be used to develop new coding technologies or examine the possible defects in the existing AR modeling methods for DTTs, We apply the forms to analyze the current temporal noise shaping (TNS) tool in MPEG-2/4 advanced audio coding (AAC). {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Demodulation is an ill-posed problem whenever both carrier and envelope signals are broadband and unknown. Here, we approach this problem using the methods of probabilistic inference. The new approach, called Probabilistic Amplitude Demodulation (PAD), is computationally challenging but improves on existing methods in a number of ways. By contrast to previous approaches to demodulation, it satisfies five key desiderata: PAD has soft constraints because it is probabilistic; PAD is able to automatically adjust to the signal because it learns parameters; PAD is user-steerable because the solution can be shaped by user-specific prior information; PAD is robust to broad-band noise because this is modeled explicitly; and PAD's solution is self-consistent, empirically satisfying a Carrier Identity property. Furthermore, the probabilistic view naturally encompasses noise and uncertainty, allowing PAD to cope with missing data and return error bars on carrier and envelope estimates. Finally, we show that when PAD is applied to a bandpass-filtered signal, the stop-band energy of the inferred carrier is minimal, making PAD well-suited to sub-band demodulation. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Accurate estimation of the amplitude, or equivalently energy, envelope of a time-domain signal (waveform) is not a trivial task, though. Ideally, the amplitude envelope should outline the waveform connecting the main peaks and avoiding over fitting. In this work we propose a method to obtain a smooth function that approximately matches the main peaks of the waveform using true envelope estimation, dubbed true amplitude envelope. True envelope is a cepstral smoothing technique that has been shown to outperform traditional envelope estimation techniques both in accuracy of estimation and ease of order selection. True amplitude envelope gives a reliable estimation that follows closely sudden variations in amplitude and avoids ripples in more stable regions with near optimal order selection depending on the fundamental frequency of the signal. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

However, the definition of envelope is ambiguous and lack of an exact mathematical definition. It is commonly agreed that envelope varies slowly and in some empirical view it should pass the prominent peaks of the data smoothly. In this study, we propose an algorithm to directly use the prominent peaks and finally get the envelope by interpolation. We term it as empirical envelope estimation algorithm (EEEA). Envelope derived by EEEA has steerable smoothness and is adaptive to the data. It has clear physical meaning and has great potential in some off-line signal analysis applications, such as musical sound analysis and heart sound analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The proposed DED can obtain undistorted envelopes due to the zero phase-shift ideal bandpass filter (BPF) characteristics of the generalized harmonic wavelet (GHW). Its envelope average ability benefits from the passband designing flexibility of the GHW, and its demodulation speed can be accelerated by using a fast algorithm that only analyses signals of interest within the passband of the GHW with reduced computational complexity. The feasibility and advantage of the proposed DED are verified by simulations and experiments. With an optimized bandwidth, Brillouin frequency shift accuracy improvements of 19.4% and 11.14%, as well as envelope demodulation speed increases of 39.1% and 24.9%, are experimentally attained by the proposed DED over Hilbert transform (HT) and Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) based DEDs, respectively. Spatial resolution by the proposed DED is undegraded, which is identical to the undegraded value by HT-DED with an allpass filter characteristic and better than the degraded value by MWT-DED with a Gaussian BPF characteristic. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In quadrature demodulation, RF signal is multiplied with the sine and cosine wave reference signal and then low-pass filtered to produce the base-band complex signal, which has high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient quadrature demodulation method for B-mode and color flow imaging, in which the RF signal is demodulated by a pair of finite impulse response filters without mixing with the reference signal, to reduce the computational complexity. The proposed method was evaluated with simulation and in vivo experiments. From the simulation results, the proposed quadrature demodulation method produced similar normalized residual sum of squares (NRSS) and velocity profile compared with the conventional quadrature demodulation method. In the in vivo color flow imaging experiments, the time of the demodulation process was 5.66 ms and 3.36 ms, for the conventional method and the proposed method, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed method can maintain the performance of quadrature demodulation while reducing computational complexity.},

abstract = {Introduction: Although the envelope detection is a widely used method in medical ultrasound (US) imaging to demodulate the amplitude of the received echo signal before any back-end processing, novel hardware-based approaches have been proposed for reducing its computational cost and complexity. In this paper, we present the modeling and FPGA implementation of an efficient envelope detector based on a Hilbert Transform (HT) approximation for US imaging applications. Method: The proposed model exploits both the symmetry and the alternating zero-valued coefficients of a HT finite impulse response (FIR) filter to generate the in-phase and quadrature components that are necessary for the envelope computation. The hardware design was synthesized for a Stratix IV FPGA, by using the Simulink and the integrated DSP Builder toolbox, and implemented on a Terasic DE4-230 board. The accuracy of our algorithm was evaluated by the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) cost function in comparison with the conventional method based on the absolute value of the discrete-time analytic signal via FFT. Results: An excellent agreement was achieved between the theoretical simulations with the experimental result. The NRMSE was 0.42% and the overall FPGA utilization was less than 1.5%. Additionally, the proposed envelope detector is capable of generating envelope data at every FPGA clock cycle after 19 (0.48 µs) cycles of latency. Conclusion: The presented results corroborate the simplicity, flexibility and efficiency of our model for generating US envelope data in real-time, while reducing the hardware cost by up to 75%.},

Our previous studies on noise-vocoded speech (NVS) showed that temporal modulation cues provided by the temporal amplitude envelope (TAE) affect how vocal emotion and speaker individuality are perceived. However, it is still unclear if temporal modulation cues affect the perception of urgency. Here, we experimentally investigated whether the TAE of speech affects the perception of para-linguistic information, particularly urgency. We compared NVS in which the TAEs were identical to those of the original speech and NVS in which the TAEs had undergone low-pass or high-pass filtering. Urgency scales were derived from a paired comparison of the results and used to investigate the relationship between the temporal modulation components and urgency perception. Our findings were (1) the degree of urgency of the NVS stimuli was perceived as being similar to that of the original; (2) temporal modulation components of NVS upwards of 6 Hz were significant cues for urgency perception; and (3) temporal modulation components of NVS downwards of 8 Hz were significant cues for urgency perception. The results suggest that temporal modulation cues in the TAE play an important role in urgency perception.},

abstract = {A compact and efficient algorithm for digital envelope detection in white light interferograms is derived from a well-known phase-shifting algorithm. The performance of the new algorithm is compared with that of other schemes currently used. Principal criteria considered are computational efficiency and accuracy in the presence of miscalibration. The new algorithm is shown to be near optimal in terms of computational efficiency and can be represented as a second-order nonlinear filter. In combination with a carefully designed peak detection method the algorithm exhibits exceptionally good performance on simulated interferograms.},

abstract = {Short-time processing was employed to manipulate the amplitude, bandwidth, and  temporal fine structure (TFS) in sentences. Fifty-two native-English-speaking, normal-hearing listeners participated in four sentence-recognition experiments. Results showed that recovered envelope (E) played an important role in speech recognition when the bandwidth was > 1 equivalent rectangular bandwidth. Removing TFS drastically reduced sentence recognition. Preserving TFS greatly improved sentence recognition when amplitude information was available at a rate ≥ 10 Hz (i.e., time segment ≤ 100 ms). Therefore, the short-time TFS facilitates speech perception together with the recovered E and works with the coarse amplitude cues to provide useful information for speech recognition.},

@article{Moore2016,
abstract = {Multichannel amplitude compression is widely used in hearing aids. The preferred compression speed varies across individuals. Moore (2008) suggested that reduced sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) may be associated with preference for slow compression. This idea was tested using a simulated hearing aid. It was also assessed whether preferences for compression speed depend on the type of stimulus: speech or music. Twenty-two hearing-impaired subjects were tested, and the stimulated hearing aid was fitted individually using the CAM2A method. On each trial, a given segment of speech or music was presented twice. One segment was processed with fast compression and the other with slow compression, and the order was balanced across trials. The subject indicated which segment was preferred and by how much. On average, slow compression was preferred over fast compression, more so for music, but there were distinct individual differences, which were highly correlated for speech and music. Sensitivity to TFS was assessed using the difference limen for frequency at 2000 Hz and by two measures of sensitivity to interaural phase at low frequencies. The results for the difference limens for frequency, but not the measures of sensitivity to interaural phase, supported the suggestion that preference for compression speed is affected by sensitivity to TFS.},

abstract = {Within the cochlea, broadband sounds like speech and music are filtered into a series of narrowband signals, each with a relatively slowly varying envelope (ENV) imposed on a rapidly oscillating carrier (the temporal fine structure, TFS). Information about ENV and TFS is conveyed in the timing and short-term rate of action potentials in the auditory nerve. This paper describes the role of ENV and TFS information in pitch perception, binaural processing, and the perception of speech in the presence of background sounds. The paper also describes the effects of hearing loss and age on the processing of TFS and ENV information. The monaural and binaural processing of TFS information is adversely affected by both hearing loss and increasing age. The monaural processing of ENV information is little affected by hearing loss or by increasing age. The binaural processing of ENV information deteriorates somewhat with increasing age but is not markedly affected by hearing loss. The reduced TFS processing abilities found for older/hearing-impaired subjects may partially account for the difficulties that such subjects experience in complex listening situations.},

@article{Slama2015,
abstract = {Speech reception depends critically on temporal modulations in the amplitude envelope of the speech signal. Reverberation encountered in everyday environments can substantially attenuate these modulations. To assess the effect of reverberation on the neural coding of amplitude envelope, we recorded from single units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbit using sinusoidally amplitude modulated (AM) broadband noise stimuli presented in simulated anechoic and reverberant environments. Although reverberation degraded both rate and temporal coding of AM in IC neurons, in most neurons, the degradation in temporal coding was smaller than the AM attenuation in the stimulus. This compensation could largely be accounted for by the compressive shape of the modulation input-output function (MIOF), which describes the nonlinear transformation of modulation depth from acoustic stimuli into neural responses. Additionally, in a subset of neurons, the temporal coding of AM was better for reverberant stimuli than for anechoic stimuli having the same modulation depth at the ear. Using hybrid anechoic stimuli that selectively possess certain properties of reverberant sounds, we show that this reverberant advantage is not caused by envelope distortion, static interaural decorrelation, or spectral coloration. Overall, our results suggest that the auditory system may possess dual mechanisms that make the coding of amplitude envelope relatively robust in reverberation: one general mechanism operating for all stimuli with small modulation depths, and another mechanism dependent on very specific properties of reverberant stimuli, possibly the periodic fluctuations in interaural correlation at the modulation frequency.},

abstract = {Temporal envelope and fine structure are two prominent acoustic cues for speech perception. Most existing speech-transmission-index-based metrics make use of the temporal envelope information and discard the temporal fine structure (TFS) cue to predict speech intelligibility. Recent studies have shown that the TFS stimulus synthesized with multiband TFS waveforms contains rich intelligibility information, which is reflected as the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus. The present study first assessed the performance of using the recovered envelope from the synthesized TFS stimulus to predict the intelligibility of noise-distorted and noise-suppressed speech. The TFS stimulus was synthesized and fed as an input into the conventional normalized covariance measure (NCM) module. The results showed that the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus predicted the intelligibility as well as the original envelope extracted from the wideband speech signal did. In addition, an additive intelligibility model was designed to combine the envelope from wideband speech and the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus to predict speech intelligibility. The prediction power was significantly improved when these two envelope waveforms were integrated. The present study suggests that the recovered envelope from the TFS stimulus may be alternative acoustic information for modeling speech intelligibility and improving the prediction power of the conventional NCM-based intelligibility index.},

abstract = {The relative importance of temporal envelope and fine structure in speech and music perception was investigated by Smith et al. [Nature (London) 416, 87–90 (2002)] using "auditory chimera" in which the envelope from one sound was paired with the fine structure of another. Smith et al. found that, when 4 to 16 frequency bands were used, recognition of English speech was dominated by the envelope, whereas recognition of melody was dominated by the fine structure. In the present study, Mandarin Chinese monosyllables were divided into 4, 8, or 16 frequency bands and the fine structure and envelope of one tone pattern were exchanged with those of another tone pattern of the same monosyllable. Five normal-hearing native Mandarin Chinese speakers completed a four-alternative forced-choice tone-identification task. In the vast majority of trials, subjects based their identification of the monosyllables on the fine structure rather than the envelope. Thus, the relative importance of envelope and fine structure for lexical-tone perception resembled that for melody recognition rather than that for English speech recognition. Delivering fine-structure information in cochlear implant stimulation could be particularly beneficial for lexical-tone perception.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
