The audibility threshold of inharmonicity was measured at five fundamental frequencies. Results show that the detection of inharmonicity is strongly dependent on the fundamental frequency f0. A simple model is presented for estimating the threshold as a function of f0. The need to implement inharmonicity in digital sound synthesis is discussed. {\textcopyright}2001 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the problem of locating singing voice in music tracks. As opposed to most existing methods for this task, we rely on the extraction of the characteristics specific to singing voice. In our approach we suppose that the singing voice is characterized by harmonicity, formants, vibrato and tremolo. In the present study we deal only with the vibrato and tremolo characteristics. For this, we first extract sinusoidal partials from the musical audio signal . The frequency modulation (vibrato) and amplitude modulation (tremolo) of each partial are then studied to determine if the partial corresponds to singing voice and hence the corresponding segment is supposed to contain singing voice. For this we estimate for each partial the rate (frequency of the modulations) and the extent (amplitude of modulation) of both vibrato and tremolo. A partial selection is then operated based on these values. A second criteria based on harmonicity is also introduced. Based on this, each segment can be labelled as singing or non-singing. Post-processing of the segmentation is then applied in order to remove short-duration segments. The proposed method is then evaluated on a large manually annotated test-set. The results of this evaluation are compared to the one obtained with a usual machine learning approach (MFCC and SFM modeling with GMM). The proposed method achieves very close results to the machine learning approach : 76.8% compared to 77.4% F-measure (frame classification). This result is very promising, since both approaches are orthogonal and can then be combined. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

Some modal behaviors of a structure were explained. First, an experiment was designed to naked eye visualization of mode shapes in a thin film. Later, simulated deflections of a guitar top plate model were explored. This exploration was done through original scientific visualization software. Moreover, the developed computational tool was essential illustrating behaviors that used to be hard to visualize: acoustic waves. Sound radiation data were calculated from the vibration of the top plate model. These data were sliced to detect acoustic wavefronts and directivity patterns. Experimental and computational procedures developed in this work were useful illustrating vibroacoustic behaviors. Mode shapes and natural frequencies in the thin film experiment were clearly detected. Scientific visualization software showed ability to display vibroacoustic information in high density, with much semantic substance and time savings. The experiment can be easily implemented in a classroom, and the software can be used to explore other kind of data in standard Visualization Tool Kit format.},

abstract = {Separating singing voices from music accompaniment is an important task in many applications, such as music information retrieval, lyric recognition and alignment. Music accompaniment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace, because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method. Evaluations on the MIR-1K dataset show that this method can achieve around 1∼1.4 dB higher GNSDR compared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior training or requiring particular features. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a gating recurrent mixture density network (GRMDN) architecture to jointly address these two problems in neural network based SPSS. What's more, the gated recurrent unit (GRU), which is much simpler and has more intelligible work mechanism than LSTM, is also investigated as an alternative gating unit in RNN based acoustic modeling. Experimental results show that the proposed GRMDN architecture can synthesize more natural speech than its MSE-trained counterpart and both the two gating units (LSTM and GRU) show comparable performance.},

Our general approach is based on measuring the directivity of an acoustic violin, and designing a digital filter structure that mimics the observed directivity while allowing interactive operation. The digital filter structure is fed by the electrical signal coming from a silent electric violin as played by a musician. In a hemi-anechoic chamber, we use a microphone array to characterize the frequency-dependent directivity transfer function of a real violin by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the acoustic pressure at 4320 points on a sphere surrounding the instrument. From the input force and output pressure signals obtained from the real violin measurements, we use deconvolution to estimate 4320 impulse responses each corresponding to a radiation direction. With such impulse responses, we use State Wave Synthesis to model the observed directivity in time-varying conditions and efficiently render directional wavefronts in a virtual environment. We characterize the silent violin transfer function by exciting the bridge with an impact hammer and measuring the electrical signal at its output, leading to an impulse response that we use to design an inverse filter to recover the force excitation at the bridge.},

In this paper we propose a new approach to constructing large high quality unsupervised sets to train DNN models for large vocabulary speech recognition. The core of our technique consists of two steps. We first redecode speech logged by our production recognizer with a very accurate (and hence too slow for real-time usage) set of speech models to improve the quality of ground truth transcripts used for training alignments. Using confidence scores, transcript length and transcript flattening heuristics designed to cull salient utterances from three decades of speech per language, we then carefully select training data sets consisting of up to 15K hours of speech to be used to train acoustic models without any reliance on manual transcription. We show that this approach yields models with approximately 18K context dependent states that achieve 10% relative improvement in large vocabulary dictation and voice-search systems for Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian and Russian languages.},

The resulting instruments exhibit interesting natural vibration mode and sound radiation physics. The tone qualities of the new instruments suggest relations between the guitar response envelope and human sound perception. Translating the principle natural modes of the guitar up or down with string frequencies does not necessarily produce pleasing tone qualities nor optimal playing dynamics. However, designing bracing configurations for both classical and folk baritone and bass guitars to maximise low frequency radiation efficiency does seem to produce new instruments of musical appeal. Frequency response records of standard and guitar family variants illustrate the physical behaviour of the different designs. Experience of musicians with the guitar family instruments indicates that creative new guitar territory is available. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Frequency analysis is performed on the simulated sound pressure and plate velocity waveforms in order to evaluate quantitatively the transfer of energy through the various components of the coupled system: from the string to the soundboard and from the soundboard to the air. The effects of some structural changes in soundboard thickness and cavity volume on the produced sounds are presented and discussed. Simulations of the same guitar in three different cases are also performed: "in vacuo," in air with a perfectly rigid top plate, and in air with an elastic top plate. This allows comparisons between structural, acoustic, and structural-acoustic modes of the instrument. Finally, attention is paid to the evolution with time of the spatial pressure field.

abstract = {In this work the effect of two different bridge configurations on the vibrations of the top plate of a classical guitar is presented. Experimental harmonic analysis and visualization techniques, in addition to detailed damped simulations using the finite element method, were used to obtain mobility functions and operating deflection shapes of a top plate. The mobility functions were obtained in the following sequence. First the mobility functions were obtained on the top plate without a bridge attached. Then a bridge was glued to the top plate and new measurements were made. Finally the already attached bridge was cross-cut in situ without detaching it from the top plate, and the measurements were repeated. Those specific designs were chosen on the grounds of simplicity of construction both experimentally and in FEM simulations (no particular preference for those designs is implied). The assembly and the specific design of the bridge have shown to have considerable influence on the response of the top plate regarding the mode shapes above 300 Hz. Depending on the geometry of the bridge, its deflections can either be comparable to the maximum deflections of the top plate or can have amplitudes so small that the bridge effectively creates a nodal zone on the plate vibrations. This suggests that the shape, the stiffness, and the mass properties of the bridge may play a role in the sound quality of the instrument. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A platform for manipulation and examination the acoustic guitar is presented, based on a novel guitar design - the Chameleon Guitar - featuring a replaceable acoustic resonator functioning as the soundboard of the instrument. The goal of the design process is to create a tone as sonically close to that of a traditional guitar as possible, while maintaining an easily replaceable soundboard. An iterative, data driven approach was used, each design step coming under examination from one or more measurement tools: finite-element method, acoustic impulse testing, and laser vibrometry. Ideal resonator geometry, bridge location, and piezoelectric sensor positions were determined. The finished instrument was then examined with laser vibrometry to confirm earlier results, evaluate the behavior and chosen sensor positions for various tonewoods, and examine the acoustic effects of adding sensors and wax finish. The conclusions drawn are diverse and point to the significance of attention to detail in each step of instrument construction. For example, when changing instrument material from one softwood to another, ideal locations for piezoelectric sensors are subject to change. We conclude that detailed acoustic analysis can significantly aid in the construction of new instruments by quantifying the impact of instrument geometry and material properties. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Basically, the instrument diversity comes from different geometries of resonance box, shapes of sound hole, types of wood, different tunings, and number and arrangement of strings. This paper intends to present the numerical and experimental modal analysis of a Brazilian guitar, without strings, in a free boundary condition. The modal analysis technique is applied in the determination of the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes. The main dimensions of an actual Brazilian guitar body are used to build the computational model geometry. The numerical modal analysis uses finite element method (FEM) to determine the dynamic behavior of the vibroacoustic system, which is composed by the structural and acoustic systems coupled. The experimental modal analysis is carried out in an actual Brazilian guitar body, where the structural modal parameters (frequency and mode shape) are extracted and used to update the numerical model. Finally, numerical and experimental results are compared and discussed.},

Current research is an attempt to increase the sound level with bracing designs and their placements, control of natural frequencies using scalloped braces, aswell as improve the acoustic radiation of this instrument at higher frequencies by deliberately inducing asymmetricmodes in the soundboard using the concept of "splitting board." Variousmathematicalmethods are available for analysing the soundboard based on the theory of thin plates. Discrete models of the instrument up to 4 degrees of freedom are also presented.

abstract = {This paper presents a case study of research leading to a significant innovation in the acoustic guitar sector (1). The acoustic guitar is a result of centuries of design and development with wood, and has evolved into an archetypal and traditional product with a relatively conservative user base. As with many other product sectors, most acoustic guitars are now mass-produced in China, where low labour costs contribute to an average out-of-factory price of just $20 USID. This paper describes research into a dramatic shift in guitar materials, away from wood fabrication, towards the assembly of industrially moulded thermoplastic components. It is proposed that such a shift in materials can lead to competitive mass-manufacture of acoustic guitars outside of low labour cost countries, whilst invigorating the design of this popular musical instrument. Emphasis is placed on articulating the technical, aesthetic, market, and commercial requirements of a thermoplastic acoustic guitar. The crucial issue of sourcing appropriate forms of advice to aid product design is discussed. Focus is on the guitar soundboard, as the principal sound-generating component of the instrument. Three conclusions are reached, based on the patented soundboard technology that emerged from the research. First, instruments constructed. with foamed polycarbonate soundboards can rival the quality of wood counterparts, opening the way for a possible new industry of polymer musical instruments. Second, foamed polycarbonate soundboards have physical material properties surprisingly different to wood yet give equivalent acoustic performance. And third, innovation in this product sector benefits more from designerly ways of knowing and operating and less from scientific discoveries.},

A digital waveguide model is proposed for simulating the nonlin- earity inducing interactions between the vibrating string and the contact condition at the point of string termina- tion. The current work analyzes the resulting string mo- tion influenced by the contact conditions with mostly flat but slightly curved geometries. The effect of a minute im- perfection of the termination condition on the string vibra- tion is investigated. It is shown that the lossless string vi- brates in two distinct vibration regimes. In the beginning the string starts to interact in a nonlinear fashion with the bridge, and the resulting string motion is nonperiodic. The duration of that vibration regime depends on the geome- try of the bridge. After some time of nonperiodic vibra- tion, the string vibration settles in a periodic regime. Pre- sented results are applicable for example in the physics- based sound synthesis of stringed musical instruments, such as the shamisen, biwa, sitar, tambura, veena or even the bray harp and the grand piano.},

In contrast, codification and the practices of industrial writing have received little attention for the roles they play in mobilizing knowledge across space. This paper offers insight into the geographies of codification through an examination of technology transfer in the electronic musical instrument industry between 1965 and 1995. The research draws on a variety of primary and secondary data that include interviews with inventors, biographical accounts and patent analysis. These sources offer perspective on the career trajectories of three U.S. inventors who transferred knowledge from various contexts in California's high-tech industry to the Japanese firm, Yamaha. Conceptually, the paper draws on the actor-network theory and Latour's idea of translation to highlight the detours inventors must take to register novelty. The analysis reveals the problematic nature of codified knowledge and its transfer; in this case codified knowledge was mobile internationally but not locally, at least until it reached Japan. The paper argues for the need to understand how texts such as patents are produced-the context of their authorship, the geographies of their circulation and their efficacy for shaping further innovative practice. {\textcopyright} 2006 Canadian Association of Geographers/L'Association canadienne des g{\'{e}}ographes.},

The physics-based modelling methods can be classified as mass-spring, modal, wave digital, finite difference, digital waveguide and source-filter models. We present the basic theory and a discussion on possible extensions for each modelling technique. For some methods, a simple model example is chosen from the existing literature demonstrating a typical use of the method. For instance, in the case of the digital waveguide modelling technique a vibrating string model is discussed, and in the case of the wave digital filter technique we present a classical piano hammer model. We tackle some nonlinear and time-varying models and include new results on the digital waveguide modelling of a nonlinear string.

abstract = {Sound synthesis and processing has been the most active research topic in the field of Sound and Music Computing for more than 40 years. Quite a number of the early research results are now standard components of many audio and music devices and new technologies are continuously being developed and integrated into new products. Through the years there have been important changes. For example, most of the abstract algorithms that were the focus of work in the 70s and 80s are considered obsolete. Then the 1990s saw the emergence of computational approaches that aimed either at capturing the characteristics of a sound source, known as physical models, or at capturing the perceptual characteristics of the sound signal, generally referred to as spectral or signal models. More recent trends include the combination of physical and spectral models and the corpus-based concatenative methods. But the field faces major challenges that might revolutionize the standard paradigms and applications of sound synthesis. In this article we will first place the sound synthesis topic within its research context, then we will highlight some of the current trends, and finally we will attempt to identify some challenges for the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Collisions play an important role in many aspects of the physics of musical instruments. The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and percussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others include reed-beating efects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction in fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the wire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective, whether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or sound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various dificulties, not the least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a novel finite diference time domain simulation framework for such collision problems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical energy conservation or dissipation, and where a power law formulation for collisions is employed, as a potential function within a passive formulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and as a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of such methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are presented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation, bounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as various aspects of musical instrument physics.},

abstract = {Collisions are an innate part of the function of many musical instruments. Due to the nonlinear nature of contact forces, special care has to be taken in the construction of numerical schemes for simulation and sound synthesis. Finite difference schemes and other time-stepping algorithms used for musical instrument modelling purposes are normally arrived at by discretising a Newtonian description of the system. However because impact forces are non-analytic functions of the phase space variables, algorithm stability can rarely be established this way. This paper presents a systematic approach to deriving energy conserving schemes for frictionless impact modelling. The proposed numerical formulations follow from discretising Hamilton's equations of motion, generally leading to an implicit system of nonlinear equations that can be solved with Newton's method. The approach is first outlined for point mass collisions and then extended to distributed settings, such as vibrating strings and beams colliding with rigid obstacles. Stability and other relevant properties of the proposed approach are discussed and further demonstrated with simulation examples. The methodology is exemplified through a case study on tanpura string vibration, with the results confirming the main findings of previous studies on the role of the bridge in sound generation with this type of string instrument.},

abstract = {During the last decade, much attention has been given to sound rendering and the simulation of acoustic phenomena by solving appropriate models described by Hamiltonian partial differential equations. In this contribution, we introduce a procedure to develop appropriate tools inspired from geometric integration in order to simulate musical sounds. Geometric integrators are numerical integrators of excellent quality that are designed exclusively for Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations. The introduced procedure is a combination of two techniques in geometric integration: the semi-discretization method by Celledoni et al. (J Comput Phys 231:6770–6789, 2012) and symplectic partitioned Runge–Kutta methods. This combination turns out to be a right procedure that derives numerical schemes that are effective and suitable for computation of musical sounds. By using this procedure we derive a series of explicit integration algorithms for a simple model describing piano sounds as a representative example for virtual instruments. We demonstrate the advantage of the numerical methods by evaluating a variety of numerical test cases.},

abstract = {Acoustic musical instruments act as dynamic sound sources communicating the expressive intentions of a performer to the audience in a dedicated spatial environment. From an acoustical point of view, the directivity of musical instruments is relevant both for the loudness and timbre of an instrument at a certain position in the audience, as well as for the spatial characteristics of the generated sound field. Musical instruments, however, are dynamic sound sources always moved by musicians as an element of their performance on stage. This work aims at assessing the acoustical effect and the perceptual relevance of these movements. For this purpose, we have recorded solo musical performances with all standard orchestral instruments with an optical motion tracking system, as well as the corresponding audio signals. The effect of the movements was evaluated by analysing the spectral fluctuation and the time-dependence of room acoustical parameters in a virtual acoustic environment in anechoic and reverberant conditions. In a subsequent listening test, an auralization of the static and dynamic musical performance was presented to listeners by binaural synthesis, showing that the signal-related fluctuations are clearly audible both in anechoic and reverberant situations. We discuss different approaches how to consider these effects for the simulation of natural acoustic sources in virtual acoustic reality.},

abstract = {The physics of musical instruments often uses modal analysis as one of the most important methods for describing the behavior of sound chests and their acoustic radiation. However, some studies conducted in Europe (Wogram), Japan (Suzuki) and the United States (Giordano) underlined a very weak correlation between sound radiation and modal analysis. This mismatch required further research. The acoustic parameter intensity of acoustic radiation (IAR) is highly related to the mechanical vibration of the sound source. IAR was able to quantify the sound efficiency of musical instruments, and to relate sound radiation with modal analysis. This paper investigates IAR measured on three Persian stringed musical Instruments, namely the thar, si-thar and santoor. The analysis contributes to the knowledge of stringed musical instruments and sound propagation, since IAR is capable of linking the mechanical vibrations of soundboards with the sound generation of the musical instruments. The IAR results coming from the modal analysis carried out during the study of the instruments are reported herein.},

abstract = {Similarity is an important concept in music cognition research since the similarity between (parts of) musical pieces determines perception of stylistic categories and structural relationships between parts of musical works. The purpose of the present research is to develop and test models of musical similarity perception inspired by a transformational approach which conceives of similarity between two perceptual objects in terms of the complexity of the cognitive operations required to transform the representation of the first object into that of the second, a process which has been formulated in information-theoretic terms. Specifically, computational simulations are developed based on compression distance in which a probabilistic model is trained on one piece of music and then used to predict, or compress, the notes in a second piece. The more predictable the second piece according to the model, the more efficiently it can be encoded and the greater the similarity between the two pieces. The present research extends an existing information-theoretic model of auditory expectation (IDyOM) to compute compression distances varying in symmetry and normalisation using high-level symbolic features representing aspects of pitch and rhythmic structure. Comparing these compression distances with listeners' similarity ratings between pairs of melodies collected in three experiments demonstrates that the compression-based model provides a good fit to the data and allows the identification of representations, model parameters and compression-based metrics that best account for musical similarity perception. The compression-based model also shows comparable performance to the best-performing algorithms on the MIREX 2005 melodic similarity task.},

abstract = {Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.},

Whenever such models are used for commercial applications, an additional constraint is the time to market, making automation of the sound design process desirable. In previous works, a computational sound design approach has been proposed for the parameter estimation problem involving timbre matching by deep learning, which was applied to the synthesis of pipe organ tones. In this paper, we refine previous results by introducing the former approach in a multi-stage algorithm that also adds heuristics and a stochastic optimization method operating on perceptually motivated objective cost functions. The optimization method shows to be able to refine the first estimate given by the deep learning approach and substantially improve the objective metrics, with the additional benefit of reducing the sound design process time.

@article{Fletcher1964,
abstract = {This paper deals with the normal modes of vibration of a stiff piano string. The equations that govern the vibration of a solid string are developed along traditional lines. They are modified to apply to strings having a solid-steel core upon which are wrapped one or two copper windings. The bass strings of most pianos are made this way. Two boundary conditions are considered: namely, (1) pinned by sharp knife edges at both ends and (2) clamped at both ends. Formulas for the partial frequencies for both of these conditions are developed. The partial frequencies that are calculated by these formulas are compared to the experimental values obtained on an upright Hamilton piano. The experimental values appear to agree somewhat better with the pinned boundary condition rather than the clamped boundary condition, although the differences are not much greater than the observational error. It was found that the formula fn = nfi[(l+Bn2)/(l+B)y gives values of the partial frequencies that agree with the experimental ones where n is the number of the partial,/the fundamental frequency, and B a constant that can be calculated from the dimensions of the wire. {\textcopyright} 1964, Acoustical Society of America.

We then present experimental data showing the effects of mutual string coupling on beats and aftersound, as well as the great importance of the two polarizations of the string motion. The function of the una corda pedal in controlling the aftersound is explained, and the stylistic possibilities of a split damper are pointed out. The way in which an excellent tuner can use fine tuning of the unisons to make the aftersound more uniform is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1977 by the Acoustical Society of America},

The paper applies recent developments in piano modeling and focuses on the issues related to practical implementation (e.g., numerical stability, aliasing, and efficiency). A strong emphasis is given to modeling nonlinear string vibrations, and a new variation of earlier synthesis techniques is proposed which is particularly well suited for modal synthesis. For soundboard modeling, the possibilities of using fast Fourier transform-based fast convolution and parallel second-order filters are discussed. Additionally, the paper describes the details of the software implementation and discusses the computational complexity of each model block. The piano model runs on current computer hardware with full polyphony in real time. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Design limitations relating to materials, performance, or tone quality are noted. The effect of varying a parameter is described or illustrated graphically when feasible. Data comparing pianos of various size and design are shown. Examples are shown of the use of mobility measurements in assessing soundboard and string plate performance. The potential value of modal and finite element analysis in design work is noted. Although the piano is regarded by many people as fully developed, the author believes that there has never been a better time for improvement. Some directions for future work are indicated.},

This performance mimics the real singing of a singer that has been previously recorded, analyzed and stored in a database, in which we store his voice characteristics (phonetics) and his low-level expressivity (attacks, releases, note transitions and vibratos). To synthesize such performance the systems concatenates a set of elemental synthesis units (phonetic articulations and stationeries). These units are obtained by transposing and time-scaling the database samples. The concatenation of these transformed samples is performed by spreading out the spectral shape and phase discontinuities of the boundaries along a set of transition frames that surround the joint frames. The expression of the singing is applied through a Voice Model built up on top of a Spectral Peak Processing (SPP) technique. SPP considers the spectrum as a set of regions. Each region is made up of one spectral peak and its surroundings and can be shifted both in frequency and amplitude. The Voice Model is based on an improved version of the traditional excitation/filter approach. The system will be demonstrated with several performances.},

The spectral envelope of speech is used as a model for the orchestration. The idea of this method is to synthesise the spectral envelope of a phoneme using the spectral envelopes of different sounds of music instruments. Large instrumental databases with standardised intensities like the Virtual Orchestra are required. For each sound of the database, an average spectral envelope is calculated. An error minimisation algorithm optimises the similarity of the orchestration's envelope in relation to the phoneme. Among other pieces, this method was applied in the orchestra piece Nicanor, premiered 1999 in Stuttgart. A considerable similarity of the respective orchestral sequence to the sound of the whispered word is perceived.},
